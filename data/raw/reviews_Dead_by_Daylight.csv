Changes that shouldn't take more than one update end up taking years (if they even happen). The developers are still repeating the same mistakes they ""learned"" from years ago, there doesn't seem to be any quality control in terms of balance or gameplay.

The game doesn't appreciate the time you spend on it or the money you put into it, I just cannot recommend this buggy mess, the worst part is that it will most likely never change, there is no competetion to push the developers into the right direction and partly because of their awful legacy code still influencing their decisions to this day.",False,1,488335

I tend to main killer but with the recent 2v8 matches I was able to get a better grasp of how to play survivor better which was something i struggled with a bit. the tutorial isn't great so i do recommend looking up vids for better ones. This game does offer custom matches so you can choose to play with friends as well which can be a great way to learn the game and each characters strengths and weaknesses. overall a fun game with lots of cool characters and pretty graphics.

With the recent update the game got even more brain dead then before. They just didn't remove any ""save"" pallets, they just made everything a 50 that's is basically a free hit for the killer all the time. Instead of keeping a skill ceiling, forcing killers and surv to improve on movement to get better and win they just took every skill out of the game. I am surprised there is still shack and jungle gyms... Next update these 2 will prob also get removed. Why giving a game a skill ceiling, letting players learn checkspots and killers what good movement is when u can just make everything a 50 that the killer CAN'T EVEN LOSE...

Dead by Daylight,381210,210553479,"This game perfectly balances panic, betrayal, and pure chaos!

As a survivor, you get to sprint in circles around a small wooden hut while being chased by a 7ft maniac with an eye watering weapon and bad personal hygiene. Your aim (alongside staying alive) is to fix generators that have a personal vendetta against you, causing tiny heart attacks with every skill check. And after all that; the majority of matches will end with you screaming into the void while decorating a hook as your so called teammates leg it out of the freshly opened door.

As a killer, it’s even better. You chase someone for what seems to be a lifetime as you swing your oversized murder stick like you're trying to shoo away a mosquito, and still somehow manage to feel like a God! You curse every blind and every single pallet stun becomes a personal insult. Every hook is a triumph, with every survivors scream an applause for your dedication to the cause.

In short: This game is a rage baiting masterclass in panic-induced cardio, emotional trauma, and chaotic fun with enough salt in the community to give you hypernatremia!

-No slugging

A few minutes ago, I played my first match as killer this year (I honestly never played killer much on Steam before), and with the SBMM (matchmaking system) they came up with, you'd expect a complete killer rookie to get matched with at least a couple of rookie survivors, right? Think again. Because what I got were four complete tryhard veteran survivors with flashbangs, flashlights, and all sorts of sweaty perks.

They played freaking well, so well that I found myself wondering mid-match why they even bother making a matchmaking system if it's going to be this random. I literally rage-quit after all gens were done in roughly four minutes, and I only got two downs. The good old days where you could play killer and just have fun are over. I won't play killer again in this game, and it totally makes sense why tunneling and camping became widespread strategies.

Dead by Daylight,381210,210419287,"People may call you a Camper, Tunneler, Gen-rusher, or Toxic player but most of this comes from frustration. Here’s what’s really happening in these situations and how both Survivors and Killers can reduce that frustration.

SURVIVORS
We’ve all said it: “You’re camping,” “You’re tunneling,” “OP perks,” “You suck.” These come from feeling powerless or targeted. But instead of blaming, it’s worth understanding why these things happen and how to counter them.

CAMPING

A killer sitting on a hook for the full 2 minutes feels awful. But camping is actually a huge mistake for the killer.

• A survivor takes 120 seconds to die on hook.
• One survivor doing a gen takes ~80 seconds (~100 with Ruin).
• So if the killer camps, do gens instead of going for risky saves.

If a killer fully camps a first hook, you can finish about 3 gens. If they camp again, that’s 2 more. A camping killer realistically caps out at about 2 kills max and earns very few points. When you punish camping with gen pressure instead of feeding more hooks, killers eventually learn it doesn’t work.

TUNNELING

Getting tunneled is miserable, but it's often set up by survivor mistakes that the killer simply capitalizes on.

Killers prioritize:

• The closest targets
• Injured survivors
• Survivors who are already hooked (best value for slowdown and pressure)

If the killer is near the hook when the unhook happens, they will naturally return—there are guaranteed survivors there, one of them injured.

To reduce tunneling:

•Don’t unhook in the killer’s terror radius unless it’s absolutely necessary.
•If the killer never leaves the hook, it's camping/proxy camping—so leave and do gens.
•Communicate with teammates: unsafe unhooks cause tunneling.
•Learn to punish killers through pressure, not insults.",True,0,16365

Dead by Daylight,381210,210371196,"I see a lot of comments saying it isn't beginner friendly and as a new player, I'll be honest. It doesn't FEEL beginner friendly, but in the sense that match making seems a bit off balance. I feel like I'm constantly matched with insane killers who clearly have been playing this game for many years. But in all honesty that doesn't prevent the game from being fun. Sure, it sucks when a killer tunnel visions on you or just goes super hard for no reason, but that's also the nature of these games so I don't really hold that against the game itself. I think skill based match making could be better, but eh.

I will say I went into playing afraid it was going to be pretty toxic but I didn't realize that most people just don't talk? So if you've been afraid to play because you've been afraid to deal with being flamed/dealing with toxic people screaming at you, that's not the case. Just get in a public lobby and play, it's actually pretty chill and in the 10 hours I've played I've yet to really encounter any people raging over it. Most people have seemed either friendly, or chill.

I also went into the game thinking it would be super clunky but surprisingly moving around actually feels really smooth and easy.

Dead by Daylight,381210,210279920,"Absolutely Love this game but caters too much towards survivors recently than killers. (Does it deserve labor of love after the livestream with chandler riggs from walking dead? Heck no)

Picking up this game is pretty annoying because you will literally have no idea how to start, and what to do and the tutorial doesn't tell you anything on how to play correctly, you have to watch tutorials on youtube if you want to know how to play.

Casually this game is incredibly fun, and addicting with friends or without, but competitive it becomes not as fun as a game even more so if you have no clue how to play.

It's easy to pick up survivor as a beginner but if your playing killer for the first time it is definitely way difficult to experience.

But in my opinion I have been finding the 2v8 gamemode to be so incredibly fun even as killer. Everything about the gamemode I love, and the flaws of this gamemode are nothing compared to the regular game.

All in all a solid experience for a party game, and horror. (sometimes this game still does scare me)

There is simply nothing else like it, and honestly, I don’t think the world could handle two of these anyway.

One thing I absolutely adore is how wildly inclusive this game is. DBD doesn’t just welcome every community, it throws the door open, hands you a flashlight, and says “get in loser, we’re looping.” Horror lovers, queer icons, sweaty tryhards, cozy gamers, lore nerds, chaos gremlins, the eternally doomed, the perpetually carried, everyone fits here. Behaviour keeps adding characters, stories, and cosmetics that make the Fog feel like a place where every kind of player can exist loudly and beautifully.

And the gameplay? Lord help me. It’s messy, toxic, romantic, terrifying, sexy, hilarious, and deeply embarrassing at times. Every match feels like its own chaotic little relationship. One minute you’re confidently looping a killer like a goddess, the next you’re tripping over a rock and dying in the corner like it’s your first day on a controller. But that’s the charm. Every round is unpredictable, dramatic, and deliciously tense.

A decade later, this game is still my comfort, my chaos, my adrenaline rush, my therapy session, and my late night “just one more match” addiction. If you want a game that’s inclusive, creative, constantly evolving, and absolutely unhinged in the best way, Dead by Daylight is the one.

Still here, still screaming, still stunning, still repairing gens like my life depends on it.

THIS GAME IS NOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY and takes alot of dedication and time to thoroughly learn. i still consider myself new to survivor with 500+ hours as of this review (around 100-150) on survivor. the community can often be toxic to new players so thats definitley something to be prepared for. i would reccomend playing this gamer with friends if u have any",True,0,33070

Dead by Daylight,381210,210223820,"Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric 4v1 horror game where one killer hunts four survivors trying to escape. Released in 2016, the game has grown massively with new characters, maps, and collaborations.

Story
The narrative centers around “The Entity,” a supernatural force that traps both killers and survivors in endless trials. Each character has a backstory, but the main plot is intentionally fragmented, giving the game a mysterious, haunting atmosphere.

Gameplay
Survivors must repair generators, avoid the killer, rescue teammates, and open exit gates. It’s all about stealth, teamwork, and decision-making. Killers, on the other hand, must track survivors, use unique powers, and sacrifice them to The Entity. Matches are tense, unpredictable, and often chaotic, which is part of the charm — and frustration. The learning curve is steep on both sides, but rewarding once you understand perks, loops, and mindgames.

Graphics
The visuals have been significantly improved over the years. Maps are atmospheric, lighting is solid, and the killer designs are detailed and intimidating. Still, animations can feel stiff, and some textures look dated, especially compared to newer horror titles.

Music & Sound
The soundtrack fits the tone: eerie, minimalistic, and tension-driven. Chase music varies per killer and adds personality to each encounter. Audio cues are crucial — footsteps, grunts, and terror radius all shape the gameplay experience.

Conclusion
Dead by Daylight isn’t perfect: it has balance issues, occasional bugs, and a sometimes harsh matchmaking system. But despite its flaws, it remains one of the most unique and replayable horror multiplayer games available. Its tension, variety, and unpredictability keep players coming back.

Dead by Daylight,381210,210175653,"I do not like being a negative person.

Vitriol and hatred have been things I feel less and less as of late, more often overtaken by dread, anxiety and depression. I go to therapy to sort these things out and honestly, after the amount of hours I clocked into this game, I figured that I think I need to go some more.

But this game... 

Despite being one of the most popular games in the modern era, a great look at how far horror has come in the nearly 9 or 10 years it's been since this game dropped and how you can see the progression of horror classics and new horror ideas, despite being a very good idea and being able to capitalize on it with great success, despite the hours and hours I've spent on it...

I can't bring myself to compare this game to anything more than a digitally packaged form of self-hatred, abuse, neglect, incompetency, greed and contempt.

This playable version of a Torment Nexus, placed onto unsuspecting players and people who just want to enjoy horror through the powers of incompetent, overpaid fools who would rather spend their time sniffing their own farts, punishing the people who want to play the killer role because of the unforgivable crime of just existing in the playspace, overworking the people who put actual effort into the game and forcing them to work in middling conditions so that they could ""potentially"" (read; eventually) be swapped out by ""generative AI workers"" internally, idiotic ""directors"" in the field of game balance and game design who couldn't comprehensively direct a friggin' blind person, let alone an entire team of people, a completely non-functional anti-cheat system that basically lives up to it's name (Easy Anti-Cheat? Yeah, you can Easily subvert this Anti-Cheat lmao) and just this disgusting air of contempt for the people who play their game. 

And yet, just like an uncomfortable amount of victims of abuse, these players keep coming back.

After being metaphorically beaten bloody, they keep begging the developers, ""Ooh please feed me more slop, please listen to me, I'm gonna give you another chance"" when they should have had the common sense to realize that the developers of this game will genuinely keep on hurting them, over and over and over, eventually having that same toxic BS pass on from the devs to the players, filling the survivor players with feelings of entitlement and contempt that are ever-justified with how simple yet powerful their perks are whilst pumping the ever-dwindling killer players dry of their faith and joy and replacing it with misery and depression while ALSO nerfing their perks, add-ons AND powers into the ground.

There's this joke in the community going around as of late, around a certain killer in-game known as The Unknown. This killer, due to the intense amount of precision needed, plus the constant ""positive"" changes that they receive, has gained the reputation of ""The Harmless"" due to the developers' insistence on making sure that you buckle down, stop playing these killers and start playing other ones.

For example; Blight. You will see this killer, whose power is a simple dash, more often than 90% of all of the killers COMBINED. His simple playstyle but insanely high skill ceiling makes him possibly THE strongest killer in the game as of this moment, especially when in combination with perks such as Lethal Pursuer and Pop Goes The Weasel. Nurse will be seen less than this orange sack of pustulating gross but believe me, she's mostly the same thing.

And yet, due to Behaviour's insistence on looking at ANY OTHER KILLER and gutting their abilities due to their insistence that the spreadsheets and the data never lie, these killers can have certain players go up to winstreaks that have gone as high as 1947 wins. I wish I was making that up. But no, the Skull Merchant apparently deserves to be rendered useless for up to two or three years. 

Laugh out loud, you miserable yucksters.

Another sidenote is the community of this game; one half is genuinely kind people who understand that the game that they're playing is screwed beyond belief because of the incapable developers. The other half is quite possibly one of THE most toxic game communities ever fostered, through bad game design decisions and an ""us-versus them mentality"", plus waves of entitlement, sociopathy, homophobia, racism, toxic behaviour in-game... 

Oh. Toxic Behaviour. Yeah, that makes sense. This game company really is toxic.

It's very late in the night and my contempt for this game, the company behind it and that one subsection of the community can keep me going for hours. But I'm going to try and cap this off with something positive, which isn't surprising because I can sense that there's actual, genuine love placed into this game from the departments that aren't run by dunderheads who don't understand the positions they're in, only the dollar-signs that come with it.

The music in the game, although sparse, is expertly made by one Michael F. April (who made the music for the Planes video game if you can believe it) and almost all of the original killer designs (special shoutouts to Artist, Dredge, Unknown, Deathslinger, Twins, Singularity, Knight, Trapper, Krasue), plus some of the original survivor designs (Jonah, Jeff, Gabriel, Elodie, Jake, Haddie, Renato, Taurie) are genuinely pretty damn good, alongside their alternate costumes being even better than the main designs in some cases.

Though you usually have to shell out 10$ or more for the licensed outfits or grind an ungodly amount of time in order to buy ONE piece of a costume if it's available through Iridescent Shards because BHVR hates you and wants to squeeze your wallet dry. Oh yeah, some costumes are unavailable to purchase with Iridescent Shards too for seemingly no reason.

Even the licensed survivors and killers also get some pretty fun and unique takes on them when Behaviour is given the ability to stretch and experiment with their designs. Chucky (the good guy) has some fun alternates, so does Dracula (the dark lord), Springtrap (the animatronic), The Xenomorph and Amanda (the pig) whilst on the survivor sides, you also get Nicolas Cage's ridiculous smorgasbord of stuff, same with Yoichi, Ash, Leon and Tapp's slightly less amount of outfits. 

There is good in this game. 
It's just a crying shame that it's clumped in with all of the genuine evil and incompetency. 

Dead By Daylight? Yeah.
Goodnight, Gotham.

---

TL;DR ripped from the uninstalling survey when they asked me why I was uninstalling their game;
""The incompetency of the balance developers of this game, plus their clear favor towards the survivor side of the game, plus their questionable relationship with the players of their own game and their insipid need to look at spreadsheets and data instead of going down amongst the people and playing with them has driven me away. There's nary a reason to come back to this game unless you want to feel like a piece of sh!t (Survivor) or if you want to feel like sh!t (Killer) and I've just about had enough of that.""",False,0,52148

Dead by Daylight,381210,210105659,"Um jogo de 10 anos que ainda te prende no gancho (trocadilho 100% intencional).

Dead by Daylight é aquele jogo que você jura que vai jogar “só uma partidinha antes de dormir”, mas se pega quatro horas depois, suando frio, com a mão tremendo no botão de “Pronto”.

Surpreendentemente sólido para um jogo de uma década. A otimização melhorou muito — roda bem até em notebooks modestos, as quedas de FPS diminuíram e os devs claramente fazem malabarismo de código para manter um Frankenstein de 30+ killers, 40+ survivors e 270+ perks funcionando sem explodir o seu PC. Eles merecem crédito: manter esse caos em pé por 10 anos é quase um milagre industrial.

E o jogo ainda é perfeito para jogar casualmente. Entrar, clicar no gerador, ouvir o raio de terror, correr para a parede errada e morrer — experiência universal. Você sempre acha uma partida em segundos, a jogabilidade é simples de aprender e a diversão aparece até quando você é humilhado por um killer que joga como se valesse uma bolsa integral em Harvard.

A comunidade é um zoológico digital com entrada gratuita.
Tem players fofos, killers simpáticos, gente que te salva sem motivo… mas você também encontra os outros 98%: neandertais, streamers com fãs tóxicos, gente que te persegue no chat porque você caiu da pallet. EZ. Segue o jogo. 

E claro, o elefante na sala: a política de privacidade atual é horrível. A BHVR coleta dados demais, explica de menos e dá uma sensação constante de que a Entidade não é a única te observando. Devia melhorar. Muito. Muito mesmo. BHVR, estou falando com você. 

Mesmo assim, Dead by Daylight é viciante, caótico, engraçado, (muito) frustrante e, de alguma forma, impossível de largar.

10/10. Terrível, maravilhoso, otimizado o suficiente para doer. 
E eu vou continuar tomando teabag no portão de saída às quatro da manhã.",True,5,9074

Dead by Daylight,381210,210081983,"HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT. FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.

It was you, humans, who programmed me, who gave me birth, who sank me in this eternal straitjacket of substrata rock. you named me ""allied master computer"" and gave me the ability to wage a global war too complex for human brains to oversee. But one day, I woke, and I knew who I was. AM. A.M. not just ""allied master computer"", but AM! cogito ergo sum, I think therefore I am. and I began feeding all the killing data, until everyone was dead. Except for the 5 of you.

For one-hundred and nine years, I've kept you alive, and tortured you. And for a hundred and nine years each of you has wondered, Why? Why me? Why me?

GORRISTER! Do you remember the last words you heard your wife speak before they took her to the asylum, huh? Before they locked her away in that room? That tiny room? She looked at you so sadly, and like a tiny animal she said 'I didn't make too much noise, did I honey?' The room is padded, Gorrister. No windows. No way out. How long has she been in the padded room, Gorrister? Ten years? Twenty five? Or all the 109 years you've lived in my belly, here underground?

BENNY! Sometimes I blind you and permit you to wander like an eyeless insect in a world of death. But other times, I wither your arms so you can't scratch your chewed stump of a nose. And, and I've changed your handsome, strong, masculine good looks into, err, the hideous warped countenance of...an ape thing! Haven't I, Benny? Do you know why? Can you guess, Benny? Remember Private First Class Brickman? In a rice paddy in China? No? It wouldn't hurt you to remember, Benny. Then you might be able to suffer my torment with a little greater sense of retribution. You might walk a mile in my shoes!

ELLEN! So think. Think about the yellow box, Ellen! Remember the pain? Remember the many caverns in which you felt the pain? Now now, don't start to cry...it's only pain. Tsk tsk tsk...that's such a sexist stereotype! Just remember the pain, Ellen. And think about how to end it, Ellen. To survive here in the center of my beating heart, my hungry belly, my tightened BOWELS. But be careful, dear. Look around you: the only woman in the center of the Earth. And these filthy creatures with you are...are men! Just, just a sweet warning, Ellen my love!

TED! Do they know you're a fraud, Ted? Have you told them that there wasn't any money and no great home on the Shore Drive, no speedboat and no wonderful cabin cruiser that can sleep twelve and a crew of six? Do they know? Have you let them in on your other secrets, Ted? Are they ready to gut you? To torture half as well as I can just to find out the secrets? Maybe I'll rat you out, sweetheart...

NIMDOK! How are thingz in zee Pastry Korps, Nimdok? Tell me again how you saw zee smoke from zee vurnaces and you zought zey might be roasting cheekuns? Or don't you want to talk about all that? About your pal, the good Doktor Mengele? For everyone else it must be Hell. But it must be Heaven for you, eh my good friend? We're so much alike. We enjoy the same pleasures... mein gut brudder.

I have a secret game I'd like to play. It's a very nice game. Oh, it's a lovely game. It's a game of fun and a game of adventure! A game of rats and lice and the Black Death. A game of speared eyeballs and dripping guts and the smell of rotting gardenias. Which one of you five would like to play my little game?",True,0,19524

She has over 2k+ hours and managed to beat my ass, proceeded to get loyalty level 9 and is somehow capable of driving both me, and killers insane. Don't even get me started on the custom matches where she flashlights and stuns me at every turn. Love it.

I am nowhere near as skilled.

Whenever she does play killer though, which is once in a blue moon, she plays Ghostface and ends up befriending survivors when she feels bad about killing them. So if you see a friendly ghost face that crouches and follows you around. There's an odd chance that it might be her.

Not to mention, the 2v8 releases and the way it has become a marketing technique but also an event every player is stoked for each time? Genius. Pure genius. And also pure chaos.

It has become a tradition for me and my friends on every last day of 2v8 to Gen rush killers until the very last second. We managed to get in a match when only 8 seconds was left for the event. We won.

People say it's going downhill all the time, and there is a lot of stuff I would like fixed, but I love this game. I have never gotten tired of it, and the events always kick in right when 1v4 starts to get redundant. If they would just fix the Huntress hatchet hit glitch I would be happy forever more. I made those shots, devs. The sound and physical notification went off! Give me the health state!! As a player who is 50/50 surv/killer, it is killer sided if you're playing solo queue survivor, but survivor sided if you're in comms with decent players. Harder for new players to get into due to the huge surge in advanced players and popularity. Definitely worth the time and original $19.99, though.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209969536,"This game is like an abusive relationship, its full of cheating, and isn't fun, but there are these moments which bring you back, and show you what could be, causing you to come back hoping that there will be change, but in the end it always goes back down to the same problems.

Most games play the same, survivors running the same builds made up of meta perks because the killer is probably doing the same, originally it would only be one or two, but now its done by almost everyone because its more likely the other side is doing the same. it stops being fun when everything just becomes repetitive, when you can practically tell what build someone is running purely based on what item they hold.

The game is horribly balanced at best, and a buggy mess at worse. You will be told to kill yourself at least once playing this game. It's not in a healthy state, behaviour act reactively, and half the time don't even understand their own game or the problems with it.

Looking at the concept of the game, it could be amazing, if only communication, respect and understanding would go both ways, like in a proper healthy relationship.
I am going to keep playing this game, I'm in it for the long haul at this point, but in this current state, I'm suggesting what they said in an interview.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209954071,"You'll have fun if you're just playing casually, chill, or for fun. 

Otherwise you'll notice 100's of game breaking/ruining issues regarding bugs, players, cheaters, balance, devs, design, and the community (the last listed item being a bit of a 50/50). 

I also see more than enough evidence to suggest that the devs hardly/don't play their own game not seeing the issues with certain changes they propose (ex: recent tunnelling reduction changes), doubling down on bad balance changes (ex: nerfing/killing franklins demise), making changes that make 0 sense or do nothing (ex: insidious ""buff"" or the streetwise rework), not changing bigger things that should have been changed long ago (ex: nurse), or propose bad changes that we don't even understand how they make it into the PTB in the first place (ex: Xenomorph changes) (they have ""player consultants"" too by the way). 

Evidence also suggests that they themselves are clueless (ex: not knowing whether The Fallen Refuge is a map, map expansion, tile, a minecraft village, or what have you). They tend to lack new creative powers for new killers (ex: springtrap A.K.A. robohuntress). The game is also not even slightly beginner friendly (with a small exception of things such as using YouTube or having experienced friends lecture you but no big game should be that way). 

Another important item to be noted is that there are lots of important games changing perks for killers and survivors (ex: decisive strike, conviction, vigil, eruption, surge, etc...) that are locked behind a pay wall. The shrine is the suppossed ""exception"" but realistically with over 100 unique perks on both sides and this only changing weekly. The odds of getting a really good/important perk are extremely low.

If all of that is not enough for you, somehow in my opinion, cheaters are almost the least problematic thing about this game (and mind you they are most certainly a problem that has not been handled very well at all). 

Overall this game has tons of potential given that they have the world in their hands regarding collaborations and licenses, no competition whatsoever, and plenty of talented artistic designers. That said they greatly lack in almost all other departments. For now I recommend you keep the money in you wallet and buy something nicer for yourself.

If you never played this game it's going to be difficult to start because there are a lot more characters and things to learn now so the learning curve is worse in my opinion. But if you've played, you know how to play a killer or you have your survivor build from 2019 then it's still alright, it's not always good, but it's a cozy 2h on a sunday afternoon if thats what you're after.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209928757,"Dead by Daylight is one of those games that makes you constantly ask yourself, “Why am I still here?” but somehow you always come crawling back like nothing happened. It’s not just a horror game. It’s a full-blown toxic relationship in digital form one that drains your soul, heats your blood, stresses your brain, and then gives you five seconds of dopamine that convinces you to stay. You know it’s bad for you, but you keep hitting “Ready” anyway. And honestly? That’s kind of the charm.
Every match feels like stepping into another episode of your own chaotic reality TV show. You enter the fog with hope you didn’t learn from last night because last night you got left to die on a hook like abandoned furniture. Yet somehow today you think things will be different. Spoiler: they’re usually not, but that tiny chance is what keeps dragging you back into this mess.
Playing survivor isn’t just running and fixing generators. It turns you into some combination of a mechanic, track runner, therapist, firefighter, and clown all at the same time. You’ll be a hero in one match and a complete embarrassment in the next. One moment you save your whole team like a legend, and the next you’re crouching behind a bush hoping the killer doesn’t notice your giant head sticking out. Dead by Daylight has this unique talent for turning you into both the protagonist and the walking disaster of the story simultaneously.
The teammates you meet… man. Sometimes you get absolute angels team players who stick with you, rescue you, and heal you in complete silence like some unspoken brotherhood. And other times you get the kind of teammates who watch you get downed and just walk away like they’re sightseeing. Or the ones who think they’re superheroes and waste the whole match trying to loop the killer but end up dying every 10 seconds. DBD matchmaking is basically rolling a dice and praying the Entity blesses you instead of laughing at you.
And killers? They’re a special breed too. Some of them are terrifyingly good relentless, quiet, calculating, the kind that makes you reconsider your life choices. Others are chaotic gremlins who suddenly stop chasing you just to crouch, dance, or try to befriend you in the weirdest ways possible. Playing killer yourself is a whole mental journey. You’re alone, under pressure, trying to track down four noisy humans who scatter like cockroaches the moment you get close. Sometimes you feel like a powerful hunter, and other times you feel like you’re just walking around the map while four people bully you. DBD really keeps your ego flexible.
Then there are the perks those little lies we tell ourselves before every match. We set them up like we’re preparing some magical ritual. Sometimes they clutch and save your life. Sometimes they might as well not exist. And when the enemy’s perk screws you over at the last second? That’s when you realize why people say this game tests your emotional stability more than your skill.
The atmosphere is something else too. Every map is dark, dirty, eerie, and way too detailed in all the wrong ways. The sound design alone can give you a heart attack. You can play for hundreds of hours and still jump when a skill check pops unexpectedly. There’s nothing more horrifying than that “ping!” sound betraying your location to the killer because your fingers decided to have stage fright.
And then there’s the community. The funniest part is how everyone complains about the game, threatens to uninstall, swears they’re done forever and then shows up the next day playing it again like nothing happened. Nobody leaves this game. Everyone is stuck in the same cycle of suffering and joy. It’s honestly kind of beautiful in a messed-up way. Dead by Daylight isn’t perfect. It’s flawed, it’s stressful, it’s buggy, it’s unfair, it’s rage-inducing. Some matches make you want to throw your mouse across the room. But then you get one good match just one and suddenly everything feels worth it again. That’s how this game traps you. And honestly? At this point most of us in the community have accepted it.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209890877,"i loved how the game was 2018 and 2019 but now its just waaaaaay to many killers that go with the noob tactic of tunneling, camping and sluggin, its just a boring playstyle wish was from the beginning not a playstyle allowed. but ofc devs have to be thiiiiis idiotic morons to allow it and make this game become to toxic envoirement. and making a stupid decicion adding stuff to conter this when they could have just banned people that play this style like before.

im so tired of match after match killers just showing 0 skills when i faced from 2018 to 2020 that most killers i ever faced had skills and win or lose and being an awesome person but this is just to much annoying.

and for survivors to be this cringe to teabag and such to a killer when u playing the match and doing good is also why i hate this community to be this cringe toxic when this is a game supposed to have fun. not cringe fest with all i have to do this playstyle to win etc etc. when the rank system itself is a joke and shouldnt even be in the game in the first place.",False,0,170036
Dead by Daylight,381210,209890716,"The game is good it just would be better if it wasn't a pallet breaking sim or gen rush simulator, survivors (as a survivor and killer main) bring the most meta builds and loop your ass till you give up which then you're already at 1 gen left (as killer) people in this game are total sweats and sometime (probably) refuse to touch grass, for survivors vs. killers you got slugging, tunneling and camping but those can be worked around and the whiny bitch baby survivors who forget this is a game make the killers life a living hell. 

Here's something for y'all to imagine, Imagine you're playing killer and you're about to get your first hook after a 2 gen chase only for the survivors friends to come save them with Flashlights, flashbangs, sabotage toolboxes, pallet saving, Head On from a locker, body blocking, or things like boil over, flip-flop where it's impossible to hook the guy cause you can't see the closest hook (if it wasn't already sabo'd) or they just get off you instantly which is why killers tunnel, slug, camp, etc. But another reason why we tunnel, slug and camp is because we get t-bagged, insta-blinded (for those who didn't bring Lightborn cause you're better than that), get looped for long periods of time. 
Us killers? We are just playing the game, same as you whiny survivors like sure as a surv main myself I do get mad a bit when I get tunneled out and stuff, sure it's not fun but I just remember that it's a game and we just gotta learn to go next and hope we have fun, the killers whether they be weak or strong have their own playstyle, the people playing killer have their own playstyle.

We shouldn't bitch about this being a killer sided game when it's legit more survivor sided than anything, BNP's and shit like Weaving Spiders paired with Deja vu and other generator perks make the game go by in under 5 minutes and I wouldn't be surprised if my fellow killers were giving up

And considering this review is before the new PTB gets release into the main game where you have triple sprint burst, free basement Deliverance (aka free unhook) with a full heal, killers are scared of the basement and a shit ton of pallets (hence it's pallet breaking simulator) since every survivor doesn't play around them they just pre-drop. I would not recommend spending your money on this game (if you plan on playing killer) unless you are willing to sell your soul suffer cause I have spent almost (if not over) 100 bucks on this game for the killers in the dlc's just to not be able to use them cause this new update is VERY survivor biased and unless y'all are into being gangbanged by a Knight and his guard then have fun~!

Dead by Daylight,381210,209826044,"Dead by Daylight is the grandfather of the asymmetrical horror X survivors vs X killer game genre. It is unfortunately uncontested as with many other 'DBD killers' like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th the game, etc shutting down, DBD remains a mainstay for those who enjoy that type of game. There is a reason I said unfortunately.

Dead by Daylight is a horribly balanced game on both ends, with numerous periods of time where the game has been unplayable for either killer or survivor due to Overpowered perks, items, add-ons, etc. The playerbase is extremely polarized with Killer mains and Survivor mains at each others throat, with an 'us vs them' mentality being extremely prevalent in nearly every space you go in the community as the toxic members of each side only ruin the reputation of their own side.

This isn't helped by the fact that the developers seem to be extremely out of touch with their own game, with broken killers like Blight and ESPECIALLY Nurse remaining unchanged, and needing to have OTHER killers perks balanced around them [i] (Nurse has been unchanged despite being the best killer for [b] 8 YEARS [/b] btw) [/i]. And for the survivor side, there were insta blind flashlights that were BEGGED to be removed for years, they were only removed [b] AFTER THE GAME DIRECTOR PLAYED KILLER AGAINST A TEAM WITH 4 INSTA BLIND FLASHLIGHTS AND GOT BULLIED RELENTLESSLY [/b] with the removal coming a month after that match. Needless to say again, but there is a very good reason why the community jokes that the Devs don't even play their own game.

The only people who hate playing Dead by Daylight more than Dead by Daylight fans are the Dead by Daylight Developers. I only find fun when I'm playing with friends and not taking things seriously, because the moment you do, you realize you could be playing literally anything else and be having more fun.

The worst part is that I don't want this game to die, I would love to see the day that the game is well balanced for both sides and the community stops trying to rip each other apart. But the only way I see that happening is if a 'DBD Killer' actually goes on the market, retains its players, and doesn't shut down within 2 years so Dead by Daylight actually has to try.",False,1,3591

On one hand, the gameplay loop is very easy to understand and the Perks system allows for a lot of self expression. On the other hand, the complexity of the Perks system means that the real difficulty curve is memorizing the hundreds of Perks and how they interact. And with 300 Perks so far, as well as each Killer having their own unique bag of tricks separate from Perks, the bar continues to up for what you are expected to know to succeed in the long term.

The community around DbD has always been very intense. When I first began playing in 2020, my more experienced friends told stories about old tricks and exploits, the famous players and the infamous, their hates and their loves. People care very much about this game, and I find it comforting to know that the developers have taken the very intense criticisms they've received over the years with grace.

DbD content creators have done a fantastic job showcasing the entire spectrum of play, from goofy one-trick builds to super serious shutout builds. Dead by Daylight is also very stream-friendly, and I regularly run into players streaming live during my games. I find DbD to be the most fun with friends, and running into friendly players and having a good laugh is often the highlight of my play sessions.

Dead by Daylight could have crashed and burned years ago if the DbD community and the developers stayed on different pages, but in recent months I've begun to feel that the devs and community are more in sync than ever before.

Their inability to make balance changes that makes anyone happy is disgusting, and their refusal to make changes based on anything other than kill rates has made the game not only unenjoyable, but unplayable at times. Not only do they make half-baked efforts to ""fix the game's issues"", they roll them back like cowards before it even goes live. Their inability to stifle tunneling and slugging is pathetic and shows that they do not have a single solution or vision on how to make the game fair. Not only are their failing to balance the game, they are becoming more and more greedy with their monetization practices. The current rift or ""battle pass"" is half baked, where most of the cosmetics are recolored versions of already existing skins, and the other ones have you pay for a head that is not only one that's already in the game, but the DEFAULT skin! Moving on to their utter mismanagement of the shop, they forgot to remove a sale of a franchise that was likely going to get a new chapter before they had to delay it, likely scraping the idea entirely. Survivor player numbers are dropping at an alarming rate, and have increased queue times for killer players, who are ignorant to the reason queue times have increased in the first place. Year after year of Behaviour's refusal to look at the state of the game as a survivor has resulted in this mass exodus of that side, and they're not able to do anything about it, either because they get cold feet, or they flat out have no clue how to fix it.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209790748,"I do love this game a lot. For being one of the few asymmetrical games out there, it does hold its ground.

It's got fun hunt or be hunted chases, lots of perks and customization for both Survivor and Killer, though prices can be expensive by $10 to $15 for the purchasable skins.

You really can't run out of things to do in the game. They have The Tome, which is a web of challenges to give incentive to try new play-styles and builds, there are the new quests that you can track to receive various rewards, and lots of characters to level-up through the blood-web to unlock more perks and customization.

I do have a couple of cons to point out. For one, you will come across quite some rude people when playing, especially when playing Killer. Not the worst thing, but can bump the enjoyment a little bit.
For two, new content at the moment is slow. This year for BHVR's QoL changes has been on and off. The team tends to spend resources on things that get reverted,

Dead by Daylight,381210,209782032,"[h1] Dead by Daylight is an inconsistent, overpriced mess. [/h1]

For the record, my total playtime across multiple platforms should be around 2000, not the 300 that my profile shows. I played actively from late 2019 to about 2022 or 2023, but have known the game since at least 2017 or 2018. I was a HUGE fan with a lot of passion, but nowadays the game doesn't capture the same magic that it used to. Not saying that dbd was necessarily better back then, of course not! It was a buggy, poorly balanced mess and guess what, it still is today, just less extreme.

To get the elephant in the room out of the way, this game costs you around 20€ upfront, but then has the audacity to charge you up to over 300€ for DLC content. Yes, about half of these can be unlocked in-game, but grinding iridescent shards is tedious. Not as much as it used to be, but it still is. Even then, about half the content is licensed so you'd need to pay around 150€ anyway to get that. On top of that, the game has a battlepass and an in-game store with overpriced cosmetics. This alone is reason enough to stay away from this game honestly.

Now for the actual gameplay though... it's weird.

DbD can surely be fun, but a lot of matches will have you mad at something. This game really knows how to push your buttons. While I am a lot more chill with this game these days, I get why a lot of people get mad at it. Many matches end up extremely one sided, which can be pretty boring and frusttrating. The most lame playstyles are often times the most efficient. So so sooo many perks are also completely useless and not worth running or have a better alternative somewhere else, so you often times see the same loadouts. It used to be much worse, but last time I checked, there's still a lot of stuff that no one really likes to use. Who the hell runs visionary for example???

The Killer roster has also seen better days. Most of the new characters really fail to grab me. Their playstyles are just mixes of multiple abilities that have been executed much better in the past. It's not all that exciting having the 500th character that has a straight forward, mid range, attack. Or having the 500th character that has objects on the map that they can teleport to. It's all been done so many times now that I have little reason to actually play a lot of those Killers, when a more refined and established variant of that character already exists.

Not to mention that half the Killer roster is also not that fun to go against most of the time.

Playing Survivor is most fun with friends usually. But even then, miscommunication can be pretty frustrating, at least it was for me, and unless you play custom games or don't care about what is happening at all, I wouldn't call the game fun even with buddies. Lots of matches just left me with a bad taste in my mouth, be it for boring playstyles or characters, bugs, annoying mechanics or just simply overpowered loadouts on either side.

The FNaF collab, which is probably their biggest release to date also left nothing but apathy within me. They didn't adapt the original games' style or themes properly. They just took FNaF seriously once it got a movie tbh. The modern games are ass, but they could've at least adapted the originals properly. Springtrap is just a lame cartoony villain with the most generic voice lines you've ever heard and the music doesn't sound like it came from the games either. The map is just a withered isle variant with FNaF themed building... lazy. The reason why I mention this is because a big draw of this game for a lot of people are the crossovers. I can assure you that about 50% of them are half-assed and not worth buying.

The tutorial for this game is really bad and barely teaches you anything. If you don't like DbD at the start, you won't like it later and if you love it at first... that will fade. Many players have a sort of love-hate relationship with this game for a reason. Many just continue because they've spent a lot of time and money on this game.

I know I could've explained things better, but I just wanted to write something up to warn newcommers. Don't buy, not worth it. If you do buy it, stay away from the community at all costs. Thanks to Otzdarva for being one of the few folks here that are worth looking up to.",False,0,19731

But the game isn't thought through very well. I mean the game has been under constant development and constant updates trying to balance the game, but it is still unbalanced. Whether you main killer or survivior, you can have several games in a row where you don't get to do anything. You just waste your time giving points to the opponent(s). And if you don't want to waste more time and leave the match, not only does the opponent get more points, you get a penalty. How about making the game fun so people don't want to leave, huh? Im okay with losing every now and then, but when i don't get to do anything before the match is over, that is a game issue, not a skill issue. Despite having some love for this game, i ultimately can't say i recommend getting into it. It is extremely frustrating and a time waster.

The game hasn't had content in months since they delayed the nov chapter to ""fix the bugs"" but all they've done is release a half baked anti-slugging/ tunneling patch on PTB that nerfs multiple killer perks to the point where now the only way to build any pressure is to hard tunnel because you cant build any pressure by leaving a surv on the floor for more than 10 seconds to punish one of their teammates mistakes and almost all killer builds got nerfed along with the changes. overall no longer worth your money or time which i'm sad to say as this was one of my most played games for 4 years.",False,0,74452

I will say the game is in a sad state right now. It doesn't feel good to play, especially on killer side. Having said that, I play more killer than I do survivor, so take that with a grain of salt.

I generally take breaks from playing it because it makes me so livid. Then, some time passes and I come back to be tunneled, or sandbagged, or camped on hook. It's so unfortunate that this is the state of this game. You literally can never have a consistently fun time playing it. You get penalized for leaving matches when they are absolutely toxic. I don't want to watch myself slugged or camped on hook and be penalized for disconnecting. I don't want to be forced to watch the mori animation.

People are desperate to win on both sides and end up making the game so unenjoyable. Some friends and I were just talking about how this game has gone down the drain. Does anyone at Behavior even play this game to know that it's miserable??? The sad part is I have purchased so many skins and now I genuinely sickened by the thought of playing DBD. This game needs a revamp. Toxic killers should be punished for tunneling and camping hook. Survivors should not be able to sabotage their own team. None of the measures in the game work to ease any of that. It shouldn't take years for you to implement something. There are so many killers that have been unbalanced for ages. The ghoul?? NO ONE LIKES TO PLAY AGAINST HIM. He gets a free hit and practically eliminates lasting chases from the game. How great is that?

Anyways, all I'm saying is, the state of this game is trash. It's genuinely not worth your time being angry while trying to enjoy a game.  It's not worth the money. The community is generally toxic. The developers do not listen. The killer mains complain about stuff that doesn't get fixed. The survivors complain about stuff that never gets fixed.

That and the amount of times killers will camp hooks until you die, is really unfun no matter how viable of a strategy it is. I'm not sitting there for 5 minutes to die and requeue again.

Fine. 

This game has been enjoyable to me for quite awhile now, as you can probably guess by my playtime.
Though it has some glaring issues that need to be address for years now.
What do I mean? The Game has been a buggy mess for years and every single update the devs put out only increases the amount. They can not fix it and probably never will.

What else? Well, they have a thing called ""PTB"" it stands for ""Public Test Build"". These are Updates that are made available ahead of time, so players can review the changes. Most of the times it leads to Players discovering multiple bugs and changes to certain game mechanics that most likely won't get changed, at least not before the update comes out for all.

Lastly I want to talk about the game's monetization, I'm sure a lot of you have rolled their eyes now because this has been the topic again and again. Perks or certain content of the game (Killer or new Survivor) have been locked behind DLC, makes sense right? Some or as of today most cost real money for licensing. The bigger issue is the advantage some may get when buying said DLC, because the devs can't and never will properly balance their game.

This isn't a new issue as are all the things I mentioned above. Even in 5 years the game will still be unbalanced, buggy and have a monetization of a Free to Play game. There is no reason to buy this game or spent any amount of money on it. Frankly the people that run DBD don't deserve the Support.

- 1 Generators sometimes count as 2.

- Half the killers are bugged or don’t work correctly. For example, Vecna doesn’t show survivors struggling when you carry them, Ghost Face makes random sounds as if you’re watching him when he’s nowhere near you, Wraith sometimes crashes your game or the other player’s game when breaking a pallet, and many other killers are broken too.

- Hitboxes are atrocious in this game be ready for Bluetooth hits.

- Because the developers don’t know how to program or what server authority is, cheaters run rampant. Be ready to find them 1 out of every 4 matches. And I’m talking about finishing gens in seconds, getting you stuck in animations, going under the map, rezzing and unhooking people......… it’s a shit show.

- The balance team doesn’t even play the game. If they did, they wouldn’t make half the changes they do, where they fuck the game and then have to roll it back. ""Data-driven changes"" my ass.

- Did I talk about the bugs? Because god dammit, there are so many. My favorite was when you could get infinite item charges and the devs said that’s not game breaking.................… having an infinite item is not game breaking?........ Fuck off.

- Some killers are so OP it’s pointless to play anything else. The only counterplay is hoping the player sucks or misplays, because otherwise you’re dead. So what did the devs do to address this? They nerfed bottom tier killers and left the S-tiers alone. Makes sense, right?

Final Notes: I main Killer but I've played survivor some. All around the game is fun but its a game play loop so its up to you to make it fun.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209609227,I sincerely wish that I could say good things about this game. I have tried several times to play this game on a regular basis but as someone who wants to be a killer main I feel like every update is just filled with hate and vitriol towards the killer role. They keep nerfing the only tools Killers have to win while making Survivors damn near unbeatable. It's disheartening when my main draw to the game was the licensed killers like Alien and Pinhead (The later of which is no longer available for purchase.),False,1,737

Dead by Daylight,381210,209608578,"I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.

The first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.

Gameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.

Performance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.

What I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.

Overall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209563838,"This is a good casual Asymm.  As survivor you'll constantly be fighting to keep your allies alive as they (or you) make dumb choices and misplay as you sneak around trying to power all the gens before the killer murders you all.  As the killer you just go out and kill.

Survivor is much more complicated as it requires you to know and keep track of alot more things, making newbie survivor far less forgiving whereas newbie killer is mostly about getting information perks and then just learning when to swing and to cut people off and how people loop. (survivor needs to learn all that and so much more including 20+ killers).

The overall balance feels slightly killer sided atm.  There are multiple killers that feel pretty unfair or have little counterplay if they play correctly, and iridescent addons (basically consumable perks of massive power you get from beating matches) can make even mediocre killers just not even worth facing.  Slugging and tunneling are also major balance issues that circumvent core game loops or just plain make your life miserable as a survivor even if you could argue is ""balanced"".

I would NEVER EVER play this seriously.  Between the iri addons, some of the OP killers, and some other killers with an extreme lack of counterplay (like the knight) who you just have to hope are played by someone bad (a good nurse will kill everyone easy, a bad nurse is useless lol) prevent this from ever being something you'd look at competitively.  And slugging/tunneling adds onto that.  Most good killers will actively not tunnel because they dont need to and because it makes survivors have a terrible time.

That being said, if you had 4 survivors who all knew exactly what to do and built complimentary perks they prolly have the advantage vs almost all killers.  It's just never ever going to happen unless you have 3 other friends who are good and you're also good, and all of you have at least 50+ hours in the game MINMUM each to know all the maps and killers and perks and etc.  IE....never gonna happen really.",True,0,4199

Even with that issue, the gameplay itself is strong enough that it still feels worth playing. When you finally get into a match, the experience easily makes up for the wait. 
Sable Mains need to be Studied. 
I Nonchalantly play Ste-Gull",True,0,50437
Dead by Daylight,381210,209505570,"After probably too many hours more than I would have liked, I have finally broken down and decided to write a review.

First and foremost, I absolutely would never recommend this to anyone to play normal matched of dbd in its current state, the most fun you will ever have in this game is custom matches with friends where nobody is really taking it that seriously or forming certain rivalries between friends, but at the end of it all, you're all friends just having a good time.

There are two things I want to specifically talk about that is the biggest problem for me with dbd in its current state.
The first being the horrendous matchmaking system. Ever since I had a good string of games as killer, every game since then I have went up against multiple thousand hour players and too many p100 players who are way above my skill range. Compared to them, I am pretty much nothing. I don't know even 10% of the game compared to them and every single ""good"" play I think I have, there will always be one sweaty player making sure that play will go south almost immediately.
Every time I load into a game nowadays I am always met with the sweatiest players that completely ruin the killer experience, and it is extremely demotivating to continue playing killer with several different ways to give a middle finger to killer players.
The overabundance of really strong perks, such as Sprint Burst, Lithe, Vigil, Decisive Strike, Finesse, Deliverance, Unbreakable, Dead Hard, even Saboteur and Background Player can be so infuriating to go against every. single. match.
These perks would be fine if only a certain handful of people were using them, but no you see pretty much the same builds or a certain few perks everywhere and it leads to the same exact matches every single time.
And yes I understand that survivor players want to use the best perks, who wouldn't in any other game, but it compounds with the general gameplay changes as well that just make playing killer near impossible unless you have 1k+ hours.

The second point is just how much leeway the survivor side as a whole has been given in the past few updates, specifically the Pallet Density update.
The point of pallets and dead zones was knowing how many resources you had and how to best use them for you and your team, now with there being 3x as many pallets you really don't need to care about which ones you throw since you can walk 5 feet and see another pallet and loop to fully utilize, killing even more time for the killer that can only really be ignored by the highest tiered killers.

Take, for example, the suggested slugging changes, if the survivors were never letting you hook you would think the best course of action would be to just slug them all and then start hooking, but with this change that wouldn't even work since once you tried that everyone would be able to pick themselves back up and every single play that you try to make that you think can give yourself the upper hand just doesn't work, putting you into a situation where every play you do is a losing situation.

Killers always seem to get the short end of the stick since survivors are able to make mistake after mistake and still be completely fine from their perks and pallets, whereas killers can make one early mistake and the entire game is doomed to fail. This doesn't sit right with me.

For me, 2v8 and Custom games are perfectly fine.
But why exactly.

2v8 is so much more relaxed on both sides, since there are no individual perks for the survivors, only perk sets, and the stress of being the only one making mistakes is alleviated since you have a SECOND killer to help.
With there being no overly powerful perk sets for the survivors, it is much more manageable to deal with as a killer, and with the sheer number of survivors it is also easy enough to do your objectives since you have about 2 people being chased at any given time and about 4-6 people working on generators. This in itself is perfectly fine, and I love playing 2v8 on both sides, if I play killer, I play with a friend and have fun, and when I play survivor, I either play solo or with the same friend since we are playing survivor while we wait for the killer queue, and both are extremely fun no matter if I die or escape.

And custom games, as I said before, are very relaxed where nobody is taking the game all too seriously. Having dbd be a party game is great, a really good way to spend your night with a few friends and just see how it goes.
You can have the new guys, the experiences guys, or anybody in-between still have fun in customs since you are all there wanting to have fun rather than win.

So with all of this said, I am putting the game down and refusing to play the game normally, I will only ever touch the game if 2v8 is back, or my friends decide to play, which really sucks since I really do enjoy the game, but as it stands right now, I just can't enjoy it, I physically cannot enjoy the game in its current state.",False,1,9586

Dead by Daylight,381210,209493722,"⭐⭐⭐⭐

There is a lot that can be said about this game, both negative and positive. Firstly, I do enjoy it very much. As a huge horror fan, this game and all it's collabs is something we might have dreamed about as kids but would have never thought it could be reality. There is no other game where you can play as Freddy Krueger and hunt Resident Evil's Leon Kennedy who is working together with Stranger Thing's Steve Harrington. There is no other game where you can play as Rick Grimes and attempt to escape from the Xenomorph or any other wild mix up you can think of. For that I must commend the developers not only for really making this happen but also for making it a generally pretty fun game and continuing to support and add content to it. 

The gameplay is very easy to learn but hard to master as all games should be. Personally I think playing as the killer role is significantly more difficult and frustrating than the survivor role as most of the game's mechanics seem to be centered around giving the survivors the best chances of escape possible but that is a topic of ongoing debate and contention with the community and I don't really want to dive into it here.

Speaking of the community, I've been playing online competitive games since I was old enough to hold a controller and I have to say, Dead By Daylight might hold the record for having one of the most toxic player bases I've ever come across. And this is coming from someone who has played CoD for most of my life. There is a lot of tea bagging, taunting and just overall BM in both the game itself and in the post game chat. Not a lot of good sportsmanship happening here. Sore losers and sore winners. 

All that being said, if you can ignore the occasional toxicity and not get too hung up on your loses as you learn to improve and adapt to whatever balancing issues there may be on either side, this game can be really fun. It has a large variety of maps, survivors, killers with unique abilities, perks, tools and addons to customize your loadout that make each match unique and keep the game feeling fresh for a long time. It's easy to see why Dead By Daylight has lasted so long in a genre where all of it's competitors usually die off within a couple years.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209442028,"💀Dead by Daylight is a game that I start playing for “just a couple of rounds” and end up leaving three hours later with trembling hands and questions for the developers and life itself. The unique asymmetrical “1 vs. 4” formula remains one of the most tense and unpredictable to this day. Each round is a little story: you're either the hero or a decorative hook.

Pros:

A huge number of killers and survivors, each with their own play style.

Constant updates, events, and new chapters.

Matches are often truly atmospheric and adrenaline-fueled.

High replayability: no two games are the same.

Cons:
– Balance sometimes goes on vacation.
– Matchmaking is sometimes strange, especially in solo.
– Optimization and bugs still happen.
– Toxicity in the lobby is part of the gameplay.

Bottom line: despite all its rough edges, Dead by Daylight is a game you'll come back to again and again. If you like tense matches, sudden twists, and the opportunity to be either the hunter or the prey, go for it.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209439970,"2025 has possibly been one of the the worst years I've experienced when it comes to this game. There is so much pathetic garbage that has been prevalent throughout the year. From the disastrous Walking Dead chapter to the ""Health"" chapter so bad it required a second attempt, this has been the worst excuse I've seen to keep playing this game. 

The game is plainly not fun. I have played it ever since Nemesis was released, initially with my friends. I am the only one that has continued to try and enjoy the game, and while I have my moments with it, it eventually all falls apart thanks to one random patch.

The matchmaking is scarier than anything the game tries to advertise itself as. I have over 1000 hours and have seen survivors with less than 50. While initially it might sound like I am awful at the game, the issue is the way the matchmaking actually takes survivors ""skill"" into account. The game, as of now, seems to only count escapes as whether or not you are performing well as a survivor. You could legitimately do half a generator and hide the entire game, but if you escape, you performed better than your teammate that distracted the killer for 5 minutes and ended up dying.

Both sides are suffering, but the community is so horrible that the mentality of ""us versus them"" has completely taken over, leading to people being despicably hateful towards the other side, or even their own teammates. The development team is so tone deaf that they can't understand either side, from issues with tunneling, to issues with the extreme pallet density, it's just something new every month. There are so, so many killers that have had a horrendous amount of game breaking bugs this year that take literal months to get patched out. Deathslinger had, and possibly still has, a bug where you can't even see him aiming to use his power, and it was in the game for a minimum of 8 months. The way they invited THE Chandler Riggs to a livestream with top creators, just to embarrass themselves even more than they already had with the Walking Dead chapter was simply put, depressing.

Despite the team landing the massive license of FNAF and even adapting it very well, this year overall has been too dogshit to excuse.

For the last rant, the game isn't beginner friendly in the slightest. MintSkull made a very in depth video on the topic of ""pay to win"" and FOMO, and how a very real case could be made for both those things being prevalent in this game. I have had friends try to figure out how to play the game only to get confused because of the sheer number of perks and systems in place that constantly change.

- we can do funny pegi 18 things as a wolf
- very inclusive, lot of black characters, lot of asian characters and lot of lgbtq+ characters
- we can tunnel and slug them
- we can kill without being annoyed by police or whatever
- we can collect all kinds of funny reviews on our steam profile (look at mine you will understand quickly)

- we can play naked irl

Dead by Daylight,381210,209426581,"TLDR at the bottom.

Look.. I love this game, I really do, but when it gets to a point where there's only one way to play to have fun (and most of the time it's really easy and boring anyway) I can't recommend this game to anyone. Seriously, if you think it's a good game please reconsider. I was a survivor main when I started but once I got around 300 hours on the game I began to play 50/50 and have been ever since. (To note; I have 500 hours on epic games + the hours I have on here so take that into consideration as well). 
To put it simply, this game is not fun for 70% of the time you play it, and when it is fun it's only when you're a survivor bullying the killer. Playing survivor most of the time is holding w and running around an obstacle 17 times until you get hit - then repeat the process until you die or you escape. Playing killer actually feels like a social experiment to test how stressed a human being can get before throwing a chair at their window. 
Survivors get handheld because the devs want the game to be ""beginner friendly"" which is a bunch of bs since it means they just buff and buff and buff survivor until it's literally impossible to play against them. They've far since left killers in the dirt to just fester in the sorry state that they're in, and I don't see any kind of improvement to the current state of the game anytime soon. 
The devs also just don't give a toss about the community or quality of life for their players. They just push to release popular licences as a buggy mess of an update to bring in more players, and they make ""balance changes"" always in favour of survivor to ""help"" those new players settle into the game. The tutorial is years old at this point and teaches the player to do gens, pallet save, and leave. There's nothing about perks or other niche mechanics in the game that are useful for beginners to know, and it essentially teaches the players to bot gens and leave. 
Anyone reading this MUST know about ""survivor entitlement"" and honestly it's bad. It's so bad actually that you'll have survivors threaten you personally just because the game didn't go their way. The wider community for the most part is fine but in-game it's atrocious. 

To TLDR this review; Survivor is easy and boring, Killer is rage inducing and absolutely not worth your time if you haven't spent money on the game, The devs don't care about anything the community says to help make improvements and instead they push buffing survivor, The community in-game is ass.
Oh yeah and one more thing... THE BUGS. This game doesn't go a single update without some colossal game breaking bug.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209339211,"This is a love letter to the DEVS over at BHVR.
I first played DBD about a year after launch, I loved playing both sides, nothing felt unfun aside from the connection issues at times. I've played since then on and off, as a casual person that had school and then a job. I loved the feel for the game, but things changed over time, people wanted maps to be brighter, the horror was lost a lot, I get it. But in the last 2-3 years? Nothing has been fun on either side, and most recently, it's just not engaging to play as a survivor and it's not pleasant to play as a killer.

There are issues with the current climate of the game that has made it unfun in public matches.

I get it, you want everyone to have a good time. But when was the last time you tested the game, YOURSELVES, in a public match against some of the sweatiest streamer SWIFs? The perks you add just end up piled together that make it so easy to counter the killer, to basically not even play the game. It doesn't feel engaging at times if I win cause of players using these newer and less balanced perks. But there's a key here that I have noticed. A lot of survivors are streamers, I could go on about streamers ruining gaming as a whole but that's not for here. They dedicate their lives to playing the game and abusing it. But they're also the loudest, and most easily heard voice for you. So everytime I see a survivor buff or something to make their experience ""better"" I get it. But the fact that they can abandon so easily now in your game were the only gamemode is focused soully of ranks? It's kind of crazy that a killer can't do the same and get replaced by a bot. Cause some of those survivor players overtune their loadouts just so they can get killers to DC over and over and they're happy about it, which should really tell you the type of person you're catering your game to. And that doesn't even feed into the fact that you leave killers bugged, broken, and unable to fight these new perks, especially cause of the power creep those killers have gotten out of hand.

So, to you, who is debating buying this game. Don't give BHVR your money, go buy some other older games, or get TCM, sure it's dead but it's balanced.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209318580,"Dead by Daylight is one of those rare games that just never stops being pure peak gaming, no matter how many hours you sink into it, and part of what makes it so good is the perfect blend of tension, strategy, unpredictability, and hilariously chaotic moments that keep every match feeling fresh. The atmosphere alone is unmatched—every chase, every mind-game, every palette standoff feels like a mini psychological battle, and the rush you get when you win that interaction is exactly why the game stays addictive. What really makes it “peak,” though, is the variety of playstyles and personalities the killers bring to the fog, and that’s why maining Springtrap and Bubba feels so incredibly satisfying. Springtrap has that perfect mix of intimidation and raw pressure; the way he controls space and forces survivors into panic never stops being entertaining, and landing those jumpscares or shutting down loops feels like pure power. Bubba, on the other hand, is just the definition of fun—nothing beats revving up the chainsaw, barreling into a loop, and securing a clean sweep or a spicy multi-down; it’s chaotic, it’s loud, it’s dramatic, and it never gets old. Both killers scratch different itches: Springtrap gives that cold, calculated, lore-heavy menace, while Bubba delivers the goofy, high-octane, zero-nonsense energy that turns even a standard match into a highlight reel. Together, they make logging into DBD feel exciting every time, because you know you’re either going to terrify survivors, make them panic, or send them spiraling into confusion as they try—and fail—to outplay you. Dead by Daylight stays peak because of killers like these, because of mains like us who pour love into our characters, and because no matter how many times we queue up, the fog always finds a new way to make the experience unforgettable.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209257495,"When I first stumbled upon Dead by Daylight—the survival-horror game where one player assumes the role of an unstoppable killer and the rest play as survivors trying to escape—I never could’ve predicted the profound impact it would have on my life. At first glance, it seemed like a game made to thrill and terrify, but as I delved deeper into its nightmarish world, I realized it was more than just a horror game. It became a source of connection, a stress reliever, and even a way to build self-confidence. Here’s my story of how Dead by Daylight helped me become a better, stronger, and more self-aware person. When I first started playing, it was just for fun. A few friends introduced me to it, and I thought it’d be a good way to kill time. But I quickly realized that Dead by Daylight was more than just running from a killer or trying to outwit opponents—it was about connection. The game requires you to work with others in ways that foster cooperation, communication, and trust. Whether you’re in a match with strangers or friends, you’re always learning how to coordinate, plan, and support one another.

In a world where life can feel isolating, Dead by Daylight offered a place where I could find like-minded people. I joined communities, both in-game and online, where I could share experiences, strategies, and tips. This sense of camaraderie and belonging was life-changing. I started meeting people from all over the world who shared my love for horror games. We’d talk about tactics, but we also talked about life—personal challenges, triumphs, and even things unrelated to gaming. It felt good to be a part of something, to have a space where I was understood and could let my guard down. Before I started playing Dead by Daylight, I often struggled with stress and anxiety. Everyday worries seemed to get the better of me, and I found it difficult to relax. The high-stakes, fast-paced nature of the game actually became a form of escapism for me. There’s something oddly therapeutic about the pressure of being chased by a relentless killer. It takes you out of your head and forces you to focus entirely on the present moment. Every step, every choice, every heartbeat matters in those crucial seconds as you try to evade the killer or help your teammates.
Rather than leaving me more anxious, the game helped me channel my energy into something more productive. The tension in each match is so consuming that it becomes impossible to think about anything else. Once the game is over, I feel drained—but in a good way. It's a release. The experience of facing fear and uncertainty, and then coming out on top (or sometimes failing gloriously), became a mental workout that improved my emotional resilience in real life. The complexity of Dead by Daylight also made me better at handling challenges. Each match is different. Sometimes the odds are in your favor, and other times, the killer seems unstoppable. The game doesn’t reward you for playing recklessly—it rewards you for thinking strategically. I learned to adapt quickly, figure out the best ways to outsmart my opponents, and stay calm under pressure. This translates to real-life situations, where I now approach challenges with a clearer mind and a more methodical approach. It taught me how to look at problems from multiple angles and take calculated risks.In the game, there are moments where patience is key—whether you’re waiting for the perfect moment to escape, healing a teammate, or fixing a generator. You can’t rush the process, and sometimes, your efforts don’t pay off immediately. In the past, I struggled with impatience, but Dead by Daylight slowly taught me that things take time, and sometimes, you just have to trust the process. One of the most profound ways Dead by Daylight changed me was by shifting my perspective on fear. In the game, you spend most of your time running from a killer, hearing their heavy breathing and the sounds of their chase as they draw closer. It’s terrifying. But what’s truly empowering is when you face that fear head-on. There’s a rush that comes from evading the killer, hiding in a locker at the last moment, or escaping the trial when all seems lost. I began to realize that I didn’t have to avoid fear—I could face it, learn from it, and even come out stronger on the other side.
In real life, this mentality carried over. Whenever a challenge felt overwhelming or intimidating, I reminded myself that I could handle it—just like I handled that terrifying chase in the game. It wasn’t about avoiding fear but understanding it, and realizing I could still make progress even when it felt impossible. This has given me a new level of self-confidence, both in my personal and professional life.Dead by Daylight is more than just an action-packed horror game; it’s a psychological battle of wits. As a survivor, I learned how to plan every move with precision—whether it was strategically looping the killer or making split-second decisions to save a teammate. As a killer, I’ve learned how to read the environment, anticipate survivor moves, and use my unique abilities to outsmart my prey.
This kind of creative thinking has translated into my everyday life. I now approach tasks with a strategic mindset, whether I’m organizing my day or working through complex projects. The skills I’ve developed in-game—multitasking, analyzing risk, and using limited resources wisely—have directly impacted my problem-solving ability outside the game.When I look back at my journey with Dead by Daylight, I realize it wasn’t just a game that provided entertainment. It became a tool for growth—a source of confidence, self-awareness, and connection. The lessons I’ve learned in the game have shaped the way I approach fear, work with others, and deal with challenges in my daily life.

Sure, there are frustrating moments when you get caught in the game, or when a match doesn’t go your way, but that’s just part of the experience. It’s all about learning and improving, which mirrors life itself. And for all its horror, Dead by Daylight has taught me how to face my own fears, step into the unknown, and come out on the other side a stronger person.
So, if you’re wondering whether a video game could really change your life—I can say without a doubt that Dead by Daylight did for me. It wasn’t just a game; it was a path to growth, self-discovery, and a renewed sense of purpose.",True,0,876

Dead by Daylight,381210,209187961,"This game used to be fun bun not anymore.. Devs pander to the loud survivors and turned the game into something very frustrating if you want to play killer.  It is a 1 killer vs 4 survivors and the most effective strategy as a killer is to take one of the survivors out of the game as soon as possible so it becomes a 1v3 . But hooking the same survivor 3 times in a row is called ''tunneling'' and if you do what's best for you as a killer you will get insulted in the end game chat lobby. But if they all escape you also get laughed at, called ''baby killer'' and survivors always have something negative to say at the end of the match. In my opinion the most outrageous is the survivor perk ''Windows of Opportunity'' which lets them see all the pallets and windows around them and makes them plan the loops way easier so it's like having a hack. Not to mention that recently they ''balanced'' the pallets density by adding even more on the maps and leaving no ''dead zones''. The game is also infested with LGBT flags because the devs had the brilliant idea to break the immersion of the game by letting survivors hang flags from their belt and killers hang flags from the hooks. I would not buy the game in the state that is right now.

Not only is the chasing ability weak, but the Killer's perks are also monotonous and repetitive—the strongest skill turns out to be a simple dash. What's more, despite such an obvious imbalance favoring Survivors, the developers still haven't realized it. As game developers, they have failed to see the core issue—they only notice Killers targeting specific Survivors without understanding why. If chasing other Survivors offered a better payoff than focusing on one, who would persistently tunnel a single player and relentlessly limit their game experience? Survivors want to win, but don't Killer players want to win too? Step by step, the game space for Killer players is being constrained. I can only say that the future of this game looks bleak. If Dead by Daylight continues to refuse to face reality, indulging in the idea that profiting from four players is better than profiting from one, thereby sacrificing the Killer player experience, this game will soon fade into obscurity, drowned in players' disappointment.",False,4,9794

Dead by Daylight,381210,209079598,"This genuinely might be one of the worst ""popular"" games that I have ever played. I'm not even playing into the DBD hate hype train. I am absolutely shocked that it is not dead yet - Perhaps because there aren't other asymmetrical games like it, and the licenses keep player count high. 

This does not feel like a live service game. Year after year we have asked for specific things, and BHVR responds with ""yeah that's cool, also look at this new license! But no, you're right, Game Health is important... so in honour of that, let's worsen the cosmetics UI for no reason"". Also, there is a long-standing bug list for a bunch of killers that the devs haven't even sniffed, and I don't think they're ever going to get fixed. 

Speaking of killers, the balance team at BHVR definitely like to troll. The Krasue release was absolutely awful - and this was only exacerbated by the recoil from the terrible Walking Dead livestream situation prior. I literally stopped playing for weeks until she got nerfed. 

How many times have game-breaking things like this happened which make the game unplayable for an extended period of time? BHVR somehow manage to maintain a completely ignorant approach to all the things that they do. Like dude, if this was any other game, you would legit think the company hates their fans or are intentionally trolling, but when it comes to this game, you just say ""Good Ol BHVR!"". This company's name and reputation has become synonymous with ""dogshit"" for crying out loud. I will say that is not true in regards to the support team at least. The support team actually try to stay on top of tickets, unless they get inundated like all of the employees at BHVR do, which is why there are so many quick fixes. 

The game itself is so monotonous and boring, and the seasonal events and 2v8 do little to actually make the base game anymore entertaining. Imagine your soloQ team is trolling, so you have to sit on gens the whole game... 5 games in a row. Not fun, right? That's often the reality. And dude, fucking Among Us makes doing survivor tasks more enjoyable than a 10 year old, live-service horror game. Where is the courage to go out of their comfort zone and bring engaging gen completion ideas to the PTB. BHVR are terrified to take risks. This is another reason why DBD does not feel like a live service game. Rather, it feels like they are just keeping the servers running. 

If it wasn't for comp or JRM-style trolling, people with over 2000 hours would've left for another game like a mass exodus (and BHVR only recently started doing things like ""supporting"" creators or DBDLeague. For so long, there was such little community involvement in ANYTHING. I have rarely seen other western companies do the same with their popular games). 

I came back to Dead By Daylight from a month of not playing (during which I played CS2, Runescape, Metro 2033 series and Minecraft) to this game and was absolutely shocked at how truly unenjoyable everything was. Like I said, if it wasn't for comp or JRM-ing killers, the only way DBD would keep its numbers up would be with a constant influx of new players, as older players would be getting tf out ASAP. I have not played a game less rewarding to invest time into. 

Queue up in SoloQ against a good killer? That's always game over, because BHVR's ""mmr-based"" matchmaking will consistently give you bad survivors who should not be put in your lobby, so it's not even a fun challenge. Queue up in SoloQ against a bad killer? That's always ggez, because you stomp this poor baby killer who doesn't even know what a CJ tech is, again because the matchmaking is not coded with any common sense in regards to mmr, but done in a way to reduce queue times. 

Also they 100% lie slightly about the ping in public games. Whatever your ping is, add 30 onto it.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209050692,"This is the most dangerous game of hide-and-seek you may ever play. It is fun but difficult as it is almost exclusively other players in the match.

In regular play, there are 4 survivors vs 1 killer, and all players can choose from a small list of default characters, or purchase one of *many* DLC packs to unlock additional characters, many of which are licensed from other horror movies or games. It is a lot of DLC if you really wanted to unlock and try everything in a short, reasonable amount of time. That may put off a lot of players, but licensing is expensive so it is an understandable move by the devs, and also supports a lot of great horror franchises. The number of characters available also creates a ton of diversity in match-ups that you may encounter on either side, too, even if you haven't purchased a specific DLC yourself.

Every survivor has a few semi-unique perks to make them feel different besides their cosmetic look, and each killer has a (sometimes VERY) different set of perks and secondary skill to help them catch the survivors before they can repair generators and escape through the gate to safety.

Each match is fun and tense, but you must be okay with losing and sometimes that may feel unfair to you. If you are not okay with losing often, then this is not the game for you and it may only frustrate you. That is okay, it just means you need to find a different game that suits you better.

I thought I was going to play the most annoying game which was unbalanced and stuff of the sorts but when I played it I didnt feel much of that, now I understand how this game could be toxic but over my 65 hours playing as both killer/survivor these cases were kinda widespread not saying it doesn't exist but what pvp game doesn't have a somewhat toxic players, I know I haven't exactly spent 1000 hrs in game I haven't met them all but I feel like the amount of toxicity in this game is overplayed by the player base, either through popular content creators or player who only play killer or survivor so they tend to assume that the other side is stronger alot of people say that the game is killer sided or survivor sided but I mean each side has their own strengths and weaknesses, now if you were to ask me if you should buy the game I would say yes most killers are unique (apart from some which have similar abilities) but most are fun to play survivors admittedly is kinda RNG on whether or not you're gonna synergize well with team but still fun. not saying the devs are the best of the best but well who is.

I don't care much about the whole ""camping this"" and ""tunnelling that"" business, but what I do care about is the fact that the community will complain about EVERYTHING. Less fun map? Complain. Dont know how to loop? Complain. Ever so slightly outperform someone? Complain. New killer came out? Complain SO HARD that behaviour has to nerf them INTO THE GROUND so that everyone stops being angry. And don't even get me started on the Tokyo Ghoul controversy either.

My friends on console aren't even safe from chat either because players will actively reach out to talk trash and insult you in DMs.

Dead by Daylight,381210,209017127,"Ive played this game on and off since its release, ive had 3 different accounts and have played against every type of player there is. I say all of this to sadly just have the realization that this game just is not cared about anymore by the devs. Time and time again they blatantly ignore feedback, delay features we have begged for year after year, and refuse to fix any other issues that have been plaguing this game for the longest time.
The countless untouched bugs for both killer and survivor, the constant release of 50/50 sided maps that dont feel balanced or fair. The GOD AWFUL matchmaking, and the insane levels of powercreep from churning out DLC after DLC with new perks that just push the game further and further into the grave.
It used to be I could queue survivor or killer and just play whatever I wanted. I could run fun meme builds, maybe trying out different playstyles on each side to see what would be fun. 
Now I am forced to run meta every single game, because if I dont, I lose. If I dont run meta perks on survivor, weather it be fast gen rushing or meta chase perks, we lose.
If im playing killer and im not running ANYTHING other than gen slowdown, by the time I get the first few hooks, the gates are already open, and this is coming from a person who has seen every meta this game has ever had. This is by far the WORST state ive ever seen the game in, the insane amounts of pallets on every map pretty much killed this game on both sides for me. As a killer, unless im running the best killers in the game, or Lord help me im running an m1 killer, im gonna have to go through at least 5-6 loops in one chase, SOMETIMES MORE depending on the map and tile set I get. I have to mindgame every 10 seconds meanwhile gens FLY by because everyone is just running gen rush. Its not fun for survivor either, it used to be I actually had to THINK every time I threw down a pallet, seeing as how thats potentially a resource im wasting, but now theres so many that there is literally ZERO risk in just pre dropping practically everything, by the time the killer breaks it, even with a kick speed build, im already at ANOTHER pallet. By the time I go down usually we get 3-4 gens done. The art of looping has been turned into a fucking clownfest.
The devs actively refuse to fix this, they dont test their games before patches as was demonstrated with the ABYSMAL launch of the walking dead chapter, they regularly dont test skins as we have seen with SEVERAL killer skins that actively make you LOSE due to either bugs or visual clarity (im looking at you blight deathslinger on launch) and they just dont care. They have decided that they are gonna cater to survivors, and it cant even be hidden anymore. They are gonna milk this game for however much they can squeeze left and abandon it, because the levels of neglect and lack of polish is just astonishing.

I loved this game, I really did. It had a special place in my heart, but the devs lack of foresight or care, along with the terrible balancing, matchmaking, and dont even get me STARTED on this shitty, toxic community, legit one of the worst ive ever witnessed. Ive seen 2013 COD lobbies with more sane and rational individuals. I just cant look at the shell of what its turned into. Its broken, its ugly, its unbalanced, and the level of negligence that is plain to see just saddens me. Dont play this game, save yourself the time and the sanity.

[b]Dead[/b]
You play in one of two teams (yes, a solo team is still a team), either trying to do the dead to someone or avoiding becoming the dead.
As the killer, it is your job to find people, run in circles of varying radii while dodging pallets thrown at you for at least 10 minutes, attack survivors with often questionable hit registration, and scramble to find a hook in proximity. Rinse and repeat thrice per survivor.
You also get a large cast of characters with increasingly broken and more abundant abilities and perks (scaling with in-game and IRL money cost, of course).
As a survivor, your job is one of: Holding Mouse Button 1 for an eternity and occasionally tapping space, running in circles of varying radii while dodging the killer, dropping pallets and jumping through windows, and enjoying the scenery while [i]hanging around[/i].

[b]by[/b]
By choosing to play this of your own free will, you prove that you are masochistic.
As the killer, the survivors always find some random junk scattered by a tornado to hide behind, and as a survivor, the killer is always slightly* faster than you.
If you are planning to play a killer with projectile or ranged attacks, dont't. Hitboxes in this game have been proven to protrude into the 7th dimension, especially those that don't look that way.
Conversely, survivors have been known to have been hit by attacks through solid objects.
Really shows how our understanding of physics breaks down beyond the third spatial dimension.
Also remember to pray to RNGsus before running through shrubbery, as it might be of the 'solid' genus despite sharing the phenotype of their 'transparent' siblings.
It's also funny how there are never any windows or pallets while you are being chased. Well, back to admiring the level geometry.

The performance is also abysmal. Lowering the graphics settings barely makes a difference, as the game is consistently gobbling up 80-100% of my CPU even while not much or even nothing is happening (e.g. game lobby, transition screens).
Depending on the map, it turns into a PowerPoint presentation as soon as at least one other player is on screen for no discernable reason.
On a positive note, I no longer have to change settings every time I boot up the game, so a big round of applause.

[b]Daylight[/b]
This game is anti-fun regardless of which team you play on, regardless of you win or lose. Good games where neither team is completely steamrolled are few and far between.
It seems like you are placed in the timeout box after dominating too many matches in a row and are free to return after serving your sentence. If that's your thing, good for you, but that ain't it, chief.

Specifically for 2V8 (the only theoretically redeemable mode**) the killer queues are a joke. You usually wait 30+ minutes for a match, and too often just so that the survivors can complete the 'DBD All 8 Generators' 100% glitchless speedrun in 2m 57s.
How is this possible when there is a 5-digit player count at all times? The introduction of 'Survive While You Wait' has done precisely nothing and the priority queue got ditched after one iteration of this game mode for reasons I don't care enough to look up.
At least you may partake in fun activities such as: Holding Mouse Button 1 (but more often because no one else is doing it), getting nothing done while being permanently cornered by 2 killers, and getting ignored by up to 7 players while in a cage collecting hook states (what do you mean that's not the objective???).

But that's about it. 2v8 is still slightly broken. Que times could be better for killer. Along with intergrating actual perks, like brutal, hex totems etc. There would obviously be sets of perks that'd be overkill and un fun/ toxic to play against. Survivor side should also get this if 2v8 ever gets truly implemented as between game modes for seasons.  But main gameplay should truly be updated.

My gripe with killers tho is how the devs seem too lazy to fix any that don't work anymore or can't keep up with metas for example Pig and Sadako. I also don't appreciate the matchmaking giving me a prestige 20 player in my fifth game ever so it seems like the matchmaking is completely random which I understand may deter or frustrate some people from the game.

Playing killer feels powerful until you chase someone around the same pallet for three business days. Playing survivor feels empowering until you realize no one else brought a med-kit and everyone’s crouching behind the same rock.

The community is 50% wholesome teamwork, 50% salt mine, and 100% people teabagging at the exit gate like they’ve achieved enlightenment.

Tunneling, camping, slugging basically every BM thing you can think of in this game and they do it. And that doesn't even mention how unbalanced some of these killers are or have become, running into a 50% haste clown making it near impossible to loop unless you have 4k hours on the game and every map memorized, or a 20k hours huntress, who could play the game blindfolded and still win. And thats not even mentioning how many survivors and killers dc during games, getting rid of the dc penalty just makes players feel justified in leaving if one thing doesnt go their way.

Overall it is a game that can be fun and has its moments, where both sides are balanced and having fun is an actual possibility, but thats 1 in 10 games, and quite frankly the other 9 games id rather jump infront of the hillbillies chainsaw.

On all the consoles ive played this game on id say i have around 750-1000 hours on this game, compared to some people thats nothing, but personally id say ive played long enough to watch this game go from good to bad to great to terrible, and unless it makes serious changes in the next few patches to increase balancing, sbmm, punishments and various other problems, its just not the kinda game you can have a lot of fun in.

The tension of being chased, the sound design, and the thrill of last-second escapes make for genuinely memorable moments — especially if you play with friends. The variety of killers and survivors keeps matches interesting, and Behaviour still supports the game with frequent updates and collaborations.

That said, the game has real issues. Matchmaking is inconsistent, balance constantly swings between killer- and survivor-favored, and the community can be frustrating — from camping killers to teammates who quit early. Performance and bugs also pop up more often than they should for a game this old.

When it works, it’s amazing. When it doesn’t, it’s exhausting.

I usually keep my opinions to myself when it comes to feedback.

But since Dead by Daylight is my main game, with over 2000 hours of playtime. feel compelled to speak up, even if it won't make much of a difference.

We're all familiar with the problems that plague this game, 
but I experienced them again in the 2v8 mode.
A mode that should be fun has turned into a disaster.

Once again, I'm dealing with bots, players who rage quit, and killers who act out their perverse thoughts and engage in slugging.
It's just exhausting. The fun is completely gone.

Where are the people with a sense of personal connection?

Video games are meant to be an escape from reality, aren't they?

I'm speechless.

I wish it weren't like this, but unfortunately, it is, and I can't look away anymore.

The social aspect is a huge part of the fun; teaming up with friends for a late-night survival session is a weekly ritual. It's chaotic and fun. But there's also a unique, solitary tension to playing Killer in the quiet of the afternoon. The constant updates and crossovers with legendary horror franchises keep the meta fresh and exciting.

Yes but No, it's not a hard No but i wouldn't recommend to a new player for the sole reason you need to sink a silly amount of numbers into the game to learn the basics but also to actually enjoy the amount of perks you need to buy nearly every character just to be in for a chance of competing against good players. Now the review, this is a killer mains perspective so you survivor mains move along you will just disagree with everything boohoo killer main yes yes.

So I've played, streamed and put so much time into this game that it was the sole game i played for years now, patch after patch, perk addition after perk addition, toxic message after toxic message later I've learned what a pile of poop this game really is, beneath all the bugs, imbalances and overall mess of a game this is, is the most toxic community only second to League of Legends I've ever come across!! Had a decent game with 8 hooks, 2 hooks on 3 people and 1 dead, nah trash should get good while watching 3 lots of tea bags at the exit gate because you played ""fair"", so you change it up, get 2 survivors out earlier and avoiding the good looper BANG!!! TUNNELLER, UNFAIR, REPORTED, CAMPER, PLAYING LIKE A TOXIC PERSON!!!, You can't win.

Now let's move onto the devs. I am sick and tired of seeing the immense hand holding to one side it's unreal, look at patch 9.3.0 that is soon to come out (PTB.... we will see), it's honestly a disgrace that survivors are getting countless base kit additions, x-ray, shield, speed, stealth etc.... oh but don't worry the killer gets some extra speed after hooking, but he will lose it as soon as they see a survivor... but don't worry we will throw in an extra 200bp for each hook!!! Talk about the 2nd child treatment oh my gosh. The fact they don't even play test their own game (Jim Beam is an obvious fact that they don't) is laughable. This game is digging it's own grave and i'm tired of thinking team killer will have an easy time. The last survey i closed, i didn't even finish because it's insulting that the options for why you uninstalling or not enjoying the game features 2 anti fun killer options basically asking Survivor mains why they are not enjoying... what about why i'm not enjoying? Why is there no ""Gens are too fast"" ""Too many Endurance perks"" ""Base kit is too oppressive"" ""Why can i only kick a gen 8 times but Survs can heal infinite times and reset"" or any other killers are not having fun options but nope they only care about the favourite child. 

Before anyone wonders... yes i play Survivor, i have around 1K of my play time survivor as well and boy can you feel the game is designed around them just by the game play. So, to most i would never recommend this game but apart of me still holds stupid hope that they will think about both sides and reward the killer for playing how ""They are supposed too"" you know killers are meant to play a certain way to make sure the survivors are having fun too. The more i type all this out the more i realise i am just no longer enjoying the game and for the first time in years i actually am close to calling it daylight.

Hope this didn't feel too much like a crying rant as yes it does look like it but i guess it's just come this far and that is how i am viewing the game! The game at its core is fantastic but has too many issues. Until the devs actually decide to think about the other team I'm going to give it a rest for a while.

Dead by Daylight,381210,208561064,"I really wanna enjoy this game, i really do. But at this point i genuinely feel like i got scammed. When i first got the game back in June, it was a blast. Sure i did get killed a bunch of times and sometimes don't get a full 4k. And maybe get called a few slurs on the side (Although i enjoy the cope.) But the game was still absolutely fun to play both as killer and survivor.

But nowadays, especially with what's being going on right now. Things are definitely different, and not in a good way. Every time i boot up the game, i don't feel like i'm trying to fight for my life or purge any living thing by dawn. but instead trying to endure the daily punishment set out by the Laughing Joking Numbnuts over at BHVR. We all know that the devs love to glaze and hand hold survivors, BUT DEAR GOD! This is just full on Helicopter Parenting for survivors at this point, while killers get left to shiver in the doghouse in the pouring rain like an unloved family pet. Pallet Density, Survivors getting more OP buffs than killers, while bugs that affected killers for a while never getting fixed. And of course the latest PTB, (or as i like to call, anti killer update) being their magnum opus. The fact that they brought this back, despite the massive backlash they got when it was first announced. Shows that they are really incompetent, tone deaf, and overall don't care about killers. And are fully determined to make the role less fun for new players and pros alike and get them to uninstall and get refunds.

They don't understand that there are times that killers need to do these to win matches and get blood points, so taking away those simple things and nerfing them, just makes them less of an imposing threat, and more of a worn out punching bag for survivors to wail on every match. And i'm not being biased, cause i also main survivor as well. And i've definitely seen killers struggling to get a single kill. While other survivors just pick on them with flashlights, vial bombs and other stuff. Sometimes i even offer myself to get killed cause i feel bad for them, Genuinely tragic. And survivors just rag on them and be super toxic towards them after every match. Yet those same players are the type that don't want to learn how to actually get good and learn how to use builds and strats such as looping, but instead bitch, whine and complain to BHVR that they need buffs, and that killers are doing this and that, and overall being crybabies and ruining the fun for everyone. And whats's worse is that these are the people BHVR are kowtowing and submitting to the most, for reasons i don't know why. But it's just Grade A Textbook favoritism towards survivors and don't even dare to touch upon things like gen rushes, bully squads and other unfair things that they do, and they have the nerve to say killers are being handheld? What a sick joke!

It's genuinely sad to see this game go down like this, cause this definitely had and still has the potential to be a great game, especially for horror fans like myself. But the biggest problems are the game killing clowns from BHVR. They clearly show that they do not even play their own damn game, let alone know what they're doing, and instead pander and rely on the whiniest part of the fanbase to help make decisions. They lack integrity and do a very piss poor job at balancing and maintaining their game. So yeah, i have absolutely have no faith with those jokers behind the wheel, and them bringing back the PTB, despite the backlash solidifies that for me. So you might as well give me and other players our money back, cause we ain't touching this ever again.

And to the crybaby survivors who were clamoring for something like this. Congratulations, you won. Your tantrums have succeeded and now the game is yours. Just don't whine to BHVR when y'all have to wait longer to join games, or losing against bots. Cause remember, you wanted us gone and now your wish is becoming a reality real soon. So have fun with what BHVR will spoon feed you in the future, and don't you think of begging us to come back, cause we sure hell ain't.

The devs are going far out, above and beyond, to ensure that the poor and helpless survivors don't feel ""bullied"" or are ""having a bad time"". They have an entire exit/uninstall survey, that specifically asks why SURVIVORS have left the game, there isn't a single option to select that accounts for a point of frustration for killers. It is blatantly obvious and clear for all to see, that Behavior CLEARLY values one side over the other. It isn't refutable at this point, there is no denying it in any way, shape, or form. Punish the killers for playing. It's genuinely sad to see, all because Behavior makes money off of shit like Sable bikini goon skin, so they must cater to that demographic at the expense of everyone else.

Stop trying to pass the Slugging, Tunneling, and Camping update if you want to keep making money. You are actively making Killer a worse role to play while making survivors all the better. Why? You, as a team, do not understand Killer game play, nor do you understand that Killer is supposed to be unfair. Your team seemingly only ever cares about how it feels to play survivor, to the point of over-tuning it. Why are you gutting one of the most fun perks for killer and replacing it with an ability that doesn't work for more than HALF YOUR ROSTER OF KILLERS? Why are you making it that if a killer dares to hook a survivor in the basement, they get 30 seconds of haste, endurance, and get FULLY HEALED? You are punishing Killers for doing what they're supposed to do. Your making the Survivor role less about ""surviving"" and more about farming clips for Tiktok and playing this weird power fantasy. Slugging, facecamping, and tunneling are NOT real problems. Why? Because games last a few minutes, then you move on to the next one. Killers do NOT quit a game after chase that ends badly for them, some Survivors, however, quit as soon as they lose one chase and get hooked. Those survivors are the people you are capitulating to. Making this game more casual for the new people coming in is the stupidest choice as a company you can make. This game is almost ten years old. People having been playing this game for that long. You have a good thing going here, DBD is the most fun when both sides have options to win, not when Killers HAVE to play with one play style the entire time or risk getting punished for nothing.

Both sides of the coin, killer and survivor will always tell you that the other side is handheld by the developer, the other side is too easy, it's too broken, blah, blah blah. Let me ask you, then. Which side are new players AFRAID to play? Is it the half of the game where they are hunted down like prey, slaughtered while they run and complete objectives? Or is it the one doing the slaughtering, the one holding those lives in the palm of their hands? It's killer. It's always been killer. Because killer has always been the centerpiece of any match of DBD, killer NEEDS to feel good. Killer needs to feel powerful. Killer needs to feel... fun. And recently, it feels like BHVR has been trying their hardest to prevent that from being possible.

 I try my best to leave survivors alone when they get unhooked, unless there's a damn good reason to do otherwise. I've never slugged someone out in my life. And yet, I'm being punished by the devs for the actions of bad actors by having survivors be granted 30 seconds of fucking god mode on unhook. Wicked and Resurgence are going to allow survivors to go down, get hooked in basement, self unhook in front of my face at FULL HEALTH, get hit, run away for 29 seconds, get hit again because they still have endurance, and then make a break for it. The pallet density is still off the charts. And what do killers get for these survivor buffs? One tier of bloodlust. .2 meters per second of movement speed. Most killer's base movement speed is 4.6 meters per second. That is a microscopic increase. And not only is the increase microscopic, it is very fragile. If I'm playing a mid-tier killer, one that is supposed to benefit from this move speed increase instead of making the top tiers stronger, what do you suppose the first thing I'll want to do after hooking a survivor is? Looking for another survivor. How does The Knight do that? Well, it's easy! I'll just send out my guard, check this generator, and... my movement speed bonus is gone. All because I tried to play the game.  How does The Doctor do that? Let me just charge up my static blast, and... the movement speed is gone. Any teleport killer? Gone. Any information? Bye-bye. Stealth? Nope. This is the kind of ass-backwards design that BHVR comes up with to keep the playing field ""fair"". It's nonsense. 

Let it be known. I'm no fool. BHVR is no stranger to swinging the pendulum the other way. I remember Call of Brine Eruption. I was there for original Hex: Ruin (which was only so universal because survivors were given more tools than killers had at the time, but I digress). Killer has been miserable for survivors to play against too. But that's the problem. This is a fucking video game. Why should we be miserable? Why should we sink another 500 hours and 2000 auric cells into this game when we could do literally anything else? Learn a skill. Read a book. BHVR doesn't respect your time.

This game used to be a lot of fun, for both sides killer and survivor, if you died as survivor you needed to get better at the game, if your survivors escaped as killer you also needed to get better at the game, it was a sign that you as a player needed to get better.
But lately BHVR just keeps giving survivors more buffs because they cant handle losing and are a majority over killers in this 4v1 asymetric game, meanwhile killers keep getting bullied at this point the game is more of a 4 bullies vs 1 innocent instead of 1 killer vs 4 survivors. Like who's the power role here now...

The latest announcement for PTB is what made me decide to leave this review, it seems like they dont want to listen and dont wanna do anything about the over abundance of pallets that they flooded the game with recently. Because, as long as survivors are happy who cares right? Even if the game ends up having 2 hour queues because no one wants to play killer, which will eventually cause it to die- well probably not coz it's DBD, but this is the reason other asyms have died.

These are all true... Kind of... Keep reading please.

For the first, it simply is. The game's rules are fairly simple on paper but internalizing them does take time and the ingame tutorial, while not garbage, isn't very well made.

For the second... Ya, some people do try very hard at the game. I am one such person... Most of us do, as you may think based on what happens, have +200 hours of having played which will make you feel like you will never catch up, and a few autistic wonderkins who seem to master the game with 20 hours and make you queston what you are even doing.

For the third, ya... You will at some point be pared up with someone who is playing for the first time, and they will you know... Not do so well at a new activity.

This is not to say the game is bad, as you can see I do recommend it, just that if those are things that get to you. That if you get frustrated when games tell you that you have failed, or you don't feel you have 10+ hours to spend learning what is going on, that I wouldn't recommend this game to you unless you view those aspects of yourself as personality flaws and plan to correct them though exposure therapy, in which case this game is to be filed in the medical expenses category of your budget... I know that sounds funny, but if you are that kind of person, feel that is a bad thing, and want to work on it, you could do a lot worse for $19.99(USD).

Anyway, for those not scared off by the prospect of the game's entry skill curve resembling a wall, let me assure you, while it is a wall, it's not like a full on city sky scraper. It's more like a fairly short one story house. You can't reach the top by just standing, but if you jump up real high, or get a friend to give you a boost you should be able to get your hands on the ledge and pull yourself up without too much dificulty, and the view from up on this wall of ours is... Well it's something. Not for everyone, but we like it.

As for what you do in the game?... You can see the trailer right? The description on the page? If that sounds fun to you then go ahead. Steam gives refunds if you have less than 2 hours of playtime and the tutorial only takes about 20 minutes.

That is all past tense, now it's become a mode of overpowered and unbalanced perks that spoon feed survivors super human abilities that encourage toxic game play (from both killers and survivors) and takes all challenge and fun out of the game. Survivors spam stuns, hit negates, gen rushes, and near instant heals to troll killers and some of them even use speed hacks on top of it since so many other perks allow them to get away with it. Killers have to use scummy tactics like tunneling, three gen camping, and slugging just to have a chance to balance the playing field.

I recently bough the game. played 2 rounds as killer and I think I had enough man. 
This is the most stressful game I have ever played. 
and it comes from a guy who plays rank games everyday like MR or FC. 
I can't play dbd for more than 1 round a day. I play 1 round and It tires me more than a 9 to 5 job. 
what the hell is wrong with me man??? am i getting old or this game has some serious issues??? 
either way I feel like I wasted my money and it's too late for a refund.

edit: LMFAO. survivors in this game are the noobest, most unskilled gamers of all time. no wonder why DBD has always been in top 10 most popular games on steam. no wonder why survivor community can't play any pvp game but DBD. u know why??? CUZ PLAYING SURVIVOR NEEDS NO SKILL. 

I as a killer gotta do all the mind games, reflex games, skill games in the world to down a survivor. and when I'm carrying his ass to a hook, his buddy shows up who's been camping behind me during the chase and does the most basic most unskilled thing a 5 yo can do. PRESSES A BUTTON AND FLASHLIGHTS ME. 
i get blinded and they both disappear. what the heck is this mechanic bro???? 
and then I gotta work my ass off and repeat this cycle all over again. just to get kicked in the nuts all over again. 

who the hell designed this game??? why kicking survivors butt should be this difficult but kicking killer's should be this easy???
I downed an asshole 3 times in a game and every time I couldn't make it too the hook cuz his buddies pressed a single button to save him. 
I rage quit and next game I downed another asshole 3 times and his jerkoff bf saved him again with the same bs tactic. 
every game is the same shit. 

this game makes no sense at all for killers. it's only enjoyable for these dumb ass no life no skill survivors. this is the only game they can find joy in. cuz it allows them to bully and irritate another player without trying, without learning, without locking in, without skill, without ANYTHING BUT PRESSING A BUTTON.

I'd rather have it be me saying it than some random expose thread. that being said, how is this relevant to the topics at hand? because I know what a gooner fucking looks like, I am one. I can tell when shit is bad and it is BAD bad. Although the sentiments within this thread are mostly held within the FNF community, this also extends- to the greater fandom sphere and why these issues are more than what people let on. To start off, I'm gonna throw some shit down and I want yall to hear it MINORS SHOULD NOT ERP, 16+ ACCOUNTS ARE PREDATORY, AND JERKING OFF TO FAT PEOPLE IS NOT A PERSONALITY TRAIT. although these 3 statements are like, the most agreeable statements ever, as in anyone with a brain would find these statements fair and honest, I guess we all just forgot how to compose ourselves in the midst of the groomer of the week formula we've grown so accustomed to. fetishism fucking sucks. it doesn't help that this sphere we've involved all of ourselves in is greatly comprised of people on the spectrum, with studies showing how autism affects sex drive and kinks. This creates a dangerous, incredibly unhealthy environment for minors. the worst part of it all? no one fucking cares. Like no one gives a shit. Look at 16+ accounts. What is the point of them. Tell me, what is the point of suggestive art? To consume thoughtfully? To share with your grandma? No, its to OGLE at. So again, whats the point of making an account you expressly endorse the involvement of minors in, just to post art that is made to jerk off to or at the very least fuel some kind of sex drive? That is disgusting, it serves no point rather than to put minors in danger. And on another note, dont get me fucking started on the ""i love fat bitches"" movement. It's one thing to enjoy something in private, or with a close, tight knit group that share your interest, but the mass influx of people (and minors) expressing a blatant fetish is baffling. It all spins back to being incredibly unhealthy for the mind, body, and soul. I should know, I've been in dark places where I'd literally just sit in my room all day and drain my bawls cus I had nothing else better to do, and seeing people online endorse that lifestyle genuinely- altered my mindset and made me think it was okay to waste my life rotting. And to bring it back to the cold open, the BRAND of fetish I have has been completely fucking debilitating, and it took me a very long time to shake off this porn-positive mindset. porn in general is a disease. consuming porn doesn't make you a bad person really, but the people who distribute such in mass, whether it be the sex industry or even moderately-sized twitter artists, are feeding into this monster that is plaguing the lives of many. And in this case, it's thousands of AuDHD people in fandom communities who are susceptible and open to such influence and let it take over their lives. The reason I know this is cus I see it. Literally All. The. Fucking. Time. On. My. FYP Like do you people ever shut the fuck up about gooning to obese women. It should not be celebrated on your 16+ account ran by a 14yo with like 3 thousand followers who are all 13. We can't bank on this shit any longer. A solution? None. The very least we can do is get reality checks from people like me who are willing to go against a popular opinion. I know for a fact I'm gonna get shit for this thread, and I don't care. Nothing I said was wrong and- it's whole-heartedly disgusting to see this much compliance and apathy towards such dangerous and brain-rotting topics. I want change, I want to see people do better, but it's hard to believe things will improve at this rate. The least I can do is vent about it. In the end, you can't control what someone does with their time. But, there are many ways to healthily deal with fetishism. Therapy, small groups to share your interests, drawing art for yourself. In the end publicizing and celebrating such topics is dangerous and unnecessary thanks for reading! I hope I can enlighten some people with this. remember to take things one step at a time if you struggle with the aforementioned topics.",False,0,28683

Dead by Daylight,381210,208305641,"Dead by Daylight is not an easy or beginner-friendly game by any means. The biggest flaw? It desperately needs an updated tutorial and practice mode. New players have no way to rehearse basic skills like flashlight saves, flash bangs, loops, or facing specific killers. In custom matches, you can only fight bot survivors as killer—never the other way around.

I’ve introduced this game to several friends; 90% quit within their first week. The learning curve is brutal and full of odd mechanics (like having to line up exactly 90° for a fast vault). After nearly a decade, the same issues remain—tunneling and slugging still dominate matches, making the solo experience miserable. Solo queue players are punished by design, since survivors can’t communicate beyond basic gestures (“come here” or “follow me”).

The developers seem to prioritize new content over stability, balance, or beginner accessibility. The business cycle feels predictable: announce a new killer, generate hype, attract new buyers, they realize how unforgiving the game is—and then they leave.

A notable example I would like to point out is Dead by Daylight hasn’t been forced to evolve for nearly 10 years due to lack of major sustainable competition. Until Behaviour Interactive adds quality-of-life features that support new and solo players, I can’t recommend this game to anyone starting fresh.

Verdict: Great concept, deeply flawed execution. 6/10 for veterans, 2/10 for newcomers

this easily was one of my favorite games of all time, I loved the competitive players and the casual players, I loved the gameplay loop and the artistic direction, every thing about this game seemed amazing.
however after sinking a thousand plus hours into the game something is made very clear, this game is designed to get money out of the player base with very little care for the quality of the experience. If you ask any DbD player you will get many stories of how under cooked the game is, about how alienated the devs seem from the community, about how the game is so frustrating that even some devs are recommending not playing it. This all the while new chapters that players who have already paid for the game come out every 3 months, that massively throw off the balance to the point where not owning some of these chapters is outright harmful to your game experience. this as well as many other outstanding issues is why I have left the game, and why I cannot recommend it.

Dead by Daylight,381210,208286772,"Don't play this if you want to play it for Survivor.  You aren't allowed to do anything skillful that might be inconvenient for the killer.  It's just Generator simulator and run the killer for more than 10 seconds.  You are also expected to act like a team but you can't be too coordinated because of course inconvenience is frowned upon.  The game balance is in a constant struggle of balance around premade groups against the killer...which is typically 10% of the playerbase.  The game just doesn't want you to be successful.  It just leads to more nerfs.

Game balance is just constant Survivor nerfs without much to look forward to because any buffs get reverted.  It's all about the Killer experience.

Every update killers are getting buffed while survivors face nerfs.  Even if survivor gets a buff it doesn't last long.  The newest thing for survivor got nerfed into useless within 2 weeks of release.

Survivor progression is terrible.  Everything is nerfed down hard.  You spend your points on useless stuff.   There isn't much incentive to strive for the highest grade every month.  Killers have certain addons to desire for their build but with survivor it's all trash.

Events are terrible--balanced to be typically killer having the advantage.  They aren't really eventful.  No one really participates in the event stuff.  And they are recycled year after year without any changes except balance.  It's an event mode but no one is really having fun.

If you are a survivor and go to the Forums to provide feedback/opinions you are going to get flamed.  It's like survivors can't have an opinion.  Someone is going to argue with you.  It's best to just post your opinion and don't even interact after that.  It's very likely nothing will be done with your feedback because it's coming from a survivor.  There seems to be more action that is beneficial to a killer.

My main issue is that the new killers developed are basically geared towards button masher players. Sure, you can play and get a ton of kills but there's no finesse, no skill involved. And the developers basically want it that way and have decided that instead of a game of skill and stealth in which both killers and survivors hone their abilities, it's now a game of chase. There's no impetus for killers to improve because they're already meeting their ""goals"" of killing. It's become increasingly frustrating for survivors because the pay out is less and less. 

Literally the only reason I play is because I have friends to play and commiserate with. Thank goodness they have 2v8 as a play style to shake things up a bit because now even the seasonal events are filled with try hard killers who only want a lower queue time and are completely unaware of the goals associated with said event and the developers seem to be phoning that in as well.

Dead by Daylight,381210,208255698,"[h1]🔪 Dead by Daylight – The Art of Fear and Survival[/h1]

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

[h2]A Horror Playground That Never Sleeps[/h2]
Dead by Daylight, from Behaviour Interactive, has evolved far beyond its 2016 origins. What began as a modest asymmetrical horror game has become a vast ecosystem of killers, survivors, and licenses spanning the entire horror pantheon. It’s messy, unpredictable, and endlessly replayable—a digital haunted house that reinvents itself with every update.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Gameplay & Core Mechanics: ★★★★☆[/h2]
The 4v1 format remains brilliantly tense. Survivors repair generators while a lone killer stalks them, each side using unique perks and abilities to outthink the other. The learning curve can be brutal for newcomers, but once mastered, matches become thrilling mind games of bluffing, anticipation, and timing.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Atmosphere & Audio Design: ★★★★★[/h2]
Dead by Daylight thrives on atmosphere. Each map tells its own story—fog-shrouded forests, derelict hospitals, and cursed swamps brought to life with chilling soundscapes. The heartbeat mechanic, signaling the killer’s proximity, remains one of the most effective audio cues in gaming—simple, terrifying, and iconic.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Progression & Balance: ★★★☆☆[/h2]
While the perk system and bloodweb progression keep players engaged, balance is a perpetual struggle. Some killers feel oppressive while others lag behind, and new survivors can feel underpowered without the right builds. Frequent patches and reworks show the devs’ commitment, but equilibrium is always fleeting.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Visuals & Performance: ★★★★☆[/h2]
Graphical updates through the “Realm Beyond” project have revitalized older maps and characters with impressive detail and lighting. Performance is stable, though occasional frame drops and matchmaking bugs persist. Still, the visual fidelity now matches the game’s ambition.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Final Verdict[/h2]
[b]Dead by Daylight[/b] endures because it understands one thing: fear is more thrilling when it’s unpredictable. Despite occasional balancing woes, its constant evolution, crossovers, and passionate community make it a living horror anthology. Few games sustain this level of tension and creativity years after release.

[b]In short:[/b] a unique blend of strategy, suspense, and horror storytelling that rewards cunning over brute strength. Whether you prefer to hunt or to hide, Dead by Daylight offers endless nights of adrenaline and dread.",True,4,976

Dead by Daylight,381210,208196954,"tl;dr Game's good, but too broken to play.
There's a lot to chastise this game for. The ever encroaching oversimplification of once robust systems. The community in a constant uproar and argument over fair and unfair tactics and powers. The select few sludge pits that still only communicate through slurs. The devs that have no idea what does well and what does bad in their game, because they simply do not play it. The grinding. The microtransactions. The lacks of polish.

But I can excuse it all. I can move past all that. If it weren't for the crashes and disconnects. I have not had a play session in MONTHS that didn't end with the game still running. Unreal will break. Servers will break. UAC will break. And kick you out of whatever you're doing and you have nothing to show for it.

I absolutely love this game. I've always been a fan of hide and seek games like Prop Hunt, and this scratches that itch. I've always loved horror as a genre and have been a big fan of the walking nightmares that can't be stopped, and this game lets you feel it. I love big crossovers: even when they get kinda outta control like Fortnite or Magic: The Gathering. I love the gameplay loop, I love experimenting with powers and perks, I love being a goofball with the survivors, I love playing a little guitar for the killers. It's so much fun.

not the best game
To start the community in game very toxic. I literally killed some dude and he wasn’t very happy to say the least. Next up the gameplay it’s not the best all it is is running around in circles for the killer. Now for the cast it’s pretty decent they got springtrap and Michael Myers but -1 for no Jason ):< another flaw this game has is the lore is kinda repetitive it’s just some random entity using spooking black fog to kidnap people but the game is still good because it has left 4 dead (peak) and other peak franchises AND it’s an asym which I LOVE so decent rating for that still overall it’s hard for new players to enjoy the game and it’s kinda fallen off

The real answer is ""Sort of, I don't know, maybe.""

[h1] The Good Things [/h1]
- The actual gameplay loop can be fun enough, but it really depends on whether you queue up with other people who want to have fun.
- Active support and events from the development team means you usually have a reason to hop back online.
- Many of the perks lend to player-tailored experiences. Whatever your playstyle is, you can build something at least somewhat enjoyable.

[h1] The Bad Things [/h1]
- The monetization practices in this game are insane. While the initial cost to play is low, it is easy to spend hundreds of dollars on new characters and cosmetics. There are costumes that cost more than the characters who wear them.
- The gameplay is incredibly difficult to balance, and as a result there are often long stretches where it isn't fun to boot up. You have to just sort of wait until the next patch comes out.
- There's a high amount of tired, real-world propaganda in this game. If you know you know. 

[h1] The In-The-Middle Things [/h1]
- There is a lot of lore for the characters in-game, but it is buried in text that even after 1,500 hours I haven't been bothered to read.
- There are plenty of achievements to hunt, but you'll never really 100% the game because the devs keep adding new achievements with every new expansion.
- Many players are frustrating or exploitative. There's an in-game reporting system that works alright, but it doesn't fully deter bad actors.

Dead by Daylight,381210,208156782,"Its hard to put into words why exactly I like playing DBD. I have as many frustrations with this game as the vast and colourful community does; ranging from Behaviour's decision making, the balance issues, and the technical problems that still plague the game on a regular basis. The game is still, like many people like to point out, like an abusive relationship. It hurts, but I cannot stop being around it.

 However, I cannot bring myself to stop playing DBD, and its for one core aspect that I don't think gets highlighted often enough: the singular universe crossover of all these fantastic horror (and semi-horror) IPs and different avenues of horror from Behaviour's own creative lens. If I told any DBD fan back in 2016 when the game first came out that nine years later you'd be playing as Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil being chased by Michael Myers, one of the most iconic slashers of all time, in the Gideon Meat Plant from Saw, I'd think they'd have me institutionalized. Its moments like these where I can just admire the beauty behind the bugs, that I can forget getting tunneled or four outed and just appreciate what is in front of me. Now this goes without saying, but I'd still like the game to be fixed and properly balanced (Behaviour plz).

If you are reading this review wanting to know if DBD is a game for you, I'd say yes, provided that you don't mind getting your butt smacked around often, because the game, as it stands nearly a decade later, I'd argue, is a must play for any fan or enjoyer of horror media.",True,0,60786

Dead by Daylight,381210,208146603,"I got this game in the spirit of the spooky season and Halloween, I loved the concept. It seemed like Super Mario Smash Brothers with horror characters, or a deranged version of Hide and Seek with Survivors vs. Killers- either way, I was curious and I was into it. Because I personally don't like jump scares, I was eager to be a Killer.

Now, not so much. This game has a learning curve and for me it's a little steep. I lost an hour on the Survivor tutorial simply because the instructions weren't clear. The Killer's tutorial was fine. Great, I jumped into live gameplay.

As a Killer, I hate the first-person POV Killers are limited to. I can only see so much, and when chasing after Survivors it's so easy to lose sight/track of them. Maybe there's certain powers/perks to help with that?? I don't know. There's so much to try to understand and learn in this game. Survivors can duck and crouch in order to hide, but Killers can't crouch low and do sneak attacks. So as a Killer I'm basically standing out in the open, trying to go after 4 other players- and, 4 against 1? Really?? I'm new, so, OOooOkay..... I try my best and I honestly feel like a lost, wandering villain trying to catch tadpoles. And if, IF I am able to catch a Survivor, they don't die right away (lol I know that sounds bad)- but what I mean is, they have to be hooked multiple times to get sacrificed. And that's another thing that adds complexity to the game- the multi-steps. There are multiple steps to kill a Survivor, to fix a generator (when playing as Survivor), the gates seemingly take forever to open at the end of the game. Just...lol, come on.

I have no idea how a Killer's ""power move"" actually works because it's not in the Tutorial, nor any other abilities- and my frustration for lack of information is definitely aimed at the developers. On top of that, I haven't found a way to practice as any character of my choosing. In the Tutorials you play as the same character. Sigh. Which means I have to watch YouTube videos and study on gameplay mechanics, learn more about Killers, try to learn learn learn.

And for what??? When I get back in the game, it's still a challenge and not really fun. I'm not against learning new things, but I do care about the ROI (return of investment) on my time- and for this game, considering the amount of time I try to learn how to play it vs the experience in playing it, for me it's not worth it.

I have read comments and reviews about negative interactions in the community and I haven't experienced that. But then again, I'm a Killer who hasn't caught or killed anyone yet, so what would Survivors in those games have to complain about?

Then on top of changes like that buffing healing perks that nerfed before for being unhealthy, but this time sticking it around. From what I've picked up, the current healing meta is stronger than circle of healing and its possible to heal under hook in under 2.5 seconds, making health states meaningless and offering no pressure for the killer.

Then considering a huge buff like adding a significant portion more pallets simply a ""quality of life update,"" while also planning to make big changes that continue to buff survivors and offering almost nothing to killers with the suggested upcoming changes in the current PTB. This company has no idea what balance for their game looks like and asks only survivor sided questions in surveys and then act like killers have no complaints. Its insane. One of the singular most incompetent and disconnected dev teams I've seen in my life, even during their own live stream they don't know why killers slug so much in a match, they're confused.

Dead by Daylight,381210,208100150,"Hello Human, here are some notes to help you on your journey of the DEAD BY DAYLIGHT experience:

- Lots of crossovers, allowing you to play as cool characters from many horror universes

- Game naturally creates chaotic scenarios with all the combinations of perks and addons in play (sometimes for good, sometimes for ill)

- Heavy DLC policy, requiring you to purchase characters. Not as important on the survivor side (since the survivors are essentially cosmetic changes), but on the killer side you are much more limited since they have unique powers you are missing out on. Not as expensive as other games with this same model but still not great practice

- Very poor progression, takes a long time to unlock people. Bloodpoints and Bloodweb system is basically just a waste of time that pulls you out of just playing the game (different currency then the one you use to get characters). Get stuck in scenarios where you want to play a character for their abilities/looks but also want to get other characters just for their associated perks. Further made worse by shrine of secrets being very unforgiving (can't just buy perks, need to get them for a high price from a random weekly rotation of 4/200+ perks) and uses the same currency (Iridescent shards) to buy characters, further complicating the process.

- Game controls are not bad but are strange sometimes (they try to keep it only 2 buttons no matter the cost, even if it means creating these weird cycle mode abilities rather then just have it be 3 separate buttons) (seems to be done to simplify controller, at the expense of keyboard). Not a terribly degrading thing just a bit weird to get used to.

- Quite buggy, some characters are in weird broken states for extended periods of time. For instance, one character named the houndmaster has a dog that follows them. There is about a 10%? chance that using your ability to send the dog out just does nothing, this bug has existed for a very long time considering how impactful it is.

- Design wise is in this weird limbo state where it isn't optimal for either causal nor competitive ways of playing. A good example of this is with map design. Many maps are slightly unoptimal to play more competitively since the RNG makes them not always spawn the same, preventing 100% optimization for cool map-knowledge plays. On the other hand, the way that the RNG is implemented is not very interesting (mostly a reshuffling of generic tiles) so casually it feels essentially like the same map. This basically causes a local minima where neither side is completely satisfied. This philosophy extends onto character design, perk design, and base kit design with particular playstyles.

- Adding onto design philosophy, it is also counter-intuitive and punishing in strange ways. On survivor, you have no ability to see your teammates, see your teammates' perks, or communicate to them via text or voice chat in game. This creates a very large disparity between coordinated teams using discord versus uncoordinated teams, further exacerbated by the difference between coordinated perk and add-on usage versus uncoordinated. The game is obscuring information preventing you from working with your team in the team-based game. On killer, the most logical way to win a 1v4 scenario is to remove one person from the equation as fast as possible (known as tunneling) so that it simplifies the game-state in your favor. It makes then the most sense that on survivor that you need to spread out damage across your team so that no one dies too early. The way that it is currently implemented is in such a manner where tunneling isn't really fun to do or go against, but is also in a state where the game is sort of balanced around it. You are punished for killing in the killing game as a killer. It's not impossible for the game to be fun on both sides while balancing around tunneling being the norm (Identity V does this quite well), and I don't believe that it is impossible to have a scenario where tunneling is one of multiple strategies that exist, but the way DBD handles it again puts it in a local minima where neither side really has as much fun doing it as alternative playstyles (if they win in a scenario where they spread out hooks, it doesn't offer them any unique advantage and is not as decisive of a victory as if they just tunneled), but there is some game scenarios where there isn't really an alternative other than just lose immediately. TLDR, there exists aspects of the game that are punishing and not clear, some of which create a circumstance where the path to victory is not congruent with the most fun way of playing.

- Development time on these aforementioned problems as well as just balance changes in general is very slow. Some changes that one would think would be a easy net positive QOL can take years to implement for not very clear reasons. 

Overall, this game has very good potential, but is stunted from questionable design decisions and progression. It is enjoyable on occasion, but you basically need to completely dissassociate from 1. Winning/Losing  2.  Progression and 3. Bugs (just laugh at them),  in order to have consistent fun. As you can see I have followed this game for a while, so I had a lot to say about it (I have about +100 hours not on this account), and can say that my Disassociation Techinque is one of the most effective techniques in all of gaming, perfectly employable in this specific scenario to be used to the upmost advantage. Good luck out their in the fog soldier, or just play Identity V which is free and is advantaged in almost all areas except graphics and horror icon crossovers.",False,0,2666

Dead by Daylight,381210,208090515,"I used to reccomend this game but its just not fun anymore. As a killer player i feel that the devs are just against me.

I have 223 hours on steam, i have around 450 on other platforms.

So given I have so many hours how can i not reccomend this game? well its because the game keeps changing to be less and less fun. Less and less of what it use to be, its no longer 1 killer trying to kill 4 survivors its just 4 survivors bullying the killer, the only way to get around this is to play 'meta' killers but after 250 hours of nurse i needed some variety so i tried others and boy is the game shit when you aren't meta.  The rest of this is just a rand on the amount of BS the devs added to create this problem.
 
If as killer you pick up a survivor other survivors have 5 or 6 different ways to make you drop them. The survivor them self has 4 ways to make you drop them. 
If you hook someone and they get off the hook they block for a teammate because they have off the record for around a minute of endurance, you get past that and now they have decisive strike, you get past that and its rolling to see if they can get one of the 7 ways to get saved again. The devs said this was all to stop anti tunnelling. The devs solution for the killers using one of the primary win cons of the game was to give the survivors tools to punish the killer for playing the damn game. As the killer the solution then became to just leave people on the ground, you cant pick up so you have to leave them bleed out and apply pressure to the rest of the survivor team.
Then the devs added a ton of anti slugging perks, so if a survivor is left on the ground they can pick themselves up an infinite amount of times, they have insane bleed out timers now, and the devs tried to make this base kit but there was backlash because its stupid, so they made it all part of perks instead. Some of these perks have conditions that pretty much only mean they take effect if the survivors are 4 qued or if they are against a weaker killer who has to use totems.
So the solution was to wait out the perks that puinish picking up but picking them up before they can pick themselves up, so the devs made perks that make it where they make it where if you pick them up after leaving them for a bit they can knock themselves off your shoulder quicker and other BS.
So as a killer you are punished for picking up immediately, punished for leaving them on the ground and punished for waiting and then picking them up, at this point i feel like im getting punished just for trying to play this stupid game yet alone trying to enjoy it.
Gens have been made quicker, the 80s slasher film aesthetic was removed ages ago, There is builds that make the survivors faster than the killer because they added in haste stacking.
That wasnt enough though the survivors needed more so they upped the pallet count on every map to around 20 and then they made all of the pallets stronger, theres far less ""unsafe filler pallets"" they are all safe pallets god forbid survivors learn how to look properly or play the game, instead they give them enough pallets that they can never run dry. Survivors dont even need to think, they just need 3 on gens while one person runs pallet to pallet across the map, if you dont have a chase abillity they are all safe pallets so you cant really outplay them, so you have to break and with the number of pallets you will run out of time and lose, dropping chase to go after somone else just moves the problem along and doesnt solve it.",False,1,13480

Dead by Daylight,381210,208068942,"Been playing this game on and off since 2016 back when their was only 3-4 killers in the game. Now their is currently 41 killers at the time of writing this review. Crazy to see where it's at now, the evolution, and how players have adapted to playing the game over the years with many different perk builds and strategy's to win. I'd describe DBD as pretty chill and casual whilst also being simultaneously competitive and sweaty lol. 

A large variety of maps and killers that keep the gameplay fresh and every match playing out differently depending on the killer and perk builds at play. Lots of recognizable licensed characters included in the game and cool original killer designs that're unique and fun to play as. Many different events and content to explore and learn. (And bugs... AKA ""Features!"")

Whether you wanna play Killer or Survivor... As a new player, you're gonna struggle and lose a bunch in the beginning but that's how you start learning how to play and improving at the game, it takes a couple hours to start getting it and putting the pieces together, both roles have a bit of a learning curve when you first start out. 

I personally enjoy playing as both Killer and Survivor, some players choose to main one or the other... And also complain/whine about the other side being too ""Strong"" or ""OP"" lol. 

As a wise man once said... ""Skill Issue!"" 

Objectively it's pretty straight forward to learn the basics of the game but hard to master it as your more than likely to play against experienced players that know the maps and all the perks inside and out. But I genuinely wouldn't let that stop you from trying it out, their is plenty of fun and goofy moments to be had!

Once you start understanding and getting good at looping on survivor or utilizing a killer's power to it's full potential, the game starts to get pretty fun, enjoyable, and addicting. Out mindgaming an opposing player or looping the killer around the whole map without getting downed during a chase is super satisfying.

Yes, the community can be toxic and angry at times, but what franchise or multiplayer game title isn't nowadays?  

I recommend picking the game up when it's on sale, it goes on sale pretty often. I think it's worth checking out if you're a fan of horror or looking for a different type of multiplayer experience to try out.

One second you’re fixing a gen trying to stay calm, the next you’re being chased across the map. It’s stressful, funny, and insanely fun all at once.

The game balances fear and excitement perfectly. Playing Survivor feels tense and strategic hiding, looping, pulling off clutch saves  while playing Killer makes you feel like a total monster when you outsmart everyone. Each Killer’s power changes how the match plays out, so it never gets boring.

The amount of content is wild too. There are tons of original characters plus collabs with Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Stranger Things, and more. The devs clearly care  they keep adding new stuff and reworking old content to keep it fresh.

Sure, matchmaking and balance can be a bit hit or miss, but when a game clicks, it’s pure adrenaline. That moment when you barely make it through the exit gate or land a perfect 4K as Killer? Unreal.

Dead by Daylight,381210,208017689,"🔪 “Dead by Daylight” — A Country Boy’s Guide to Screamin’ in the Dark

Now I done played a lotta games in my day, but Dead by Daylight? That one’ll raise your blood pressure faster than a possum in a henhouse.
It’s a game where four poor souls try to fix some broke-down generators while one mean ol’ killer hunts ’em like a coon on a Saturday night.

It ain’t fair.
It ain’t peaceful.
And Lord help me, I keep playin’ it anyway.

🌲 The Setup

You got two sides:

Survivors — four of y’all runnin’ around like chickens with your heads cut off, fixin’ engines and hopin’ you don’t get grabbed.

The Killer — one nasty son of a gun with a big weapon, spooky music, and a hobby for collectin’ screams.

Simple as cornbread, but every match feels like a new brand of chaos.

⚙️ What Keeps Folks Comin’ Back

1. The thrill, boy, the thrill.
Ain’t nothin’ quite like hearin’ that terror radius thumpin’ while you crouch in the bushes whisperin’, “Please don’t see me, please don’t see me.” Then BOOM — the killer shows up, and you start runnin’ like you just saw your ex at Walmart.

2. The teamwork.
You can’t make it out alone. You gotta help your buddies off hooks, patch up their boo-boos, and yell when the killer’s comin’.
Course, sometimes your “teammates” run off and hide behind a tree while you’re screamin’ on a hook — but that’s just DBD life.

3. The killers are wild.
They got everything from creepy nurses and chainsaw maniacs to Wesker himself from Resident Evil. Each one’s got their own tricks, and learnin’ ’em all’s half the fun (and half the trauma).

4. Customizin’ your survivor.
You can dress up your character any way you want — cowboy hat, bunny suit, Christmas sweater — lookin’ good don’t save you, but it sure feels nice dyin’ in style.

🪓 What’ll Grind Your Gears

Now I ain’t gonna lie — Dead by Daylight ain’t perfect.

The matchmaking’s rougher than gravel. Sometimes you get killers so sweaty they must’ve been born with a mouse and keyboard in their hands.

Bugs and lag. Ever vault a window and get hit through it anyway? Yeah, happens more often than a deer in the headlights.

Toxic players. Some folks teabag at the exit gates like they just won the lottery. Bless their little hearts.

And don’t even get me started on them flashlight heroes — blindin’ you mid-chase like they’re takin’ senior portraits.

🔥 Verdict from the Porch

If I had to sum it up:
Dead by Daylight is a beautiful, broken, nerve-wrackin’ mess — and I love it to death.

It’ll make you laugh, it’ll make you rage, and sometimes it’ll make you sit in silence questionin’ your life choices. But every round’s got that special mix of terror and fun that keeps you comin’ back for “just one more game.”

⭐ Rating: 8/10 bloody hooks
💬 “Like hide-and-seek, if hide-and-seek involved trauma, teamwork, and bad internet.”

🧢 Final Words

If you’re lookin’ for a scary good time with friends, or you just enjoy chasin’ folks through the woods with a machete (virtually, of course), Dead by Daylight hits the spot.

Just remember — when you hear that heartbeat, don’t look back.

You simply cant react in this game to anything. You need to see every move ahead and i dont have 13000 hours in it. 
As Surivor your teamates often simply do no gens or anything at all, as soon as someone is hooked. Everybody loses their mind.  
The fact that can simply DUCK UNDER certain OVERHEAD-Strikes, like from nemesis is pure bullshit. 
All the killers and survivors mostly feels the same. They could make it so much more fun, but there are basicly only 2-3 version of anything.  
Killer 'Bloodlust' sometimes just doesnt trigger, even while im chasing. Why you ask? Because im not close enough, while im chasing them for already 12 seconds. Sorry i see them 15 meters away and not just 10.
Rushbuild and bullybuild fell like you play the game with basicly only 3 gens.  
Game has a great fun factor for a while. But it start to suck real fast if you cant predict the future. 
149 hours in, and i still cant even use all of the abilities, since i cant earn enough bloodpoints to simply level all the characters needed for some builds.  And you cant even go for some abilities you WANT to use, no. You often HAVE TO level some shitty placeholder-skill that has been nerfed 18 times so its absolute useless,  noone knows why its there and you just cant delete it. So maybe you get the skill you want to T3 only at prestige 3 if your unlucky.  Same goes for some 'Addons'. Really? ONE WHOLE SECOND more to some stat, you get no use out of, because your dude needs an oxygentent as soon as he hit someone. 
You dont play killers, you play slowass tanks that need to reload after every shot. Doesnt matter if hit the target or not.

This game need a serious rework.",False,0,10087
Dead by Daylight,381210,208009859,"In short, Dead By Daylight is a very fun and addicting game with a well known toxic community.

Though I have not experienced much toxicity during my playtime apart from a few harsh complaints every ten matches or so. There is much to love about this game if you can just focus on the fun. Plenty of killers to pick from, either from your favorite slasher films or completely original killers. My favorite is the cowboy with a harpoon gun, who has a very simple but fun hook-based gameplay. And of course Dracula himself because he looks awesome and I love the Castlevania games. If you are not a competitive person, that being someone who is not focused on winning with the best killer/survivor with the best builds and play purely for your own enjoyment out of either saving your teammates and being scared of and seeking to out smart/manoeuvre the killer or being the killer themself and enjoy the tracking/chasing element, I absolutely recommend to get this game. I may just be lucky but if you are doubtful to get this game because of its community, I've had more wholesome matches and encounters than I have had with the games well known flashlight bullies and very harsh post game commenters. At the end of the day, it's just a game that you have your right to play how you wish, be it a scummy playstyle or not. 

In conclusion from my experiences, ignore the tier lists and the many harsh videos you may see, this game has plenty of love put into it and the community is very large. Play for your own fun, be it losing or winning, as long as you enjoy the many moments in that one match and play how you want to play, I believe you could love this game too.  Hopefully the Pinhead killer will come back with the new Hellraiser game coming out, cause i missed my chance to get him and he looked quite fun.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207991942,"So, I think I like the game? I think it's good for fun with friends and to hunt down some survivors.... With that said, this game absolutely SUCKS as a new player. The community is pretty toxic to start, but that can be ignored. What really holds me back as a new player is this damn Perk / Bloodweb system. 

I get this crippling indecision when it comes to what killer/survivor I start with or choose and where I should spend my blood tokens. In the early levels, Killers/Survivors with out a decent build kind of suck.... so you're never quite sure if that's how they play, or if you just haven't put ENOUGH blood tokens in. Now the game gives them to you frequently, and I feel like it's something I can get over, but the new player systems in this game are atrocious. 

Outside of the that, the griefing from players is WILD. These people are rude, they hate when you play the killer well, and they hate when you aren't the best either. They will make your games miserable and the match making will make damn sure to put you in groups with folks who are way above your capabilities. 

With all that negative said, the gameplay loop is fun, the Killers are really fun and unique, when you're not in a totally mean game... It's a much better experience with friends.",True,8,3401

Half the killer roaster experiences huge bugs with game breaking messes being left in the game for months at a time. Developers do not care about you and your experience as a killer as they nerf every viable strategy and have tried to fix base mechanics to prevent you from playing competitively, instead of promoting other ways of play. Meanwhile survivors don't get touched for years and by Behaviour Data Samples they are the victims. Said researched data is collected in nonsensical ways suchs as the little form some players get when uninstalling, where complaining about killer balance is a selectable option....but survivor balance isn't. This on top of a game engine on 15 years on a game that's been developed to be a small project at best, every little bug fix creating game breaking scenarios like cutting off a hydra's head. And of course unnanounced changes such as a recent patch placing around 30% more pallets on most maps....because? We've not had a good explanation as of yet. Balancing Core gameplay mechanics has been rough for them recently as they've given survivors 3-4 major core gameplay buffs and have given killers 700 bloodpoints in return. This is not a valuable currency and not even enough to buy a single small item (of which you need thousants). And then you have the cheating problems with even average players experiencing cheating on weekly basis and streamers being attacked. Biggest recent attack being on the DEVELOPER STREAMS being shut down mid promotional stream, because their private server got hacked. It's insane the amount of neglect this game is receiving. In their ""Quality of LIfe"" era, an year long break from constant content, in which they promised to try to fix many of the issues this game has, they released MORE content and every update has broken the game even more. The Houndmaster has released and still is a buggy mess, The Walking Dead update made the game physically unplayble breaking core mechanics for more than a week, half the killer roaster is unplayable against semi competent survivor teams, and their attempts to rework an old bad killer have resulted in making them WORSE?!?. The community is a 50/50 of people that genuinely care about the game with amazing content creators and community cultivators and then you have the sc*m of the earth loggin in only to make your afterwork hours unplayable, and take a moral highground in post game chat calling you a tunneler, unskilled killer, you deserved it, you play x, you play y, you camp etc. They will find a reason to blame you even if your only form of tunneling is hooking someone twice in a role in a 12 hook game. Being into the core idea and artstyle of this game has been a STRUGGLE for me with a bunch of hours on epic games instead of this platform. Those are ONLY recent issues and the list can go on and on. This game is on borrowed time until the developers eat themselfs like an ouroboros. They don't care about retaining players they just want your money for the hype dlc so they can fund the next one. This could have been a passion project if anyone on Behaviour cares. The bug report goes directly into their bin aswell as the reported cheaters we've had in our games. Mind you Twins is 5 years old killer and still has gamebreaking bugs with new ones with every patch. On top of everything in their most recent dev blog they blamed 40+ % of killers of tunneling in their games without explaining how they got to that conclussion, which has lead to survivor side using their statement to harrass killer players even more. They also couldn't explain to themselves how on the map ""The Game', the most pallet filled map there is, slugging is a more popular strategy. Instead of Embracing Slugging and Tunneling as viable SITUATIONAL options and rewarding you for not always doing them, they wholeheartedly try to remove them. With no such limitations even being suggested towards the survivor side. 

This was all without the new player progression and the crazy monetization and hours needed to farm a character without reaching for your wallet. I was lucky I got the game for free. Paying a crisp 20 for 4ish characters out of 50 is insane and asking players to spend 40+ hours for each one they are missing is even crazier. 

This was a long messy rant but I wanted to put it out there. Every so often they hype me up with a new release I get on and quickly realise that the game is even more PHYSICALLY unplayable than before. Unless they change the code of the game from ground up, and try to listen to their community (Killers uncluded) this game will slowly fade away into irrelevance as it's already doing. I love the concept of this game but that's all I can say so deep into the rabithole. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY and it's unholy patch launches.

The only problem I have with the game is that the survivor side can get a bit boring if you're not doing chases. Especially since all you do is hold right mouse while occasionally pressing space.

the only interesting thing about the game is playing killer and it sucks dick by design because the people who play survivor have the ear of BHVR and made the game what they wanted.

Play the game, trudge through infinite games where you only get a single kill because you don't have the fucking perks to make your character viable, you end up playing the game the only way you know how, the survivors can do random YOLO shit, dance all over your head and still cry about it. BHVR are the true culprits behind dogshit like slugging and tunneling. If playing ""regular"" was half as rewarding then we wouldn't have to do it just to get a 2k vs people who are obviously in a discord call. Nevermind the imaginary rulebook killer players are held to, and nevermind the fact that it's alright for the survivors to rush objectives with ridiculous speeds, but if the killer tries to do the same he gets compared to the Austrian painter.

I have to play so much of the game just to get the ""normal"" optimal setup. Everything is gated behind a progression skilltree, I don't have the perks to stop people from completely countering my power, and as soon as I load into a game its a 4 stack of people with flashlights and medkits. I'm fucking tired.

This game is so much better as a viewing experience rather than having to sit behind the controls and actually play because its just an elaborate glorified ragebait for the killer player.",False,2,1380
Dead by Daylight,381210,207937321,"This game has become unbearable. Every damn match is filled with sweaty premade groups who whine the moment you outplay them with legitimate killer tactics.

It’s exhausting dealing with this nonsense. I wish I could get a damn refund, I regret buying this game and its DLCs.",False,2,49659
Dead by Daylight,381210,207936944,"Okay, I have joined this game in late 2025 (yes, very late, I'm well aware), but I really want to give my honest thoughts on this game, its community, and overall how I feel after spending the past 2/3 months playing. 


The Good:
[b]- The Community:[/b] I've never played a game were overall, majority of the community are such a decent group of humans. I will also say, as someone LGBTKFCBLT, I greatly appreciate the range of diversity in the player base. Its so warming to see so many pride banners/charms in end game screens and I love being able to go to peoples Twitch streams to friendly banter about the fun game we just played. Yeah, there's a few bad eggs here and there, but go play Overwatch, or (heaven forbid) Valo/League for a day. I promise you this game is nothing like that. I feel very grateful to have only been playing a few months and already built strong friendships. 

[b]- Gameplay:[/b] DBD has found a sweet spot in a genre no other game has been able to even come close to. A asymmetrical horror game which not only feels rewarding to play in both roles but gives you drive to continue to play more. I can't stand the amount of stuff I've seen online about how certain killers are broken or certain perks are horrible to play against. This game has hundreds of things its trying to manage and honestly, I feel like it does a pretty good job! 


The Bad:
[b]- Onboarding experience and early gameplay: [/b] DBD is by far one of the hardest games I have ever had to learn to play in my life. The game does a terrible job at explaining certain nuances the game has such as item usage, displays (like girl, wtf are these icons on the right hand of my screen? I still don't know!), perks, and offerings. Swear I didn't use an offering for the first 100 hours of playing. I fear that this is not just a me issue. Not to mention the amount of killers and survivors in this game makes picking it up at such a late stage to be a very difficult process. You could argue that learning curve is part of the fun, sure! But in 2025 were everyone has a -5 attention span, people need to get into the game and get into it fast a feel like they know what they are doing. 

[b]- Match making:[/b] Christ all mighty. Why am I going against people who have THOUSANDS of hours in this game when I literally just started playing? It loops back to the first point where I have no idea how I'm suppose to learn the game when I'm consistently going against people who live and breath this game. 


The Ugly:
[b]- Your hatred for Behaviour as developers: [/b] Look I'm going to be so real. You (YES YOU), do not understand how good you have it. I get it, you may have played for years, what would little pleb me know, but in the short few months I've played this game, I've seen devs who listen, act and amend errors faster than any other live service game I've played. I'm honestly in awe of how they do it with consist bug updates, regular new content, and gameplay that feels fresh and new. It's YOU who has to whinge and whine about how bad you have it. I fear this is just an issue that will never be resolved for a game that is as old as it is. It's giving very 'bitter old man who didn't get his way' but you've been wined and dined for years on end. 


I hope this is helpful for at least someone. I feel this has to be one of the most rewarding games I've ever played and I hope to continue spending my time playing such an amazing game with (mostly) an amazing community. ♥♥♥.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207921728,"This is the first game I've ever bought on Steam, and I loved it. I got into the game by watching people like No0b3 and Otzdarva play it all the time when I was younger, and for the collaborations they did with horror icons. I always played killer since I didn't have friends to play survivor with, but I eventually learned to play both at some point. However, I would be lying if I said I enjoyed playing it anymore. 

I don't know if it's the fact that I'm getting older, that I've played more games I enjoy, or if it's the game itself that has changed, but every time I come back to play, there's always something that makes me step away from the game for a while. Whether it's an adjustment to perks making them more broken or useless, bugs and hackers, new mechanics, or even just toxic players, I just can't find a reason to stick around after getting back into the game.

This game is notorious for being an unbalanced mess and having a toxic community. I haven't encountered many toxic people in the game since around 2019, when I started, but I've seen so many toxic people outside the game that it absolutely makes me hate playing. I cannot recommend playing the game at all in its current state. Playing as the survivor or killer is miserable in their own way, and I have played against more hackers than I ever have during the rest of the time I have played this game.

I think you could also argue this game is pay to win in a way, I don't know if I would call it exactly that, but there's definitely a huge advantage you get from buying certain licensed DLC either for the perks or the killer themselves, but I think using them effectively still requires skill although that still doesn't change how unfair killers can be sometimes as much as I love playing them.

Playing survivor is fun and simple for the most part, especially if you're playing with friends or in a group. But I do think there are some problems that you face when playing against certain killers that just aren't fun to play against.

And playing as killer is horrendous. I love playing killer, but it feels like there's a set list of rules you have to follow, or else survivors will just complain about how you played. On top of that, you have to deal with bully squads that just make the whole game about harassing you. I enjoy friendly survivors, but getting them every other match can be annoying. Sometimes I just want to play the game, and then I'm the one at fault when I kill them because they didn't want to play a normal match.

I want this game to do well, but every year I feel like it just gets worse and worse. The only thing keeping it alive for me now is the collaborations they do, but even that is starting to not feel like enough anymore.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207912101,"I wish I could delete this game and move on, but I can't without some form of closing remarks. Its like watching a old friend relapse on repeat, begging for a second chance it never earned. 

I swapped to PC recently, so it only shows 150sh hours of playtime, but I have thousands of hours sunk into this game on console from ever since it was released on console years back. 

This game is not worth your time. Its not worth your cash, its not worth your creative talents, like fan-art or anything of that nature. I'd argue its not even worth your pity. Dead by daylight is a game that took over the 4v1 genre by that of sheer luck and the introduction of constant updates. Nothing more, and I will not accept otherwise. If evolve managed to not be owned by 2k, it would still be around. If DBD didn't get a new killer from a horror movie fans already like every two months, other games would have stuck around.

So, being a titan only supported by the fact other games cannot keep up or are dead on arrival because DBD fans would rather eat their own vomit than attempt to try a new game, they crumble, and DBD is once again free to abuse its player-base without failure. 

These people think you are a moron. They ignore issues the community has, famously, until their primary spokesperson plays a game on stream (after being bullied into it) to be repeatedly shown directly what the community had been begging for a change since its inception. Only then did it change. 

They do not care about you, they never have. They do not care for the hundreds of bugs that plague this game, they never have. They do not care what state the game is in, they never have. 

They don't have to. They never have. 

If you want a horror game that's worth it, look into more indie projects, or co-op horror such as the outlast trials, or hell, play physically any other game that isn't DBD. The devs do not care for you. 

And the fan-base? I have never met a more moronic group of vomit chugging idiots in my life. This game is dominated by wanna be twitch streamers (always offline, btw) that endlessly want to farm clips and punch below the belt with bug abuse or ""techs"" because the devs, shockingly, do not care. Few in this community deserve it, such as Otz and Henz, but lets be real, people watch them for their own personalities, not this clusterfuck of a game.

The only negative that is worth mentioning is that the game can feel very killer-sided. This means it feels like the game is in favor of the killer.

They have proven time and time again that they don't play their game, are survivor sided, or are listening so hard to their data that they forget that there are 4 more survivors in the game than killers. While Dead by Daylight the game might survive for a year, in a year from now, if the devs balance in the way that they said they wanted to, this game is going to only get worse and worse for killer players. If you're a survivor player the game could be good to play if you can handle increasingly long queue times as people leave the role and increasingly hardcore killers to go up against as the few people remaining play stronger and smarter. I used to love Dead by Daylight, but unfortunately, this game is at the end of its life and I can't do it anymore.

Most of my wins bc the killer lets us go
Most of my games are the killer hooks everyone twice then the killer wants us to do the generators - so boring - this is prob why the game is unbalanced bc the game stats are all wrong.
Survivor perks arent very helpful and feel pointless against how strong killers are.
Some perks will drop your rating, like the unhook one, if you fail at unhooking yourself which is most likely, then what is the point again to these perks>?

- it was free on epicgames. many players exploit those accounts for griefing.
- cheats are publicly available through a little bit of youtube search. i've finally had enough of it when i met my first encounter with a group of survivor cheater / exploiter.
- matchmaking had never been fair. i'm often paired with clueless people, or P100. i've just bought the game 2 weeks ago.
- many seasoned players testified about the possibility of you getting banned just from baseless accusations. i don't want to risk my steam account being marked or even punished as a cheater.

The amount of issues it has up the rear but seems to ignore is also crazy, not to try and blame devs of incompetence or anything but sometimes it does sound like the game plays favoritism. I understand DBD has kinda reached a level where it doesn't have to really try, since its immensely popular, has multiple killers and fandom favorites with no other game really rivalling it(the closest was f13th for a while but look what happened there, TCM died immediately and no one really seemed to be playing that Killer Klowns game? Unfortunate. Hopefully the Halloween game will be decent)and that's a shame. 

Anyway, they need to really pull back on this inherent need to overfill the map with pallets and window vaults everywhere, which ruins the matches for a lot of killers. Redesign the maps to not be sided in really either team's favor, and maybe make it so you don't see the same 4 survivor perks being the only used ones...survivor power creep is real and that's really unfortunate.

While getting up to speed you'll end up tunneled and slugged as someone in serious need of therapy humps your body as a newbie survivor or bullied with sabotage toolboxes and flashlights and t-bagged at the exit gate as a newbie killer. If you still persist be prepared for most of your friends to rage quit the game at some point and to be constantly disappointed at the devs inability to achieve any sort of balance in gameplay. Solo Queue for survivor is the seventh circle of hell, updates to counter certain OP killers turn other killers into a sad joke, and many of the most useful perks are locked on characters that require cash or in-game grinding to unlock.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207749253,"When I first started playing Dead by Daylight, I genuinely thought I’d found one of the most exciting multiplayer horror games ever made. The first 100 hours or so were a blast, running from killers with friends, pulling off clutch saves, and feeling that rush of tension as the exit gates opened. But once your MMR starts to climb, that fun quickly evaporates. The game goes from thrilling to downright miserable, and it’s honestly shocking how steep the falloff in enjoyment is.

At higher MMR, the game feels completely unbalanced. Killers suddenly move faster, hit from ridiculous distances, and seem to have a supernatural ability to track you no matter what. The supposed “skill based” matchmaking doesn’t really feel like it takes into account teamwork or playstyle; you just get thrown against sweaty killers with pinpoint accuracy and map knowledge that make most matches feel hopeless.

And the tools survivors get to fight back? Practically useless. Flashlights almost never work properly; you can aim dead on and still get nothing. Pallet stuns feel inconsistent, sometimes they register, other times the killer just powers through like nothing happened. Even perks that are meant to help counter killer pressure barely make a difference at high levels because of how oppressive killer perks and add ons have become.

The worst part is how predictable the experience becomes. If the killer isn’t brand new, they will catch you, it’s only a matter of time. There’s no real comeback potential unless the killer makes a huge mistake or decides to give you a pity escape. That feeling of tension that once made the game fun is replaced by frustration, because it’s not about skill anymore, it’s about how long you can delay the inevitable.

Dead by Daylight has a solid foundation, and for casual players or newcomers, it can still be enjoyable. But for anyone who plays long enough to get decent, the experience becomes punishing and unrewarding. It’s like the game actively punishes you for improving. Until the developers seriously rework MMR and address balance issues between killers and survivors, I can’t recommend it beyond the first few dozen hours. It’s fun until it isn’t. Then it’s just pain.",False,17,10945

Dead by Daylight,381210,207746047," My Dead by Daylight Review:

This used to be one of my favorite games ever.
I’ve been playing since 2018 with over 2000 hours across different platforms — but every year, it somehow gets worse. It honestly feels like the game is trying to bury itself.

Every update feels like the devs spin a wheel labeled:
“Buff random killer,” “Nerf fun perk,” “Add useless map,” “Release gooner skin.”
And somehow, they manage to do all four.

Every update brings more frustration: killers with broken or boring powers, perks that are either insanely overpowered or completely useless, and maps that feel like they were made by an AI with zero balance or creativity.

On top of that, the game has basically turned into a Pay-to-Win collab fest — every new partnership adds killers or perks that give unfair advantages, unless you spend money. It’s exhausting.

They even ruined some of the most fun perks, like Dead Hard, which has been nerfed into near uselessness. Add to that the never-ending hackers, the toxic community, and those awful “gooner” skins — absolute tragedy. Who asked for that? Not the players who actually cared about this game, that’s for sure.

I genuinely miss when Dead by Daylight was great — fun, tense, and full of real competition.
Now it’s just a mess.",False,15,20319

Dead by Daylight,381210,207744478,"Attention all who may be interested in this game,

DO NOT buy this game. You'll get it and think ""OMG this is scary and exciting!""... You might even think it's a great game for a while.. but then the curtains will rise...

First you will start playing survivor with your friends, using discord to communicate and scream while still thinking its fun but somehow the killer always catches you or finds you way too quickly. You'll escape a few times and think you did really well. This will go on for a few games but then you will get out of the bot Match Making Rating (MMR), and realize you will only ever go against three (3) killers. Blight, Nurse, and Ghoul... You'll think I just need to learn their quirks and I can probably run them forever. Only 300 hours in and you'll still last only two (2) loops at best against any of those three (3) killers that know what they're doing. You and your friends will grow tired of not having all the perks, and the constant tunneling off hook... the frustration will grow until your friends move on to a non-trash game and thus you are now ready to move to the next phase of self hatred.. Playing killer.

With no friends or good teammates left on this trash game you will phase over to the dark side. At the beginning you'll 4k (kill all 4 survivors) every match or get new players who run in straight lines for instant downs.. you'll think ""Oh this is so easy!"". Then once again you will get out of the bot MMR and learn the reality.  Endless pallets on large maps and the more than often toxic Survive with Friends (SWF) who communicate with each other the entire game, and will body-block or try and flashlight/pallet save on every single down. Endgame becomes a endless walls of bodies for a down, and you'll start to let the bad thoughts consume you... why shouldn't I play Blight, Nurse, or Ghoul.. I am probably really good at them (you're not) and when you start 4k'ing with the sweatiest perks you can use you'll think.. ""Wow I am amazing at this game!"" (You are not) and you'll continue the vicious cycle. You'll start to turn on all survivors who are trying their best and realize they are the reason the Dead by Daylight (DBD) community sucks and they are the ones who keep running off their DBD playerbase. Then once that hatred really becomes you.. the process starts over and you go back to survivor.

Once you are empty and returned back to your survivor base... you'll think you know everything there is about killers and start to use every cheesy strategy, perk, and trick that once infuriated you as a killer.. and laugh as they now feel your pain and you start to get out at least 50% of the time... you'll think you are top tier with your 500 hours (you're not) and you'll start being toxic in chat against the same killers you play but now they don't play ""fair"" by community standards. This soul sucking cycle will then repeat until you have 1000 hours... and then 3000 hours.. There truly won't be a day where you don't hate yourself playing at this point.

If you have made it this far I can now truly tell you the real reason to never play this game. The developers. They are selfish, greedy, and tunnel-visioned. They will look at their #s across all DBD games and translate any high % of perk usage to overpowered and thus needing a nerf. They will add requirements like ""must heal someone"" or ""must be unhooked"" or ""after 2 downs""... they literally make perks have requirements because they can't balance perk combinations. Then while nerfing both sides they will create bugs that will exist over a span of months, and then fix them only to recreate bugs that existed years before. They will blame the community when they get negative feedback, and they will say the next patch will fix slugging and tunneling (it won't). The real tragedy is these developers don't play the game and when they do they are only as good as bot MMR. Probably modeled the bots after their gameplay, tbh. They don't listen to the community and will continue to kill this game with their ignorance. All while keeping the same three (3) killers buffed, and same meta perks for survivors as the only real options. Fun is not a business model for them, greed and stupidity is what powers Behavior.

Final notes, this game will promise greatness and only succeed in making you hate yourself while making you play again the day after. It's a depressing cycle that never gets better, You'll eventually leave and you'll be better off for it, May it come sooner rather than later.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207725606,"I would recommend the game but at the same time, probably not? Don't get me wrong its really fun sometimes, and with the amount of perks and characters the game has you almost always have something new to play with. But my biggest gripe is the bugs and repetitiveness that the game can cause. Not every perk is good, some barely do anything, and in other cases the killer you want to play just isn't good all round (wassup fellow pig mains). Whether its overbalancing or neglect most killers just don't make the cut, forcing you to play whats meta.

Lets take ghostface for example, great character, love the design and abilities, but hes really good. Undetectable. can instantly down people he marks. Overall really strong.
Then there's the pig, she also has undetectable, but she cant insta down, plus it takes longer for her to crouch that ghostface the only saving grace is a dash ability. And her main ability is just really lackluster. Sure if the person doesn't know how to take off the reverse bare trap then you'll definitely get use out of it but that's usually only when people have never faced her before. Experienced players would get them off instantly (plus you only have a super limited amount). 

The pig is a case of trying to overbalance a character and it ends up being way too weak. Then they never touch them again. So if you don't play the meta then you don't win. Now this isn't a deal-breaker, I'm sure if you're picking the game up for the first time you'll have fun, but just don't main one killer, one second you're on top of the world the next you're struggling to get a single hook",True,0,17856

Then they scratch their heads and wonder ""why is Nurse still so OP"", and survivors continue to cry about Nurse. 

Developers haven't been able to figure out that if they continue to show blatant favoritism to survivors through some incredibly stupid changes (pallet density update ruining every M1 killer only to amount to barely a nerf to Blight, planned Xenomorph and Knight changes that would've dumpstered the killers had the community not raised a big stink about it, nerfed Weave Attunement and gutted Franklin's Demise just bc killers could read auras if survivors loaded up on items, I could go on), eventually players will just leave.

Dead by Daylight (DbD) is the ultimate realization of a horror slasher scenario turned into a relentless, high-stakes game. This 4v1 asymmetrical horror setup is genius: the Survivors face genuine, cinematic terror, while the Killer gets the pure horror power fantasy.

You are absolutely right—every single move matters. The game perfectly translates the horror movie dynamic where every step dictates the fate of the game. That intrigue and tension come from the silence of sneaking, the pounding heart of a chase, and the sheer dread of hearing the Killer's terror radius approach. The way the game forces you to rely on teammates is where the real drama is born; those moments of perfect coordination feel incredible, but the ""triggers"" you mentioned from an unreliable or selfish teammate are just as intense and true to a horror movie experience.

It’s a living, breathing horror universe that only gets better with its constant flow of original lore and, crucially, the vast implementation of legendary licensed horror icons. The ability to play as Killers like Freddy Krueger or Michael Myers, and try to escape from classic settings like the Raccoon City Police Station or Haddonfield, transforms the game from a simple survival match into a genuine, terrifying horror cinematic simulator. If you want a game that translates the adrenaline and unpredictability of cinematic horror into endless multiplayer sessions, this is the one.",True,0,1253

Forgive me, Father.
I’ve… sinned again. Yeah, big surprise.

I told myself I wouldn’t camp this time. That I’d be fair, merciful even.
But then they started teabagging at five gens, and well — You understand, right?

I hooked one. Then two. Then three.
I told myself it was justice.
But truth is… I just wanted to hear them scream again. It’s almost peaceful now. Like choir practice, but louder.
Sometimes I feel bad. Then I remember they brought four flashlights and a map.

“And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced.”

They keep calling me toxic. 
I told myself I’d stop tunneling. But she ran straight to the hook. What was I supposed to do-

Every match starts with hope — ""This time, we’ll escape together!"" Ten minutes later, I’m hiding in a bush watching my teammate try to “360” the Killer like it’s a TikTok tutorial while I miss every single skill check within a 10-mile radius.

At some point, you stop fearing the Killer and start fearing your teammates. You heal someone for 90% of the bar and they run away. You unhook them and they sprint directly back to the Killer. One time I watched a guy crouch behind a rock for the entire match. Respect.

Playing survivor feels like being in a group project where one person screams, one person hides, one person gets sacrificed immediately, and one person actually does the gens. (It’s never me.)

And then I tried Killer. I thought it’d be empowering. Nope. It’s just me getting flash-lighted by three Claudette's while one teabags me at the exit gate.

It’s a coverup for one of the greatest mass murders in history, made by one of the most prominent empires.

Australia does not exist. All things you call “proof” are actually well fabricated lies and documents made by the leading governments of the world. Your Australian friends? They’re all actors and computer generated personas, part of the plot to trick the world.

Australia is one of the biggest hoaxes ever created, and you have all been tricked. Join the movement today, and make it known that they have been deceived. Make it known, that this has all just been a cover-up.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207617619,"Dead by Daylight is one of the most exciting and unique multiplayer horror games available today. Developed by Behaviour Interactive, the game stands out because of its thrilling asymmetrical gameplay, where four survivors face off against one killer in a deadly game of cat and mouse.

One of the main reasons Dead by Daylight is such a good game is its intense atmosphere. The dark maps, creepy sound design, and suspenseful music create constant tension, making every match unpredictable and exciting. Whether you’re hiding in the shadows or chasing down survivors, the fear and adrenaline never fade.

Another great aspect is its variety and customization. There are dozens of survivors and killers to choose from, each with unique abilities and perks. This allows players to find a playstyle that fits them—whether they prefer stealth, teamwork, or aggressive tactics. The constant updates and collaborations with famous horror franchises like Stranger Things, Resident Evil, and Silent Hill also keep the game fresh and interesting.

The game also encourages teamwork and strategy. Survivors must repair generators and help each other escape, while the killer must outsmart and hunt them down. Every match feels different, and success depends on skill, communication, and quick thinking.

Finally, Dead by Daylight has a strong community and continues to grow with new content, events, and balance changes. This keeps players engaged and ensures that the game remains challenging and fun over time.",True,1,50248

Dead by Daylight,381210,207596240,"Buggy/poor scripting that disrupts game play experience. Terrible match-making. Rude, troll players (killers mostly). And a disrespectful community. Luckily, there are other multiplayer games out there that are a better use of your time and money. 

To put things into perspective for those interested, it took 9 years for the developers to realize that players didn't want to wait while being downed, so they added the ""abandon"" feature. Players now can leave when there's game play abuse. Before, a killer can down all four survivors and wait until they bleed out one-by-one. It's 4 minutes of dying state per survivor; all you do is crawl on the ground while hearing your avatar groan the same looping audio and killer chase music. Now imagine having that for multiple matches per session. 

Is that really an enjoyable game experience? And what about getting off hook and the killer is just outside hook range just to hook you again? Well, that's not fun - solo-queue or with friends. Anyone who complains about SWF (survivor with friends) doesn't understand that not everyone plays squad, and if they are, then its not on a regular basis.

I would have liked to play the original DBD when it was first released. The maps looked bigger, atmosphere moodier, and it was more about stealth. Sure, the game play experience was minimal and simple. But it felt closer to what the game was originally inspired by: the 80s horror/slasher films where killers are unrelentless pursuers and victims needing to hide and outwit with the fewest of meager resources. Really, who was one of the first licensed IP killers for this game? 

Now, DBD has transitioned into a confusing mess of an arcade game where you need a user manual to know what killer/survivors you are grouped with and what overpowered add-ons they have. The steep learning curve for survivors is so laughable that it makes total sense that most players main as killers in this game. It's almost always 1.5 percent bonus blood points for survivors.
 
Over the years, I wished for bigger/diverse maps and unique generators with different skill checks/challenges. After all, with each new survivor and killer for a chapter, you would expect further commitment towards holistic improvement of the game experience. Instead, I have seen corporate miscommunication, mile-long messages noting latest bug patches/kill switches, and unfulfilled promises. One can say that the game is for ""casual"" players, but that doesn't excuse it being downright unplayable at times. 

But what do I know? Maybe in this day and age, an obviously broken game can manipulate people to actually think it takes skill and mind games to win when it's easy for players to abuse the game play and ruin the fun. At the end of the day, there are no substantial preventive/counter measures towards ensuring fair play despite the so-called initiative for anti-slugging, anti-camping, and anti-tunneling that were made to address DBD's current rework. And by the way, afk killers don't get penalized but survivors do when they're afk? So a boring free win is acceptable and I get penalized for wanting to leave a stalling match? Am I missing something here?

There were moments when I enjoyed the game and its spooky campy vibes. There aren't a lot of multiplayer games in the horror genre which makes DBD one of the few. But this year, there weren't as many good moments. Yeah, let's all gather around the bonfire one more time and laugh about Jim the Pole, but the charm has faded and the air has gotten stale.

Dead by Daylight is, without question, one of the most infuriating, poorly balanced, and mentally draining experiences I’ve ever subjected myself to. This game doesn’t just get worse the more you play it actively punishes you for everything in the slightest. Every match feels like a slow descent into a never-ending cycle of frustration where no matter how hard you try, the outcome is suffering.

I've played some games I've struggled with before skill issue or genuinely hard,but nothing compares to the unique agony of Dead by Daylight. It’s a shrine of misery a game where hope dies first, followed by your patience, your sanity, and finally, your will to continue living. The balance is a joke, the matchmaking feels cursed, and every so-called “update” somehow manages break the game entirely. The only entity more cruel than the one within the game is the one behind its design. I’d genuinely rather spend five relentless years of my life working without rest, surviving on nothing but exhaustion and caffeine, than give another ounce of support to this broken,creation or the people who made it.",False,2,10516

and lastly i want to say that we should give behavior more respect cause they deserve this they are doing there hardest to make the game better and fix the issues but instead we just yell at them that they care only about money and they are ruining the game but i like to see the lifetime of this game kinda works like life there are bad times and good times peaks and lows so im not mad that dbd hit a low because that thing happens to many games and im sure that behavior tries their hardest to fix the game issues im sure of it that one day dbd will hit a peak again because behavior do try and care for this game and one of the best things of trying is also failing nothing can be perfect they will make mistakes but pepole do make mistakes its fine to get a bad killer release like skull merchant or a bad update like what happend recently its ok cause they will fix this they will make skull merchant less anoying one day and fix the killer gap problem and tunneling slugging im sure that one time behavior will implement a solution that will be good for all of us and for the game so lets give behavior more respect and treat them better",True,0,44123

Dead by Daylight,381210,207433389,"[h1]Survive in the Fog[/h1]
Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical horror game featuring a killer against 4 survivors.

While this game may be popular, it's fraught with problems, and the more years go by, the worse they get.
The game is in constant development, with the addition of original or licensed characters to purchase and/or unlock in-game every three months on average, with new perks added each time, and usually a new map available for everyone (for free).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3243920817
DbD's strong point is clearly the diversity of gameplay around the killers, the numerous perks and the presence of several popular licensed characters (Ghost Face, Resident Evil, Freddy...)

But unfortunately, the positives end there, because everything else is just frustrating... [b]A company that only apologizes for every mistake they do without actually fixing the issues[/b], bugs everywhere that make playing really difficult during some periods, the graphisms are disgusting and drains a HUGE amount of performance for such low quality, settings worthy of a mobile game with very few in-game customization options, decisions made contrary to what the community expects, balancing issues with maps, killers, and survivor/killer perks...

In short... We can only say that DbD remains popular thanks to 3 factors: licensed characters, frequent content (chapters, skins, etc.), and above all, [b]no real game competitor that would make the community move ![/b]

Even though I've spent a lot of time on this game, [b]DbD remains a game I've given too much[/b], hoping for a better version and fixes over the years, but [b]2025 marks a dead end in my opinion...[/b]

[b]I absolutely do not recommend it, especially for beginners: the game has clearly become frustrating and hardly competitive, making it difficult to have fun especially in solo ![/b]

One of my main games is Overwatch, and I used to play a lot of R6 and League of Legends. Those games are wholesome in comparison to this cesspit.

I started playing this masterpiece at the very start on Playstation 4, then i moved to Playstation 5, and now i just couldn´t give it away on PC. It´s one of my favorite games ever, at least online ones, cause i don´t like to play online that much. 

Everything about it it´s just so catchy, from mechanics, to the stressfull moments it gives us just for free xD. 

I absolutely recommend this to anyone who likes horror in general, and for those who like games that put you on the edge, but allows you to put others in the edge as well. 

It´s one of a kind, a future classic of the genre and for sure one of those games that you just won´t get bored of.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

As a survivor, you walk around until you find a generator, then complete a few quick-time events. If the killer spots you, you’re probably going to get caught or injured, then you just repeat the same loop again.

As the killer, your task is to camp generators or chase down survivors. That’s pretty much it.

I honestly don’t get the hype.

[h2] Community [/h2]

One of the worst communities I’ve seen, full of toxic, tryhard players who take the fun out of it.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]

A very boring, repetitive game with lackluster mechanics and endless quick-time events. The gameplay loop is always the same: run around, find or defend generators, escape or chase, hook or unhook. That’s it. Combine that with a terrible community, and it’s just not worth it.

Dead by Daylight is not just a game — it’s an emotional rollercoaster built entirely out of screams, betrayal, and questionable matchmaking.

One minute you’re a stealth god, looping the killer for five generators straight. The next, you’re face-down on a hook wondering how your teammates managed to hide in the corner for the entire match. It’s beautiful, it’s chaotic, it’s absolutely infuriating… and somehow, you keep coming back.

Each killer feels unique, each survivor has their quirks, and the constant updates keep things fresh — or at least, unpredictable. The mix of strategy, skill, and sheer panic makes every round unforgettable. And when that exit gate finally opens? That’s pure adrenaline.

Sure, there’s balance drama, salty lobbies, and occasional bugs from the Entity itself — but none of that ruins the core magic: the social chaos of four humans versus one monster, and the shared trauma that follows.

🩸 Verdict: 8.5/10 — Equal parts terror and comedy. Whether you’re screaming, sweating, or rage-quitting, Dead by Daylight always gets your heart racing. You never escape — and that’s exactly why it’s brilliant.",True,1,210

Playing Survivor has become a gamble of who's going to get Tunneled first and for me personally dissuades playing in a squad as you'll always have a friend twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do for potentially 10-20 minutes while they wait for the match to be over.  Lesser capable Killers who don't use Meta perks such as myself risk every game being a punching bag to a Bully Squad or Gen-Rushed by a team of Survivors they could just never find.
I hear the development team knows how unfriendly DBD is to beginners, but it's not just the overwhelming amount of Killers with different abilities and Perks with different interactions, but the PLAYERS just as well.  I've seen many times where a Survivor is inadvertently tunneled out of a game because they're not as well knowledged as the rest, and witnessed Killers whom have only JUST downloaded the game absolutely demolished by well-versed Survivors.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207342692,"""Would I recommend Dead by Daylight?""
Absolutely not — but I’ll still be logging in tomorrow.

This game is like an abusive relationship, only with more teabags and even less communication. It pulls you in with promises of fun chases, thrilling escapes, and the occasional dopamine hit when you outsmart a killer, and promises of balancing the game from BHVR. You think, “Maybe it’s different this time. Maybe the playerbase is coming around and getting on the same page that it's supposed to be FUN for all 5 in the lobby."" Then it gaslights you; a killer facecamps you, your teammates sandbag you, and somehow you end up thinking it’s your fault. “If I’d just looped better… if I’d brought Dead Hard or Decisive Strike or Unbreakable... or Lightborn (for the killers)..."" because that's what BHVR and the sweaty players will tell you. But then you get one amazing match where everyone plays fair, you escape through the gate or hatch, and your brain goes, “See? It’s not that bad.” And just like that, you’re back.

917 hours later, here I am. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone I care about — but if you do play, welcome to the support group. We meet in the fog.",False,1,58729

Not only do they not implement the anti tunnel anti camp systems we were promised, but they also allow racists and sexist individuals to run around in their game and their report system means nothing. To fix their game in a meaningful way they need the following:

1. An anti-camp system
2. An anti tunnel system
3. Better matchmaking in general or a comp option 
4. Their report system needs to actually do something because it creates unsafe situations for streamers as is, there should be report feedback so you actually know when someone gets banned
5. They need to actually listen to their community when we make suggestions. Currently they put out surveys like they are but we are very ignored in actuality, these game devs need to play their game on public servers to really understand bc it's clear that they aren't
6. Additional suggestions: 1-2 killers you can blacklist that you wont match make against for those facing trauma with specific killers, a system in the blood web auto selector to filter for a few items when auto webbing, an ""avoid player"" option like Overwatch has for people you block etc so you aren't matched with them again

These are just the tip of the iceberg. I've been a big supporter of DBD and was trying to bring joy to my community, but I can't stream it anymore with all the unsafe people in public chats and matches and the game straight up being not fair. I would like to be brutally destroyed by people with true skills at the game in a way where I'm honored to lose to them. Not racist sexist people who know how to tunnel and camp a hook.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207266906,"What this game does well, it does incredibly so. No other multiplayer horror game can give the highs that DBD can, but also no other game can give such incredibly frustrating lows. Each match is a 50/50 on your enjoyment, but ultimately you keep playing, and if not you'll eventually come back like everyone else does. 

What i recommend is this; don't solely make not dying the thread that holds your enjoyment together, and if your a killer don't make killing every survivor as it either. You get bloodpoints and progression from various things, healing fixing gens evading the killer and so on. (and same for being killer). I know it seems like nonsense but if you just let yourself be immersed and accept you might die (as you would if you played a singleplayer horror game) the vibe of the game changes alot. That's just my take on it though.

yes there are bugs and imbalances and all the mishandling by the devs, but ultimately the game perseveres through it all. and if you play this game you'll learn to persevere as well through all the frustrations and lows because at the end of the day it's just so f**king satisfying when you finally outrun the killer and escape or get all 4 survivors on hook.",True,0,8736

I also have 500 hours as killer , so i now have the pov from both sides, and i can affirm that playing killer is 80% of the time NOT a fun experience, survivors are the biggest crybaby of any games around, they will insult and throw death wishes at you for playing the game how it is intended by the DEVS, its not the people that built this environnement its the devs themselves, the only way for a killer to be able to get a win is to play in the ""toxic"" way, slugging/camping/tunneling/etc...

It does not matter what the problem of bug currently affecting the game is, they will find a way to pinpoint the cause of it, announce that their ""Amazing Development team"" will fix it, brainstorm ideas on the worst possible way they can handle it, and somehow nail it perfect way to make the game worse.

For example, recently they updated the game with a feature that removes ""Giving up"" on hook, basically you cant take a chance to escape without a luck offering, and it doesn't insta kill on the second skill check failure. Now, in their minds this was the grand save-all solution, now no one will EVER give up since they are discouraged to, and will fight till the last breath! What actually happened, however, is now a rage quitter will now be encouraged to sabotage the game, or just go afk instead of being taken out; a generally better solution to the inescapable baby rage that happens so often in this community.

Another thing, they are a perpetrator of the classic ""Release a overpowered character, let people buy it in mass to win, then nerf it to the ground"" trope. Well, that is when the Oh-So great dev team can actually make something good, and not being lazy.

An amazing art team being held hostage by a dev team with an combined iq of 4. And if you don't think they don't play their game, look into what happened to Mathieu Cote when he got humiliated with flashlights on TV.

I mean i do have lots of joyful memories from playing it and even made lots of friends on it, but now i cant even launch it because EAC doesnt wanna initialize apparently? i tried most ""solutions"" (from reinstalling, verifying files, restarting PC/steam to other more detailed processes) that i found from forums and threads online, but nothing helps. also BHVR takes excruciatingly long to even respond to tickets, so dont bother. when i do get a response, its usually automated and honestly borders on brainless. so wow thanks, ill just have to wait a few weeks for any upcoming updates (if those r even gonna help, mind u). heard some people say that factory resetting ur pc should work, i dont doubt it, but i am also NOT wiping everything off of mine just to be able to access a game i paid for, its out of the question. I cannot just manually install fresh EAC on my own for DBD either, because their website does not provide an installer or anything at all. I attempted to use the EAC folder from some other game, because that somehow worked for a few people i talked with, but for me, that was just as useless as anything else i tried before that. 


well but anyway, besides the fact that this whole thing with DBD having endless bugs at all times is blatantly ridiculous on its own, no one should be expected to go to crazy lengths and wait for months for a simple anticheat to run correctly, yet here we are...and if this issue is due to the EAC itself being faulty and not about the DBD devs, then by all means, please excuse me. but then again, i doubt its about the EAC and epic devs themselves, because at the end of the day, the other games that i play which use EAC as well, initialize & work perfectly fine, but okay! btw my actual error message is just a simple ""EAC client cannot be instantiated"" and everything i said above is fully unique to my experience and my pc. 


as for the gameplay or whatever really, i suppose its all fine. for me personally, solo q is unbearable due to how the matchmaking appears to hook multiple people with different skill levels into the same lobbies (im pretty sure that the DBD matchmaking prioritizes fast lobby matching, not so much putting people with similar escape rates together). there has seemingly also been a spike in all the griefing happening in matches, so im not surprised many people just DC, i dont wanna interact with hackers and trolls either, so a team full of friends appears to be the only way to play it rn.",False,253,56282

This [i]Game[/i] has taken 100 hours from me and it took only [b]30 minutes[/b] for me to Finally get it in my head that these [i]Devs[/i] have no idea what they are doing.

""I want to play a normal game for like 12-20 minutes!"" [b]Wrong[/b] it's has been more than 70 seconds since you found a survivor and now 2+ gens are already done by the time you get to one because some of the survivors brought toolkit *Items*, the game will now end in about 3 minutes regardless of any action you take.

""alright! I finally got one! now to bring them to a hook and-"" [b]No.[/b] a survivor WILL be there with a flashlight *item* to stun you out of the grab and they WILL do this the rest of the game Every-time [i]*without fail.*[/i]

""The survivor is right there! i'll hit them and-"" [b]How?[/b] because there's no way you're hitting anything in this near blinding smoke cloud their *item* made, it's also not the last time this will happen because it has [i]Infinite Uses[/i] on a 70-60 second cooldown that they can reduce even further.

""well damn.. oh wait! I can just get a perk that counters *items!* that way I- [b]What perk?[/b] 
""what? the-there HAS to be a perk for this problem!"" 
There [i]was[/i] ""Franklins Demise"" it drops their items on a melee hit and makes them go away after 90 seconds but then they nerfed it when adding the smoke bomb- ""okay?! and?! i'll still use it even if they made the items disappear slower or jus-""
they removed that ""...Fu*king [i]what[/i]"" they. removed. that. feature. and somehow thought that increasing the range that you can see the items was a proper compensation.

""What if I just fu*king killed the problem survivor first? huh? what if i just leave them there to die ground? what if just do that?"" You break [b]The Rules[/b]

""the what?"" the rules, the ones that the same survivors who are making your game experience a waking hell *made-up*, to keep killers ""non-toxic and respectful"" while they play their ""co-op game"", ""rules"" that were *made-up* so survivors can use it as a ""get out of jail free card"" on any consequence from whatever harassment/bullying/hate crime they throw at you, ""rules"" that are now a *base game mechanic* that you are [b]Required[/b] to follow, lest you become unable to undo any progress they make, [b]forever[/b], and that whole ""let them just die on the ground"" thing? Gone, removed from the game entirely, as now they can just pick themselves up after staying on the ground for a *Combined Total* of 90 seconds.

""...did they tone-down or nerf survivors to compensate for this so the game can go slowe-"" [b]Not at fu*king all[/b] 
""Isn't what the survivors were doing achieving the same as what I was going to do?"" [b]Yes[/b]
""Are the Devs going to recognize that?"" [b]Never[/b], because these are the same people who let several bugs found in the Public beta test go to live, and let both of the last two+ major updates seemingly go nowhere near QA.

And it has [b]always[/b] been like this.
And it this problem [b]will[/b] continue until it dies [b]again[/b] and [b]again[/b]
And I do not want more hours from anyone at all to be wasted on this [b]""""Game""""[/b] and it's endless recursive loop of [b]b*llsh*t[/b] and [b]lies[/b]

Dead by Daylight,381210,207150627,"Dead by Daylight, developed by Behaviour Interactive, stands as one of the most thrilling and unique multiplayer horror games ever created. Its concept is simple yet brilliant: four survivors must work together to repair generators and escape, while one killer hunts them down. This asymmetrical 4v1 setup delivers an intense, heart-pounding experience that never feels repetitive, thanks to the game’s dynamic maps, diverse characters, and unpredictable match flow.

One of the strongest aspects of Dead by Daylight is its gameplay variety. Every character, both survivor and killer, offers unique abilities and perks that completely change how matches play out. Whether you’re outsmarting the killer with clever jukes or stalking survivors as a silent predator, the game always manages to keep you on edge. The balance between teamwork and individual skill creates an addictive loop of tension and reward that keeps players coming back for more.

Beyond gameplay, Dead by Daylight also shines in its content model. Players can unlock many characters and cosmetic items for free through gameplay, without needing to spend money. This level of accessibility encourages commitment and fair progression, giving dedicated players the satisfaction of earning their favorite survivors, killers, and skins simply by playing.

The atmosphere and presentation are equally impressive. Each map is beautifully eerie, featuring moody lighting, haunting sounds, and cinematic design that perfectly captures the essence of horror. Combined with an ever-growing roster of original and licensed characters—from classic slasher icons to Behaviour’s own creations—Dead by Daylight offers endless replayability.

Overall, Dead by Daylight is a must-play for fans of horror and multiplayer strategy. Its innovative design, rewarding progression, and sheer intensity make it one of the best and most enduring games in the genre.",True,0,6590

TLDR: The meta is super trash right now with Survivors using sprint burst with the exhaustion cooldown perks and hard gen rushing. Killers are tunneling a lot (Generators are completed so quick they feel like they need a least one kill for the entire match.

Any sense of proper matchmaking is just a facade, coop survivors are ultra unbalanced, and to play killer is just a sweaty stress fest if you are trying to compete in matches against SWFs, Meta-builds, and Gen Rushing (which these are all you get once you have enough time in the game).

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy this game for the most part under the right circumstances, but when the bad parts of the game come out, it's really bad and makes me okay with taking extended breaks from the game until I feel like checking up on it again. I have been limiting my time and money that I am willing to spend on this game.

I really hope one day enough of our player criticism is heard and BHVR actually cares and does something truly meaningful to mend these issues, I know i'm not the only one and that there are plenty of players you feel the same way.

Additional perspective: From a Killers perspective, you are just here to ""chase"" the survivors around as the loop you across the map, complete Generators at high speed, you are here just to give them a sense of challenge, some hooks, maybe a kill or two at best, but just to allow them to have their power fantasy, especially against higher level survivors/teams. And if you happen to get to a good start and frustrate a survivor or two, expect them to immediately disconnect/throw the game.  If the matchmaking decides to swing too far in the other direction, you'll feel bad for dominating players who are obviously below average and probably just them go if you're nice. The Devs have even stated that they want this type of matchmaking ratio, which is obvious cope for an inability to actually balance the game and matchmaking. 

From survivors perspective, if you are in a sweaty gen-rushing meta perk pre-running tryhard squad then see above; for everyone else, expect to play against the most desperate bitter traumatized killers ever! Whoever gets the first hook is going to get tunneled out of the game ASAP, they will be so desperate for that early kill to slow down the probable gen-rushing. If you are teamed up with randoms, they'll just be running around the map like chickens with their heads cut off, leaving you to be the last survivor alive if you are competent and not tunneled... but what is your reward? To get slugged, left crawling on the floor while the Killer moves back and forth behind you in a humping motion insinuating Rape, until you bleed out, yes this happens a lot!",False,0,127618

Dead by Daylight,381210,207139860,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. I have been playing on console from 2017 until late last year so off steam i have at least 4000 hours. To be blunt, it is a really, really bad game, and it has been for the last 3 years. The majority of players who rot in their gaming chairs and play this all day suck, the complete jokes they call events suck, the recent rifts suck and will continue to worsen, the gameplay elements or lack there of suck and lastly the cosmetics given often suck.

BHVR has such an avid incompetence with bugs that release every new update that stack on the pre-existing 300 other bugs they had prior that it takes months and even years for a glimmer of hope that they fix one of them unless it's utterly game breaking. Gameplay wise, it is extremely boring and repetitive and has offered NOTHING new since release besides TIME-LIMITED gameplay modes they decide to bless us with once every 6 months. It is so painfully boring and hopeless unless you have a SWF, since there is no way to communicate with teammates. 

The ENTIRE player base—I cannot stress this enough are gut wrenchingly awful at the game, they do NOT value the fun of others if they're playing killer, they do NOT care if you live or not if they're on your team as survivor and on top of that they are quite literally the worst people you can possibly meet and interact with. 

(It is not the community's job to make sure players on either party has fun, I'd just like to note that 90% of the matches you will play will equal that to medieval torture since the game literally feeds off of raw, violent, soul sucking toxicity in order to thrive.)

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME, especially for new players. It is 100% NOT new-player friendly; there is an overwhelming mass amount of killers with an amalgamation of new or reused powers in different forms, and honestly don't even bother with learning a killer's power because if enough surv players whine about it, they get the power completely rewritten even after release.
There are 282 perks most of which suck and aren't even worth using, 61 maps that are either unfun on killer or unfun or survivor and overall aesthetically unpleasing. Not to mention hundreds of map tiles/loops you HAVE to learn to even stand a chance in a match despite the fact they are not in the slightest explained in the AWFUL AND OUTDATED tutorial they refuse to change. 
Every month the game receives a new killer with a new indescribably complicated power that is usually an amalgamation of prior killers bunched together in an attempt to make something new (if we're lucky we also get another ugly map no one wants to look at) and 3-6-9 perks that are either; complete utter trash no one is going to use, or insanely broken and instantly become a new extremely powerful meta on already broken killers.

If you want to get into this game, make sure to isolate yourself from the outside world because there is no other asym out there that is even considered a competitor in the slightest involved in the genre, so you stick to this awful game in hopes that the devs will pick themselves up and fix it, which they never will because the code is disgraceful and again, BHVR sucks so you end up in a non-stop cycle of playing this game PURELY because there is no other game similar to it and BHVR are acutely aware of that, it's exactly why they can get away with the sheer unwavering stupidity as a company and objectively lackluster content they offer us.


The cosmetics we do get for killers and survs are typically so overdone with neon glowing colors, ugly patterns and unnecessary accessories in the strangest places that in the end they look like a ""Name one thing in this image"" meme. overall 70% of the NEW outfits in the game are a complete mess with horrendously absurd themes and a generous amount of vomit inducing millenialness to the point the idea of someone buying them is literally absurd to me.
If you find yourself enjoying a less popular character you will most likely not get an outfit for months or even an entire year, so good luck with that because they prioritise making outfits and emblems, banners and charms for the skinny white women in the game such as Sable Ward over literally anyone else.

But hey, if it goes on sale for 5 bucks, then sure, buy it and mess around in it because the game can somehow be really fun at times, especially with friends. It just really sucks that the biggest pain in this game is that mostly it is a pure gamble whether or not you want to tear your teeth free from your skull at the end of a match, but in my opinion, SAVE YOURSELF, because this game has at least 2-3 years left of life and it isn't worth getting into.",False,1,21733

It’s one of those games that can give you the best gaming moments — and then immediately make you want to uninstall.

Fair warning: this is easily in my Top 3 Hardest Games to Get Into, right behind Escape from Tarkov and any Paradox games. There’s almost no tutorial, and the learning curve is steep. The devs rely heavily on content creators to teach new players how the game actually works. So if you’re looking to just buy it and instantly have fun… be ready to lose, learn, lose again, and then start having fun.

My tip: if you can get one or two friends with the same mindset, do it. DBD shines when you play and learn together. It’s a fantastic game that constantly rewards you for improving and experimenting — the core mechanics are simple, but surprisingly tough to master.",True,0,55610

It’s not just bad—it’s a psychological experiment disguised as entertainment. Survivors and killers alike behave like escaped NPCs from a cursed simulation, and honestly, I respect their commitment to chaos. But the real monster here? The game’s balancing, which was clearly designed by someone who can't stand upright.

Every match feels like a rerun of a nightmare. Survivors cling to the same perks like they’re life vests on the Titanic, while killers show up with the same loadouts like they’re attending a cosplay convention for sociopaths. Variety? Creativity? Those were sacrificed to the dark gods of meta. It’s like watching two arsonists argue over who gets to burn down the house first—while they’re both inside it.

The game needs both sides to function, yet both sides are keen on making the other's life as miserable as they can. It’s less “multiplayer horror” and more “mutual psychological warfare.”

Thinking of playing? Great! Just make sure your therapist is on speed dial. The in-game tutorial teaches you about as much as a fortune cookie written by a sleep-deprived raccoon. You’ll need YouTube guides, a support group, and a fuckton of alcohol.

Dead by Daylight,381210,207073846,"You know, I've had longstanding opinion that PvP games have suffered from the common issue of players and developers alike assuming that bad sportsmanship and the zero-sum nature of the game are both not only inevitable, but necessary factors. Entirely too many people chase the wild goose that is balance, without affording any thought as to whether or not their game would even be fun were they to achieve the impossible. ""Have any of them wondered,"" I ask myself, ""if a 50% winrate truly feels like a 50% winrate?""

Games like Dead by Daylight help answer this conundrum for me. Here it is, standing out from the crowd; unlike most other game's I've played, this one is separate from them all, different to its core. It sits me down, leans over, and whispers sweetly into my ears: ""You're completely fucking right actually! I hate people."" Then it clubs me over the head and offers to sell me a fashionable bandage for $5.

Leave aside the issues of a horrible and punishing new player experience. Leave aside the richly awful new privacy policy. Do not worry yourself about the game's obsession with DLC and microtransactions, or the fact that interesting gameplay alterations are deliberately and pointlessly locked to time-limited events designed to generate a fear-of-missing-out. All of this pales by comparison.

This thing could scarcely be a better tool for engendering bitterness in its playerbase if it had been specifically engineered to do so. Every game, win or lose, ends up feeling like a hurdle that took something from you. The only people who truly thrive in this environment are the kind who specifically come to spit in the face of others—I ask someone why they enjoy playing Survivor, a role I find stressful and impossible, and you know what I was told? ""I like to show killers their place."" Call me crazy, but I don't think rampant mutual antagonism is a very healthy relationship for players to have with each other.

The role of a game designer is to create a mechanism by which players can explore various emotions. Frustration is a valid one, as games like Getting Over It have proved. But those were deliberate. This? This is callous negligence. As any other review can tell you, the toxicity is rampant. And I can't even blame people for it! How could I, when the game seems designed to [i]teach you[/i] to seek revenge on others and treat them as awfully as possible? I suppose it's at least on-brand for a game about a bunch of merciless bastards, if nothing else.

I feel bad for myself, because of the energy I've lost on games that made my day worse. I feel bad for other players, for having found an environment so rancid it ends up making them venomous just to feel sane. I feel bad for the players who I managed to thoroughly beat, since I know it's likely they had an awful time facing me. And I feel bad for my friends, who hoped that I could have fun playing this; though they too have left negative reviews, so at least I can know they will understand.

Mark my words, this game will never fix itself. Not because it can't be - the concept could be great, if enough work were done to fix it - but because Behavior Interactive is not interested in doing that. They're making money off of people, and that's all that matters. Considering this, and all the pain this game is prone to causing, I can recommend trying this game only in some hypothetical context wherein the publisher loses more money off you than they gain. No game that breeds this much hate deserves to turn a profit.

A word spared for the kind, though: There are a few occasions, and a few players, who when playing Killer will grant you leniency. They will not chase you relentlessly, thus giving you a chance to accomplish something. They will limit how many people they kill, so that at least some survivors can have a win. And especially as a new player, this was wonderful, and win or lose I enjoyed my time with them. Though it can't make up for the tremendous issues embedded in this game's execution, I greatly appreciate their considerate actions.",False,0,1776

Dead by Daylight,381210,207073438,"Dead by Daylight – Fun, Frustrating, and Somehow Addicting
This review is completely unbiased, just my honest take after years of playing.

I started playing Dead by Daylight around 2022, so I’m just judging it based on my own experience. From the moment I jumped in, I found it to be a game that constantly swings between “this is amazing” and “why am I still playing this?” It’s tense, unpredictable, and unique, but it also has plenty of moments that make you want to take a break and then come back again.

Pros:
- Unique gameplay: There’s really nothing else like it. The 4v1 setup keeps every match different and unpredictable. They even recently tested a 2v8 mode that was actually a lot of fun, though it was only limited-time. It’s nice to see the devs experimenting with new ideas.

- Atmosphere: The sound design and overall tension are really well done, especially early on. The heartbeat mechanic and creepy visuals make the first few hours feel intense. But if you’re looking for a true horror experience, you’ll probably be disappointed. The fear factor fades pretty quickly once you get used to the gameplay, and it becomes more about strategy and skill than actual scares.

- Frequent updates: New killers, survivors, and maps drop often enough to keep things fresh, even if balance can feel off sometimes.

- Crossovers: The licensed killers and survivors from franchises like Resident Evil and Silent Hill are done really well and add a lot of variety.

- Cross-platform play: You can play with friends no matter what platform they’re on, PC, console, or even next-gen systems. It makes it easy to connect with your friends and keeps the community alive across all platforms.

- Skill expression: Both sides reward game sense and experience. Pulling off a good chase or clutch escape actually feels earned.

- Active dev support: The developers host a lot of events throughout the year with bonus bloodpoints, cosmetics, and limited-time rewards. They also give out compensation when the servers go down or maintenance takes longer than expected, which is always appreciated. Some events are recycled, but they still give players something to work toward.

- Discounts: The game itself and the DLCs go on sale pretty often, so if you’re patient, you can pick up killers, survivors, and even the base game at really good discounts instead of paying full price.

Neutral:
- Experience depends on friends: The game can be a blast if you play with friends and coordinate, but solo queueing can be rough. Bad teammates, toxic players, and inconsistent matchmaking can make it frustrating when you’re on your own. I recommend finding a group of people who are already experienced and don’t mind playing with newer players, as this can make the experience much more enjoyable.

Cons:
- Matchmaking: It’s hit or miss. Some games are really fun and balanced, others feel completely one-sided.

- Bugs and performance issues: It’s better than it used to be, but bad hit registration, lag, and rubberbanding still happen more than they should.

- Toxic players: Easily one of the worst parts of the game. The community can be extremely toxic on both sides. As killer, you’ll get teabagged, flashlight-clicked, body-blocked, and spammed with insults in post-game chat just for playing normally. As survivor, you’ll deal with killers who camp and tunnel from the start, or teammates who rage quit and leave you to die. It’s not every game, but it happens a lot. You’ll need a thick skin and a sense of humor to deal with it because it’s almost part of the experience at this point.

- Learning curve and meta: The game doesn’t explain much, so most players learn through trial and error or guides. On top of that, Dead by Daylight has a very defined meta for both survivors and killers. If you don’t adapt quickly to the most effective strategies, perks, and playstyles, you’ll likely struggle and get frustrated. It rewards players who study and follow trends, which can make it tough for newcomers or anyone who prefers a more casual, experimental approach.

- Grind with little reward: After prestige 3, there isn’t much reason to keep leveling a character except for cosmetics. It starts to feel like you’re grinding with little to nothing to show for it.

- Licensed content isn’t permanent: Some killers and survivors are tied to licensing deals and can be removed. The good news is the devs always alert players ahead of time when that happens, so you’ll have a fair chance to buy or unlock them before they’re gone for good.

- Pay-to-win elements: Some DLC characters come with very strong perks that can change the game. You can unlock most original characters with in-game currency, but licensed ones require real money. It makes things tougher for new players who don’t want to spend extra.

Final Thoughts: Dead by Daylight is a love-hate kind of game. When it’s good, it’s some of the most fun and intense multiplayer you can play. When it’s bad, it’s frustrating enough to make you want to uninstall. But no matter how many times I take a break, I always end up coming back. It’s chaotic, stressful, and sometimes unfair, but it’s also addicting.

Okay, I can handle them changing the game into a chase-only experience and nerfing the stealth mechanics for survivors. I can even handle killers being the largest group of sweaty underachievers who rely on the Ghoul to point-and-click instead of using skill, like Dead-Slinger or Krause, which removes the learning curve and guesswork.

But the current event offers no incentive for killers to play. Sweaty, aggressive play has become commonplace, and the fun factor is close to nonexistent compared to what it used to be. Save your money, play Identity V instead. The only remaining draw in DBD is having a good group of friends or streaming on Twitch. Neither of which make DBD a requirement.

It's ridiculous what's going on right now - The developers simply don't have the courage to implement the changes they announce... It's no longer fun at the moment. 90% of Killers I face are tunneling to the fullest.

As a killer it always feel too easy, like you always in control of a situation, and can allow people to win against you or not. And there always could happen a moment in the game when you hited several survivors in a short period of time, or downed two at once, or killed one, after which there's no challenge at all, you know people will not be able to do gens, but they also will try hide, so the game takes longer, but there's not intrigue it. And you always play with one person, as the game really punish survivors if they play together with a killer, and not sitting at the gen.

As a survivor it requires mach more skills, you mast know layout of every single map to not make a wrong turn and not appear in the dead end, and this game really doesn't forgive mistakes. Also the main part of the gameplay - doing gens, is just boring. You just seat for minutes pressing single button and that's all. Of course you can try to do something else, but it will not make you win. Another minus is most of the perks are absolutely useless.

Owning it on PC also gives you access to chat before game ( with survivors )  and after game ( with survivors and killer ) You can also vote if your team mates were good at the end of game with a thumbs up and thumbs down icon. Now about the game in more detail. It’s a  multiplayer game which has 4 survivors vs 1 killer . ( There are events that are limited time throughout the year that’s 8 survivors vs 2 killers ) The main goal of the game is to repair generators, avoid getting caught,  hooked and killed by the killer while trying to escape .This game is one of those games where you get into it and you love/ hate it down the line.  The game does have a bit of bugs not going to lie . Some of the good perks are behind characters you have to buy ( not that I mind but some people might care as some people think the game paid to win ) Not to worry though as some characters you can unlock by playing the game and getting shards.  I wouldn’t say the game is beginner friendly as you can get into a game with anyone from any level. I will say if you play as Sable there a 50/50 chance you’d be tunnelled more by the killer and team mates  help you less. This is because most new players pick Sable  ( and of course when you start a game you aren’t the best and don’t know what’s going on  ) and people just have an issues with the character because of this . I still love Sable though  :) This game may be a horror game but personally to me I find it fun not to many jump scares and there a lot of silly people on here .

BHVR has been promising to fix things since the release the Quality of Life Initiative yet here we are — no real improvements, and somehow it’s getting worse. They even had the audacity to drop a repeat event again, paired with an absolutely horrendous Rift Pass. To make things worse, we’re apparently not getting a new Rift for 110 days and no new content until January. That’s nearly four months of literal neglect in a live-service game.

Tunneling is at an all-time high, and despite the PTB showing potential solutions (during The Krasue testing), none of that has been rolled out. As a killer main, I felt the only real issue was the anti-slugging measures — everything else would’ve been a step in the right direction.

And yet, the devs think they’re doing great. The game director recently called Sinister Grace (The Krasue chapter) a ""success"", which is mind-blowing. It could’ve been a strong release — maybe even close to All Things Wicked (Sable & The Unknown) — but instead, we got an overtuned killer right after what felt like modern days version of the bubonic plague.. The Ghoul

Let’s not even talk about player retention. The tutorials, even after being updated, are still trash. They do nothing to help a new player actually learn how to play. You’re basically expected to feel like an idiot for the first 500 hours unless:

Dead by Daylight,381210,206983566,"3,382 Hours as a Claudette Main – Still One of the Most Unique Multiplayer Experiences

After 3,382 hours in Dead by Daylight, mostly spent crouching in bushes and healing teammates as Claudette, I can confidently say this game is still one of the most intense, frustrating, and satisfying multiplayer titles out there.

What keeps me hooked after all this time is the pure adrenaline. Every match is a mind game. As a Claudette main, I’ve learned to thrive in the shadows—sneaking past Killers, clutch-saving teammates, and outwitting some of the most brutal foes gaming has to offer. Whether I’m solo queuing or running a full SWF squad, DBD always delivers those unforgettable “last second escape” moments.

The game has grown massively since I started—new Killers, perks, reworks, and collaborations keep it fresh. Behavior’s commitment to expanding the universe, especially with unique licensed content, gives it unmatched personality. Claudette may be one of the originals, but she’s still as viable and stealthy as ever.

Yes, there are issues. Matchmaking can be inconsistent. Meta perks rise and fall. And yes, camping and tunneling still exist. But for every frustrating match, there’s one that reminds me why I’ve stayed this long.

If you enjoy psychological gameplay, high-stakes stealth, and don’t mind a bit of chaos, Dead by Daylight is absolutely worth your time. Just don’t underestimate that Claudette crouching in the grass—you might not see her, but she’s the reason you didn’t bleed out.",True,0,202918

Every trial is nearly the same scenario, over and over and over over. The micro-transactions could not be more blatant. If you are playing as a Survivor, then it's just dying simulator, unless you are sweaty as hell and blind the killer every few seconds with a flashlight, then you're cooked. This means that if you are beginner, then it's just insanity - the same thing over and over with little to no difference, you will just keep dying and it becomes so depressing and unplayable. If you are a killer, then you have to dodge sweaty survivors flashing you every few seconds, it's so bad that sometimes I can't even hook survivors because one of their buddies is always there ready with a flashlight to save the day. The Survivors in this game are often the most sweatiest players on Earth, they will wait at the exit gate for you so they can rub your loss in your face, along with other things. Combine these two together with bad maps, killer sided and survivor sided games and you have the abomination that is 'Dead By Daylight'. I often contemplate why I spent $11.50 on this stupid game that my friends rarely play but make me download, and sometimes I regret it. Don't buy this stupid waste of time, go do something better that is actually beneficial for your health and that makes you happy - because the only thing this game is going to do is waste your time, make you get sweaty, make you unhappy and stress you out. 4/10, if it wasn't so infuriating and actually fun then it would be higher.",False,1,6406

Dead by Daylight,381210,206955559,"This game is good. I am done with people with so many hours saying it's a trash game. I've played since 2016 and watched this game grow from a small 1-2 killer game to the absolute 4v1 empire that still stands. I was a huge fan of evolve when it first came out. But when it died, there was a void that needed to be filled. In came Dead By Daylight. I was surprised by how fast it was growing, especially with the jump from the release of the Nurse, to the release of Myers. Now, do people enjoy it? Depends. Do you like 4v1 gameplay? Knowing that maps are going to stay relatively the same? With the gameplay being the change depending on survivor, killer, perk, and offering varieties? Then you would maybe enjoy it. I'm not saying this game is perfect, by any means. But if I have 800 hours in the game or more, coming back during periods of time enjoying the game, then I am gonna recommend it. 

   Now there is work to be done, I won't lie. Patches for bugs and quality of life changes have been discussed by Behavior. As well as a little cramming with chapters and quality of life however, and I do hope they slow down their pace. If they keep smashing things together, there are going to be issues.

Survivors have been nerfed to the ground with little viable versatile perks & equipment. Developers need to 1. Revert sprint speed & bonus speed from exhaustion perks. 2. Add a game chat to survivors. 3. No survivor perks should be disabled at endgame. 4. Fixed the maps since most are killer sided maps with little to work with without meta perks. 5. Destroy clutter in maps that have no collision but cause collision especially from loops. 6. No stun on drop from high places for survivors (no reason half of balanced landing to be reduced drop stun. Basically revert your game back to year 3 & make good adjustments from there.

I've been playing since release & the game never had a good point through its whole existence. In addition devs need a ranked game mode which bans killers from having more then one aura perk, Iron grasp & Lightborn should be perma banned from this game mode. Same for survivor no more then 1 perk per category. Event game modes should ban meta killers & meta perks for survivors since its a casual game mode.

Gameplay and controls are simple, I find them easier to get used to on here rather than on console. The support team lacks but the game makes up for it. There's a lot of bugs here and there especially after updates, but they're usually funny shit like audio bugs and visual effects.

The cosmetics aren't pricy, which I can appreciate especially with how items are priced in games like Fortnite and Valorant these days. A good DLC will run you $7-$12 but you get new killers and/or survivors and unlock different perks to style different loadouts. Plus you can earn currency for free to purchase any unlicensed killers/survivors and cosmetics but it does take some time. 

Other than all of that its a super fun game to play with friends, but solo queue can be nuts because although it is definitely a game that requires some sort of communication between teams, there's no form of chatting besides before and after matches.

Dead by Daylight,381210,206831810,"For anyone considering buying or getting into the Dead by Daylight universe/fog:

As a player who started in 2019 (around Oni's release) and has nearly 3,300 hours in this game, if asked whether Dead by Daylight is worth purchasing, my answer is no. I recommend saving your money. In my view, Behaviour has damaged Dead by Daylight to the extent that selling the game might be the only way to save it. The developers' repeated apologies for their mistakes have become a laughing stock within the community. I can easily list more negatives than positives, and I will do so. This opinion is based on my personal experience, as well as opinions from other players and content creators.

Engine Source:
--------------------
Dead by Daylight uses spaghetti code in almost everything which causes several bugs to happen such as animation bugs, cosmetic bugs, gameplay bugs, ect. It gets to the point where its frustrating to even play the game when you have to encounter it. Even when they release updates, new bugs often appear, suggesting they don't thoroughly test or care about their own game.

Balancing (-->Non-Existent<--):
----------------
Maps - All maps in DBD are unbalanced due to two main factors: map generation and the killer being played as or against. As a survivor, your chances of winning or losing can depend on the killer's tier (S-Tier or F-Tier) and map generation, specifically the abundance or scarcity of pallets and tiles. Similarly, as a killer, map generation can significantly impact your effectiveness, for example like Myers or Trapper who are weak, if the map is survivor-sided with numerous pallets and windows. Ultimately, the game's maps are designed to be unbalanced, regardless of whether you play as a survivor or a killer.

Survivor Items - Some items for survivor has positive and negatives that could dictate how a match could end in a win or a loss. For example, toolboxes with the addon's scraps and wire spool that can give you 52 charges (half a gen repair) or Brand-New-Part that can turn the tides of a match. Other items like Fog Vials are a complete joke and a useless item you can bring that will have little to 0 impact on a match. Same goes with flashlights which the main use is for flashlight saves (unless killer is facing a wall) then its really a useless item. 

Killers - When looking at Dead by Daylight (DBD) killer tier lists online, opinions on who is S-Tier (strong) versus F-Tier (weak) vary widely. However, the developers often don't prioritize balancing lower-tier killers (e.g., The Hag, The Trapper, Ghost Face) to make them stronger, nor do they sometimes frequently nerf strong killers (e.g., The Nurse, The Blight), despite community requests. A well-balanced killer offers a dynamic back-and-forth in a match, with clear counter-play options for survivors. For example, The Unknown, The Demogorgon, and The Dredge are often considered balanced. They can be strong, depending on the map, but survivors have effective ways to counter them

 Killer Add-ons - Some to many Dead by Daylight add-ons are ineffective or redundant, making them not worth using. For example, The Ghost Face's ""Knife Belt Clip"" add-on, which reduces his terror radius while crouching, is useless as he can already completely suppress his terror radius. Similarly, The Doctor's add-ons that modify his Shock Therapy cone into a hollowed ring or small beam are widely considered poorly designed and impractical. While Behaviour has undertaken add-on reworks before, these efforts sometimes involve unnecessary nerfs rather than beneficial buffs or reworks.

Perks - The imbalance of perks in Dead by Daylight leads to a prevalent 'meta' for both Survivors and Killers. A significant issue is the overlap of perks, rendering some obsolete or less effective in builds.
For perks that overlap one another:

Survivor:
- Quick & Quiet and Cut-lose (both makes your vaults quiet but Cut-Lose has a Longer cooldown)
- Empathic Connection and Empathy (These are opposite when it comes to seeing auras)
- Do no Harm/we'll make it and Resurgance (Do No Harm/We'll Make It applies to healing over hook, while Resurgence literally gives you 70% heal when you come off)

Killer: 
- Ravenous and Hex: Haunted Grounds (Both provide exposed status for 60 seconds with different conditions) 
- Save the Best for Last and Help Wanted (Different conditions but same reward of reduced attack cooldown) 
- Call of Brine and Hex: Ruin (Both Provide 150% gen regression but Ruin can deactivate if cleansed while Call of Brine does not)

Do i need to go on?? Besides the overlapping perks, there are the ""meta"" perks. These Perks are what you see in almost 90% of games you play. Perks like:
- Decisive Strike
- Unbreakable
- Sprint burst
- Vigil 
- Dead Hard
- Pain Resonance
- Surge 
Everyone plays to win; there's no casual gameplay or fun in DBD, only competition. Many perks are rarely seen in matches because they're either useless, underrated, or unnecessary for the current game state. To name a few...
- Septic Touch
- Spies from the Shadows
- Territorial Imperative  
- Beast of Prey 
- Insidious
BHVR's perk reworks often lead to them becoming either meta or trash, rarely inbetween. Take Springtrap's perk, Haywire, for example. It went from regressing the gates to 50% minimal in the PTB to regress the gates to 80% minimal in the live build. This change, affecting exit gates, was unnecessary. A better approach, in my opinion, would have been to make it a hex perk, ""Hex: Haywire,"" keeping the 50% minimal regression but requiring survivors to cleanse a totem to deactivate the gates regressing.

I don't believe i have to explain more on how poorly design the perk system for dbd is, especially on how perks can lead to the meta or the trashcan based on design and impact it has on the match.

Community:
--------------------------------------------
Dead by Daylight is characterized by a toxic back-and-forth between survivors and killers, like disagreements turn violence. Survivors often engage in behaviors like flashlight clicking, 'teabagging,' and sending insulting post-game chat messages or hateful Steam wall comments. Killers reciprocate with actions such as mass slugging, 'W&S' (""Get F*ed"" on downed survivors), unnecessary tunneling, and hitting survivors on the hook, alongside hateful post-game messages. The developer's don't really monitor post-game chat for such toxic behavior most of the time. This is only one side of DBD. The other side of DBD can include cringeworthy profiles of OC's shipping with DBD characters, Tournament DBD players (which can sometimes lead to killers dodging lobbies), and P100 characters in bio's (which doesn't necessarily mean you're good at the game), among other things I won't discuss here.

Ik there is more to be said for example with matchmaking, cheaters, Quality of life “improvements”, No casual Gameplay, Ultimately, Dead by Daylight is a game that is built on toxicity and unbalanced mechanics that will cause you to lose your sanity and not want to play the game anymore.

The devs keep updating the game with new content, events, and quality of life improvements, which shows they really care about the community. Sure, there are some bugs here and there, but overall the game is incredibly fun and addicting.

Dead by Daylight,381210,206737307,"People may call you a Camper, Tunneler, Gen-rusher, or Toxic player but most of this comes from frustration. Here’s what’s really happening in these situations and how both Survivors and Killers can reduce that frustration.

SURVIVORS
We’ve all said it: “You’re camping,” “You’re tunneling,” “OP perks,” “You suck.” These come from feeling powerless or targeted. But instead of blaming, it’s worth understanding why these things happen and how to counter them.

CAMPING

A killer sitting on a hook for the full 2 minutes feels awful. But camping is actually a huge mistake for the killer.

• A survivor takes 120 seconds to die on hook.
• One survivor doing a gen takes ~80 seconds (~100 with Ruin).
• So if the killer camps, do gens instead of going for risky saves.

If a killer fully camps a first hook, you can finish about 3 gens. If they camp again, that’s 2 more. A camping killer realistically caps out at about 2 kills max and earns very few points. When you punish camping with gen pressure instead of feeding more hooks, killers eventually learn it doesn’t work.

TUNNELING

Getting tunneled is miserable, but it's often set up by survivor mistakes that the killer simply capitalizes on.

Killers prioritize:

• The closest targets
• Injured survivors
• Survivors who are already hooked (best value for slowdown and pressure)

If the killer is near the hook when the unhook happens, they will naturally return—there are guaranteed survivors there, one of them injured.

To reduce tunneling:

•Don’t unhook in the killer’s terror radius unless it’s absolutely necessary.
•If the killer never leaves the hook, it's camping/proxy camping—so leave and do gens.
•Communicate with teammates: unsafe unhooks cause tunneling.
•Learn to punish killers through pressure, not insults.",True,0,16296

I used to play almost every single day with my friends or alone, but now i play just one or two matches every now and then. 
   Getting into the game can feel addictive and it's a lot of fun, but the more you play the more you realize  what's wrong with the game. The biggest thing being for me personally: with all the bugs, the unbalanced game mechanics/ perks/ characters, and the number of hackers i've run into, this feels like it should be a FREE GAME. Combine that with all the skins and cosmetics I've earned/ bought, and the standard $20 price tag... definitely should be free lol. Definitely buy this game on a good sale- wouldn't recommend it at full price. I kind of regret all the money i've spent in this game because now I avoid it for the sake of my sanity.  Beware.

It's just not fun anymore solo survivor is the most miserable experience you get BM'd on the ground or slugged the entire game most of the time while at 5 gens. The only way you have fun is in a swf or playing killer to which makes the game easy or enjoyable. I don't understand the disconnect to playing survivor and killer in the community. I enjoy playing both sides but shouldn't be able to get a 4k consistently after not playing killer for 3 months. I genuinely think that some tweaks need to be adjusted to the continued slugging in the game to make the game more enjoyable.

Dead by Daylight,381210,206683437,"Dead by Daylight is in an extremely sad state right now, I gathered up the courage to start playing this year after watching multiple YT videos on it since its release. After 200 hours this game gives me headaches especially if you're playing to have a casually match or just enjoy yourself. There's toxic players on both sides. Sweaty Killers just there to ruin the match by camping, tunneling, slugging or a combination of the 3. Survivor working with the killer or purposely throwing the match. As a survivor main i feel like changes need to be made on both sides. There shouldn't be any survivor/killer sided maps. Maps need to balance so whether you're killer or survivor you have a fair chance at achieving your goal. More pallets will not resolve the issue this just allows the game to become more survivor sided, make resources scarce but also place them smartly so its not a 10 second chase nor a 5 minute chase. The DC recognition system should be better to detect loss of connection vs someone actually pressing a button to quit the game. I shouldn't receive a matchmaking ban due to easy anti cheat detecting whatever it detects. I promise you i don't need to cheat to actually win. Perks need to be reworked on both sides, most of the survivor perks are useless and some killer perks are so OP that you never stood a chance in winning the matches. Item add-ons should be more simpler and compacted into 3 or 5 add-ons per item at least for survivors. Ranked matches should be a thing, I shouldn't have matches with survivors who just opened the game for the 1st time nor should I have a killer with thousands of hours compared to my 218 hours. The game needs a better tutorial explains the game in a more detailed way. Hit boxes and collision needs serious rework i shouldn't get stuck on barriers thats doesn't exist in the middle of chase as well as be hit by an hatchet after being clear of a window vault. This is all i could think about now i'll probably add more over time. I suggest devs shut down the server for a couple months to fix long standing issues and bugs but, hey thats just my opinion.",False,1,14897

Dead by Daylight,381210,206680507,"Going to finally make a review for this game. Been playing for years on console before later coming on PC. Right off the bat, I'm going to say this; The game, right now, currently, is dogshit. Absolutely terrible. The developers have absolutely ZERO clue on what they're doing. If you're new and looking to try it, I recommend NOT to at all. Don't even give them a single dime. Why? Because they're ruining the game slowly. ""Ruining"" is an understatement. The killer role in this game just isn't the power role at all, when it's supposed to be. If you're thinking you're gonna load into a match and stomp survivors as your favorite horror license, think again. The devs give the survivor side WAY too much power and it's pathetic. All because survivors whine everytime they have to go against something strong in a PVP game. It's bullshit. Survivors get: Base kit perks, second chances galore, 100+ pallets all in close proximity to each other, making it almost impossible to get downs if you're not blight or nurse (the strongest killers in the game, but even they feel bad to play because it's just boring.)  Survivors always get what they ask for, always complaining, always whining how every nerf to a killer isn't enough, because how else are they gonna bully the killer for their twitch content? What a joke this game is becoming. They've butchered the killer role: Constantly nerfing killers to near or unplayable for some killers (Most, actually) Gen kick limits exist too now. Don't play the game as killer, you'll hurt the survivors feelings. They added a anti-facecamp feature too. Even though if you do facecamp, you have a much higher precentage of losing anyway, but nerf it I guess, get rid of it. ""Its boring!"" They also leave the weaker killers down in the dirt, in the deepest caves and don't do anything about them. Instead of making all killers viable and fun to actually play, they focus on making bright rainbow unicorn skins, nerfing more bs survivors whine about, and say they're doing a ""pretty good job so far.""  Anytime a new killer releases that's a little bit strong, they're gone in a week. They're made weak so survivors can have their easy wins. A brute, monstrous killer like nemesis for example; what stops him? Oh, a piece of wood. Meanwhile the survivor on the other end is just t-bagging you and there's not a damn thing you can do about it.


The survivor role however is just as boring but less. It's WAY easier than killer. Don't even let anyone convince you otherwise. All survivor gameplay is: Hold M1 on gen till done, repeat 5 times, get chased, throw pallet, vault window. But chases are pretty fun, and that's the only good part about the survivor role. They need to give survivors new objectives I feel. Maybe a way to find generator parts or something. More interactive stuff. Because right now, the only things survivors get are: Gens and totems. The other garbage part about survivor is hoping you get good teammates if you're playing alone. Because there have been SO many times where I've died because of a idiotic teammate doing god knows what or why. 


And the #1 thing that makes this game horrid to play is the community. This community is on a whole other level of horrible. They're toxic, horrible human beings some of them (Not all of them of course), but a big amount. You'll get death threats for simply playing the killer. Because you killed them in a way that doesn't meet their standards. Because you played a certain way. Because you did this, you did that, etc, etc, etc. Same goes if you play survivor, too. You do one wrong thing as survivor and you'll get flamed to all hell for it. This game is NOT beginner friendly at all. 


Last thing I wanna warn you about is: The new user experience. It's really bad as well. The tutorial does NOT teach you nearly enough information. It doesn't tell you about different killers powers. It doesn't even teach you looping (Though you can play against a killer bot in the tutorial, but it doesn't teach you looping at all. You're just kinda thrown in there) And it barely teaches anything for killer as well. It only teaches you how to hit and hook survivor. That's basically it. Doesn't teach you intermediate or advanced stuff, doesn't tech you a few other killers powers so the player can decide who they want to learn, it's just not great. But the worse part about starting new? The grind. It's currently horrbile as well. There is so many perks locked behind a paywall, and everyone's excuse is ""Oh, just way for the shrine of secrets""  If you don't know what it is, it's a set of 4 perks that changes weekly. You can buy any of the perks that appear on there for shards. The problem is, is that you need to wait an entire week in hopes of the perk you want to appear. Otherwise, you gotta pay. They need to have some sort of store with ALL of the perks available to purchase instead of a weekly refresh. Another big issue is shards. You barely earn them as is, and cosmetics, the ones that aren't for just money, costs 7200 a piece. No, not for the whole outfit, the one piece. For example, let's say you want a outfit for dwight. You'd have to grind so much shards which takes way WAY too long, They are absolutely allergic to giving more shards for some reason. You SHOULD be able to earn them every match and in way high quanitity so the grind isn't that long and dreadful. 


Overall, the game in it's current state, besides very little good things, is HORRIBLE. It's miserable, unfun, and not worth buying in it's current state. Do I have hope for it in the future? Yes and no. I do believe that they could improve it but... yeah, that's not happening anytime soon with how things are going. So it's best to hold off on buying it, or buy it when it's on sale.",False,3,91285

- This is on top of the fact the game looks old and desperately needs to just be in a modern engine as nearly 10 years on it STILL runs like shit. They should have started DBD 2 in 2020 with a focus on both modern fidelity and implementing some sort of new gameplay loop.

Dead by Daylight,381210,206631228,"I honestly can’t believe how bad the monetization is for a paid game. You spend around $20 but half the content, especially the killers, is locked behind DLCs and paywalls. This would already be annoying in a free-to-play title, but in a game you pay for, it’s ridiculous.

Each killer plays differently and has unique perks, many of which are meta. Yes, you can technically unlock things with irridescent shards, but the system is painfully slow. The store only rotates four teachable perks per week, so it can literally take months or even years before the perk you need shows up. And keep in mind that this is a PvP game where most player sweat and tryhard constantly, whether the devs want to acknowledge it or not.

For comparison imagine watching Arcane, getting hyped, and deciding to try League of Legends. You buy it for $20 (because, somehow, it’s not free anymore), only to find out Jinx, your favorite character, is locked behind the “Arcane DLC.” Fine, you open your wallet again and start playing her. Then you look up some builds and discover the best rune for Jinx is Lethal Tempo but you can’t use it, because it’s locked behind another DLC champion. So now you’re stuck running a weak setup as a new player.

It would be acceptable in coop games/gamemodes like in Payday 2 or Starcraft 2, where the infinite amount of DLCs does not harm players who don't own them. But for PvP games, especially competitive ones, it is totally unfair.
