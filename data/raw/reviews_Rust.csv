Rust,252490,210594030,"Rust is the only game where you can log in, admire a beautiful sunrise… and immediately get clubbed to death by a naked guy with a rock. It’s basically National Geographic but everyone is hostile and somehow knows how to craft C4 out of trash.

You start with nothing—literally nothing—except a rock, pure hopes, and maybe a dream of building a tiny wooden shack. Five hours later, that shack is blown up by a clan of 27 teenagers who haven’t touched grass since 2016.

The building system is amazing though. I’ve constructed beautiful bases, perfectly organized storage, and even a cozy bedroom. Too bad they all get raided while I’m eating dinner.

Wildlife is also extremely realistic: the bears hate you, the wolves hate you, even the chickens somehow want you dead. I’m convinced the real final boss is dehydration because I die of thirst more often than to other players.

Rust is the only survival game where the biggest challenge isn’t nature, hunger, or radiation—it’s trust. If someone says “friendly,” assume they’re already aiming at your head.

Rust,252490,210246833,"I’ve played Rust for over a thousand hours, so take this as a warning, not advice:
Rust isn’t a game. It’s a place. And once you land on beach, something in you never leaves.

My first night, I built a small shack—four walls, a door, and a campfire. I thought I was safe.
I wasn’t.
In Rust, “safe” is just the calm before the storm.

The footsteps came first. Soft. Circling. Eerie.
Then a voice in chat whispered:
“Nice base you’ve got.”
I didn’t sleep much after that.

You learn fast that everyone is either hunter or prey—and you don’t get to choose. One morning your base is gone, your loot scattered, and someone’s left a smiley face sign thanking you for the donation.

You respawn naked.
Again.
And again.
Until you start to change.

You hear phantom footsteps when you’re offline. You flinch at helicopters. You see a pile of rocks on the roadside and feel the urge to hit them. You judge buildings by whether they’d survive twelve rockets. Rust rewires you.

And when you log in at 3AM just to “check the base,” you finally understand:
You’re not playing Rust. Rust is playing you.

So if you’re thinking of starting… don’t.
Because once you spawn in, once you swing that first rock, once you hear that distant gunshot echo through the trees...
there’s no coming back.",True,0,69051

Rust,252490,210082506,"The game “Rust” is an absolutely thrilling and addictive survival experience! If you’re looking for a game that will test your instincts, patience and creativity, you’re in the right place.

One of Rust’s biggest strengths is how easy it is to jump into. Even though the world looks harsh and chaotic, you can start playing almost immediately – you spawn with a rock, make a fire and begin building your first base. The basics are simple and easy to understand for any newcomer.

And that’s exactly where the real fun begins.

Rust isn’t just about staying alive – it’s about building, planning and constantly adapting your strategy. Players create their own bases, gather resources and try to protect their loot from others. And trust me, other players are often the biggest challenge you’ll face.

The ability to build, defend and raid creates endless possibilities – from peaceful gathering in the forest to adrenaline-packed raids full of explosions and chaos. Every day is different, every wipe tells a new story, and every encounter can be your last.

If you want a game that feels alive, unpredictable and endlessly replayable, Rust is the perfect choice.",True,0,7942

Rust,252490,210017995,"I absolutely love the concept of this game, but recent updates by the developers don't make sense and are lackluster, I believe this game is being mismanaged.

**jungle update**
  - doesn't make sense gameplay-wise, tier 0 biome right next to spawn beach yet has wildly unfair animal AI compared to other biomes
  - doesn't offer any monuments other than ziggarat, it looks cool, but offers almost nothing for the amount of risk you have to go through.
**meta shift**
  - slows down progression (people complained that it's too fast) by adding blueprint fragments to various puzzles
  - kind of works on low pop, a lot of players from my server complain that it's not fun to obtain
  - you will be prim-locked forever as a solo / small team on high pop.
  - fragments serve no purpose afterwards if you already have the corresponding workbench
  - imo they tackled the wrong thing, they should've done something about unlocks, not workbenches
**pivot or die**
  - made tech tree costs stupidly low (why? didn't you just slow down progression?)
  - removed workbench taxes by default (this is something that i believe should've been experimented with, reward players for finding items in-world with noticeable cost reductions, rather than completely locking them out of workbenches and then suddenly making lucky players with workbenches be able to progress at mach 4)
**naval update**
  - not out, but so far from staging branch seems like it'll have the same issue like the jungle biome where there's not enough value for the amount of effort and risk you have to go through to reach and stay afloat in the deep sea

it just seems like they're changing stuff just for the sake of change and that they've ran out of ideas. although i've never played during this era, i believe that rust's content updates had more vision under Garry's leadership. every update served a purpose whereas a lot of newer updates under Alistair's leadership don't add anything interesting or even actively harm the game. there's also been a lot more focus on monetization to the point where I feel like I'm playing a F2P game, P2W items exist, they allow you to do things normal players can't do, there is literally a hazmat that changes stats for money. servers owners also lose a lot of control over their own servers with new EULA changes, you cannot even the odds between players by giving P2W items in any way (loot tables, ability to craft, etc) as a server owner, you cannot restrict players with P2W items from using them for any reason at all either, it's not a good look and just sucks for people who dislike having to spend money on microtransactions to compete on a game that's they've already paid for.

optimization is also another issue, it uses an absurd amount of VRAM (6GB for eighth resolution, which is the lowest graphics preset) for a game that doesn't look as good as others which consume less memory, this could be a unity limitation for all i know but this is absurd and it was never this bad when i played a year ago. it also uses a ton of memory in general and 16GBs is not something you should be playing with. recent updates have also added a lot of buggy code and constant client errors which aren't seemingly being addressed.

i also want to express my concerns about Linux support, as it would be really nice if you allowed EAC to work under Proton, it's a single checkbox that you can tick in the EOS dashboard and shipping linux EAC binaries. I know it's weaker but would it be that bad considering that most servers already moderate suspicious players? It won't stop me from playing as I've created a non-EAC server alongside a friend that's marginally successful, but it would be a nice gesture from Facepunch.

you've created an awesome game that I personally enjoy, there's nothing like it anywhere else in the entire game's industry but it has so many flaws that I cannot recommend it to new-comers in this state.",False,1,93036

Rust,252490,209989769,"I’ve played Rust for over a thousand hours, but if you’re thinking of joining… don’t. I’m writing this as a warning, not advice. Because Rust isn’t a game. It’s a place. And once you set foot on that island, a part of you stays there forever—usually the part that sleeps peacefully.

My first night in Rust, I built a tiny shack. Four walls, a door, a campfire. I felt safe. I shouldn’t have. Because in Rust, safety is just silence before the storm.

It started with footsteps. Soft, circling. Then a whisper in voice chat:
“Nice base you’ve got.”

I didn’t sleep much after that.

You learn quickly that everyone on the island is either a hunter or prey, and you don’t get to choose which one you are. You’ll wake up to your base gone, your loot scattered, and a sign left behind saying something like “Thanks :)”—because Rust players like to smile while they take everything from you.

You’ll respawn naked. Again. And again. And again.

And then you’ll start to change.

You’ll begin to hear phantom footsteps even when you aren’t playing. You’ll flinch at the sound of a helicopter. You’ll see piles of rocks on the side of the road and feel an urge—an instinct—to hit them with something. Anything. You’ll start checking bushes for movement. You’ll judge every structure you pass in real life by whether it can withstand 12 rockets.

Rust does that to you.

And when you log in at 3AM just to “check on your base,” you’ll realize the truth:
You’re not playing Rust anymore. Rust is playing you.

So if you’re thinking of starting… don’t.
Because once you load in, once you swing that first rock, once you hear the first distant gunshot echo through the trees—

Rust,252490,209876016,"Rust isn’t a game.
Rust is a lifestyle disease you willingly install.

The moment you spawn naked on the beach with nothing but a rock and crippling hope, the game whispers, “Say goodbye to your social life.” And you listen. Because you’re weak.

Rust consumes you slowly.
First, you think, “I’ll just farm a little wood.”
Ten hours later, you’re still hitting trees like a deranged lumberjack, staring at your screen with the same thousand-yard stare as someone who has seen too much.

You build a base. You love your base.
You name it. You tuck it in at night.
Then a group of 15 sweatlords shows up with rockets and deletes not just the base, but your will to live.

You log off to take a break.
You log back in to find your base gone, your loot stolen, and your soul spiritually repossessed by Chad, King of Oil Rig.

To get good at Rust, you must:

Ignore sleep

Forget weekends exist

Sacrifice friends, hobbies, and possibly grades

Train your aim until your wrist cries for mercy

Learn to accept betrayal as a natural weather phenomenon

Rust isn’t hard — it’s emotionally expensive.

Every wipe feels like a fresh start and also a fresh mistake.
Every raid feels like a victory and also a sign that you’ve gone too far to ever be normal again.

Rust doesn’t just suck your soul. It puts it in a small box, labels it “loot,” and lets someone else take it while laughing in global chat.

Rust,252490,209847153,"If you’ve ever woken up and thought, “Wow, my life is going too well, I should ruin my mental health today,” then boy do I have the perfect game for you. Rust: the game that provides permanent brain damage, cancer and high level retardation.

Game is pushing out new phenomenal updates every month. We are finally achieving Facepunch’s lifelong dream: pushing every small group, solo, and casual player directly off a cliff. 
And honestly? Good. If you aren't playing with a 12+man squad of sleep-deprived goblins who log 14 hours per day, what are you even doing here? This game isn't for “fun.” It’s for pain, despair, and listening to a 9-year-old with a voice like a malfunctioning smoke alarm.
Rust's balancing philosophy is beautiful too. Think you’re safe in your base? Wrong. Think you’ll survive a fight because you hit a miracle 200-meter AK spray? Wrong. Think the game won’t crash when you’re finally winning? Wrong again, champion. Rust is basically a slot machine where the jackpot is disappointment.

And how could we forget about “skill-enhanced individuals"". At this point they’re basically developers. They’ve put more effort into this game than half the actual team. I swear Rust is the only game where being legit feels like a disability.

So.. what did we learn? Rust isn’t a game.. it’s a long-term psychological experiment designed to see how fast a human can lose all sanity and hope. It’s the closest thing we have to a digital war crime.

Rust,252490,209667198,"Honestly, it's a good game.  The thing is ; the experience can either be really good or really bad. I've certainly had good fun on this game, and i can see how so many people play this game. I can't see myself really recommending this game to anyone who is not a hardcore gamer. If you truly want to get good at the game, you have to poor hours and hours because other people put in their hours.  It's definitely NOT a beginner friendly game and i do not recommend playing this game blind for the first time with ought having an experienced friend to play with.

I do understand however that it is a fun game. If you are ready to put in the hours, and get better, then i would recommend it. You can have fun interactions with other players and even make some friends. A big portion of Rust's player base is not so friendly, and will get mad at you even if you have done nothing wrong. KOS is also something people do, being kill on sight, so going in be prepared for that.

Other then that, the base game is fun, the graphics are pretty good and the progression feels well balanced especially with new updates that force you to go to monuments, witch in turn forces player fights, and requires a higher level of skill.

All in all, i do think it's a fun game. I've had good experiences with it but i can't find myself recommending it to anyone. If you want to give it a shot, by all means, go for it. Just keep in minds the things I've said - as you might get pretty frustrated at first. Hope this review helped - and have a good day.

Rust,252490,209608677,"I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.

The first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.

Gameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.

Performance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.

What I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.

Overall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.

Would I recommend it?
Yeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",True,0,183804

Had this game since 2017 or 2018 I think but couldn't run this game for absolute ages which had already gave me a bad view on this game but then again my PC was ass.
But when I was able to run this game, yeah it was fun with mates (couldn't imagine playing solo, it's not my type of game tbh it's a lot of external learning) and we played for a few hours, got a base, the whack and then had guns. Went on a few expeditions to gather loot but there was like nobody there which is fine because free loot but I'm pure bravo 6ing the place out because I'm ass at the game. We get the loot, we get the setup, we're chilling for a while then get destroyed on our next expedition from a roof, rinse and repeat. 
Had this loop for around 50 hours tbh my playtime is inaccurate because most of my hours would be from my old PC and loading the game for a solid 30-40 minutes, crashing or getting in then crashing and repeating this cycle LOL.
The only joy I get is setting up base and whatnot but then after that it's when I kill nakeds but that makes me feel evil deep down because they are helpless, yet I am helpless against these roof campers.
Maybe I could recommend trolling for fun or joining a 10x server would be fun because it's chaotic.
But for Vanilla or like modded 2x/3x servers, pretend everyone is the same skill level in the game starting from wipe, it's a game of who has their PC on longer / grinds more in my opinion because I don't see a goal.

Rust,252490,209572693,"Rust (The Game): Brutal, Beautiful, and Unforgettable

Rust isn't just a game; it's a social experiment disguised as a survival simulator. From the moment you wake up naked on the beach, armed with nothing but a rock and a healthy sense of paranoia, the experience is relentlessly intense and deeply rewarding. This is a game built entirely around high-risk, high-reward gameplay, and it delivers adrenaline in spades.

The high tension is constant. Every action carries weight: punching a tree, gathering stone, or even just sprinting across an open field. You are never safe. The distant sound of gunfire or the metallic clank of an enemy base door triggers an immediate, visceral fear. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of watching the clock tick down at 3 AM, waiting for your furnace to finish smelting high-quality metal, knowing that an entire server group might be preparing for a raid.

This leads directly into the late nights. Time management is often tossed out the window in favor of survival. ""I'll just farm for 15 more minutes,"" quickly turns into the sun rising as you frantically repair bullet holes in your outer walls after a four-hour siege. The peak tension comes during base defense or offense—a successful raid or a defended base at 4 AM is an unforgettable rush that leaves your hands shaking and your head buzzing.

The depth of building, crafting, and community interaction (whether friendly or hostile) ensures there’s always a new goal to chase. If you crave a game that is difficult, challenging, and offers some of the most heart-pounding moments in gaming today, Rust is the ultimate experience.",True,0,69447

Having to do an uphill slog with blueprints every month only to be a victim very quickly each wipe isnt fun. ( its also not fun finding that all the BP's you have unlocked on your favorite servers have gone, and if you want to play on various servers you have to multiply the grind). Perhaps the developers are no longer interested in solos or that their goal is that solos are only team fodder, but just be honest.

- High-stakes gameplay — every choice matters
- Constant updates keep the game fresh

Spending 10 hours “warming up” before wipe?
Farming potatoes in the middle of the ocean for no good reason?
Door campers?
Heart attacks?
Hearing the most obnoxious sentences ever conceived? (probably in Russian) 
Getting raided 7 times by the same zerg from across the map who decided it was their life’s mission to make you miserable?
Recreating the twin towers in front of a bunch of Arabic dudes?
Playing the piano?
Forgetting to breathe because you were too focused on the game?
Gambling all your scrap away claiming that its justified because you've mastered the probability of wheel by documenting it on a spreadsheet?
Fighting 7 dudes with AKs while you’re holding a compound bow?
Building 20 2x1s across the map? (every single one gets offline raided)
Logging in to see a clan base right outside your door? (don’t worry, it’s just a raid base)
Sitting in darkness after you finally turn off the game contemplating your life decisions?

9 / 10 Would gamble, *cough* I mean play rust again

Rust,252490,208946496," I wake up on a beach, naked and confused, the sound of waves crashing beside me. I look around  nothing but trees, rocks, and a suspicious seagull staring into my soul. I grab a rock and start hitting a tree like a caveman trying to rediscover fire. Life seems peaceful. Maybe I can build a house, make friends, and live a simple life.

Then I see him another survivor. He waves. I wave back. Friendship? Hope? No. He runs up and hits me in the head with his rock. My screen goes red. I’m bleeding, crawling, trying to say “friendly.” He loots my body and jogs away whistling, probably proud of his new rock collection.

Respawn. Same beach. This time I’m smarter. I sneak inland, gather wood, craft a spear. Things are looking up. I even start building a tiny base just enough to fit my dreams and a sleeping bag. But before I can admire my work, I hear footsteps. A guy with an AK-47 bursts through the door and sprays both me and the guy who hit me earlier. I die again. He loots everything.

Welcome to Rust a survival game that’s less about survival and more about betrayal, paranoia, and the circle of death by rock and rifle. It’s frustrating, chaotic, and absolutely brilliant. Every loss hurts, but every small victory feels earned. You’ll rage, laugh, and maybe cry  but you’ll keep coming back for more.

Rust,252490,208877237,"“What if Minecraft and DayZ had a child that hated you?”
You wake up naked on a beach — cold, confused, and somehow holding a rock and a torch like that’s enough to rebuild civilization. You look around. A beautiful sunrise stretches across the horizon… and then you immediately get headshot by a 12-year-old named “xXx420Sn1p3rGodxXx.”  Screaming 6,7 at the top of his lungs Welcome to Rust, baby.

The Gameplay Experience:

Step 1: Hit tree with rock.
Step 2: Hit rock with rock.
Step 3: Get killed by a man in full metal armor who calls you “trash” before dancing on your corpse.

Building a base feels like assembling IKEA furniture while being hunted by hyenas. You’ll spend two hours collecting wood, crafting walls, and feeling proud of your architectural masterpiece — only to log off, sleep soundly, and wake up to a Discord notification:

“Your base was raided lol.”

And now your hard work is someone else’s loot room.

The Community:

Rust players are a special breed of human. Half are bloodthirsty raiders who whisper “friendly?” before shooting you anyway, and the other half are naked philosophers who try to start rock cults. Somewhere in between, you’ll find a guy blasting Britney Spears through proximity chat while burning down a base.

Voice chat is both the best and worst part of the game. One minute you’re forming alliances, the next you’re being serenaded by someone playing the Titanic theme on a virtual guitar as your home explodes.

The Verdict:

Rust is the most fun you’ll ever have while suffering. It’s a game where trust is a liability, rocks are weapons, and paranoia is a lifestyle. You’ll rage, you’ll laugh, and you’ll swear you’re never playing again — right before logging back in 10 minutes later because someone said “wipe just happened.”

Final Rating:
⭐ 10/10 — Would get betrayed by my teammate for sulfur again.

Rust,252490,208797919,"This is and can be a really fun game, depending on your personal win condition is what defines a fun wipe/play loop. There's many ways to enjoy this game, and even more ways to hate it. 
its got plenty of PvP and PvE, It has base building, manufacturing / logistics.

In my experience it's most enjoyable with 2 to 5 friends willing to play a few hours most days of the week. But it has plenty of solo servers if that's your play style.

If you have limited time to play games this will likely be a difficult one to pick up as it takes ritual logins to keep up with the rest of the community. I would say for me this requires a minimum of 8 hours a day for at-least 3 days in a row to have the kind of fun this game offers, depending on the server of course.

all in all there's been many years i was not a fan of this game but can say with the right people in the right time of my life this is quite a fun game.

To end this review, if you think you will play this game without buying skins / DLC you are wrong, Or more casual then most. 
there's pay to win mechanics in the skins and dlc items that don't matter much in the short term but will become heavily wanted in the long term. Expect item skins or dlc's to change the meta every now and then.

But at this point of playing i have very few to no skins and no dlc's while enjoying hundreds of hours with friends that do. so in a way i can say this game is worth the price for me, more then most.",True,0,34739

Rust,252490,208730678,"Rust — The Game That Forgot What Survival Means

I’ve got a ridiculous number of hours in this god-forsaken game, and honestly, it just keeps getting worse. I’ve seen Rust through every era — from legacy pits to the current “battle royale with extra steps.”

Every wipe is the same: join a server, build a base, run around collecting junk , and sooner or later you run into a giant clan or a cheater who guns you down like a dog. Then you start over, because that’s Rust, right? Grind, raid, rebuild, repeat… until the server dies with 20 people left.

The (recoil rework) killed solo skill. You can’t outplay clans anymore, you just avoid their zones and hope. The blueprint system had potential, but the latest patch ruined it. Big groups hit one cargo run and have AKs, rockets, and launchers within an hour of wipe. Progression’s gone, balance is gone.

My Fixes

* Bring back real blueprints — you should (need a blueprint fragment to craft any gun)
* Fragments come in three tiers (*small, medium, large*) 
* Guns should require fragments:

  * Tier-2 guns → 1 fragment
  * Tier-3 guns → 5 fragments
* Blueprints fragments drop in about 20% of boxes and scientists .
* Move rockets and launchers to Tier-3 bench only.
* Delay cargo ships and locked crate events for the first 24 h after wipe.
* Excavators? Scrap them — they’re just clan property at this point.
* Add drone shops where you can buy items anywhere on the map (but no protection , if you get caught, good luck).
* Give solos a chance — small caves or mini-monuments where they can actually build and survive.

I don’t speak for any community  just a long-time player who’s seen it all. Rust used to be brutal but fair. Now it’s just exhausting.

You wake on a barren island, armed with nothing but a rock and a torch. Everything around you is a threat—wildlife, the environment itself, and other survivors. 
Steam Store
 What starts as a desperate struggle to last a night soon evolves into a complex survival sandbox where your own choices define the story.

Build, Explore, Dominate
Rust offers a multilayered progression: you explore the map (which is procedurally generated, and supports community-map creation). 
Steam Store
+1
 You gather resources, craft tools and weapons, build defensive bases, construct vehicles and automation systems, and even control electrical grids. 
Steam Store
 Base-building and raiding are key mechanics—finding the balance between creating a fortress and venturing out is part of the fun.

Player Interaction = Emergent Stories
What truly sets Rust apart is how players interact. Cooperation leads to alliances, shared bases, and team raids; conflict leads to tense standoffs, betrayals, and high-stakes looting. Your experience is shaped not just by the AI or environment, but by human strategy and behaviour. The world feels dynamic because the other players are part of the ecosystem.

Active Development & Robust Feature Set
The game is far from stagnant. Over a decade in, the developers at Facepunch Studios continue to add major content—new vehicles (horses, cars, boats, hot-air balloons), underwater areas, automation systems, mod-friendly servers. 
Steam Store
+1
 A recent update introduced siege weapons, shields and a new game mode. 
Steam Store
 This means Rust isn’t just a static experience—it keeps evolving.

What to Know Before You Jump In

Expect a steep learning curve: the world is unforgiving, and early mistakes can cost a lot.

The full-loot PvP environment means “survive vs others” is a major element.

Performance and stability have improved over time, but as with many survival sandboxes, large bases and lots of players can create demanding sessions. The developers highlight ongoing work to reduce memory usage and improve base rendering. 
Steam Store

Why It’s Worth It
For players who enjoy open-ended sandbox survival, emergent stories via multiplayer, and the satisfaction of going from absolute vulnerability (rock & torch) to being a dominant presence on the map, Rust delivers in big measure. Its long development life means there’s depth and variety: from base design to raids, to transportation networks, to crafting and automation.

Final Thoughts
Rust isn’t casual; it doesn’t hold your hand. But for those willing to invest time and embrace the world—both flaws and triumphs—it offers some of the most memorable multiplayer survival experiences available. Highly recommended for fans of the genre seeking something that evolves and keeps delivering.",True,2,6225

Rust,252490,208631214,"I was very late to Rust, only getting this game in 2025 because I'd recently been itching for an online survival game with an apocalyptic feel. I have no idea why I avoided it for so long, but here are my thoughts.

Solo: Good luck playing this game solo. You'll need either very good people skills on the right server or you'll have to be incredibly good at staying out of sight. The solo life in Rust is a unique one full of frustration. As it should be!

Team: This is where Rust is at its absolute best, and where I sank over 100 hours into it during my first two weeks this past summer (2025). Battling other groups on the server is so much fun; the game quickly developed a The Walking Dead vibe for me, minus the zombies. The core gameplay is great, base building with a team is rewarding, and even the exploration mixed with encountering other players' bases has been a fantastic experience.

This game is NOT for everybody, which is a main reason my total hours are low (no friends to play with). I don't have many friends who can handle the toxic environment Rust features. You will die, you will lose your loot, and you will be unfairly treated by others. If you're not a fan of that, this is not your game.

Rust provided everything I want in a PVP survival game, and once I have the right team assembled, I will absolutely be back in.",True,0,6524

Rust,252490,208620520,"I’ve played Rust for over a thousand hours, but if you’re thinking of joining… don’t. I’m writing this as a warning, not advice. Because Rust isn’t a game. It’s a place. And once you set foot on that island, a part of you stays there forever—usually the part that sleeps peacefully.

My first night in Rust, I built a tiny shack. Four walls, a door, a campfire. I felt safe. I shouldn’t have. Because in Rust, safety is just silence before the storm.

It started with footsteps. Soft, circling. Then a whisper in voice chat:
“Nice base you’ve got.”

I didn’t sleep much after that.

You learn quickly that everyone on the island is either a hunter or prey, and you don’t get to choose which one you are. You’ll wake up to your base gone, your loot scattered, and a sign left behind saying something like “Thanks :)”—because Rust players like to smile while they take everything from you.

You’ll respawn naked. Again. And again. And again.

And then you’ll start to change.

You’ll begin to hear phantom footsteps even when you aren’t playing. You’ll flinch at the sound of a helicopter. You’ll see piles of rocks on the side of the road and feel an urge—an instinct—to hit them with something. Anything. You’ll start checking bushes for movement. You’ll judge every structure you pass in real life by whether it can withstand 12 rockets.

Rust does that to you.

And when you log in at 3AM just to “check on your base,” you’ll realize the truth:
You’re not playing Rust anymore. Rust is playing you.

So if you’re thinking of starting… don’t.
Because once you load in, once you swing that first rock, once you hear the first distant gunshot echo through the trees—

there’s no coming back.",True,267,80567

You spend 4 hours chopping trees & smashing rocks while convincing yourself this time will be different. You finally build a base, it’s ugly, but it’s yours. You craft your first gun. You feel powerful. For the first time in your life, you believe.

Then, out of nowhere, a clan of 12 year olds named “OfflineOrphans” descends from the sky in a minicopter blasting “Hit Me Baby One More Time” at max volume. They nuke your base with homemade explosives, scream “EZ kid” in voice chat and fly off into the sunrise like war-crime angels. Your friends rage quit, your base is gone and now you’re left in total darkness clutching a rock and questioning your life choices.

I know clans have always been an issue but now they still are but there is no way for solo's to find a corner of the map and grind to get good stuff. Now you are perma stun locked by clans with guns and you can never make it past crossbow. 3/10 would not recommend.,False,1,75526

Rust,252490,208496401,"I've played this game on and off for many years and overall, I love it. I do have some positive and not as positive things to say about the current state of the game though

Positives: I love the game style, offering PvP and PvE content on different servers. This versatility is probably one of my most favorite thing about this game however the graphics have improved greatly over the years. Most holiday events are self explanatory to complete and the rewards are fairly good. The purchasable skins are also something I enjoy adding, and the cost of the items are reasonable, including purchases on the marketplace. Creatures in the game are challenging at the beginning of the wipe but once geared, are quite easy to defeat. Monuments are fun to explore and offer many hiding spots while participating in PvP. Over the years, they have added quite a bit of content and though I took breaks throughout the years, I would give Rust an overall positive rating. The environment is beautiful and the things they've done to improve the look has been phenomenal. On smaller servers, I've had the opportunity to create lifelong friends in other parts of the world, so I'd have to say this is probably my top favorite thing about this game.

Negatives: I believe too much has been added to the game and somewhat takes away from the original vanilla Rust from the mid 2010s. Some items have been nerfed quite a bit so it makes game play quite different while also giving larger groups advantages that smaller groups or solo players may not have. For new players, this makes the game undesirable. Friends I've invited to play Rust with me have stopped playing for this reason. Why play a game that's impossible to learn while getting defeated within minutes at respawn? Playing on a PvE server can be fun, but doesn't quite offer the challenges that a PvP server has. The addition of blueprints has been something that I believe would have been good in theory, but in practice offers larger groups to benefit from right out the gate. I understand the point of teaming up in a PvP environment, but there is no benefit to playing on a large server as a solo or even a small team for the first time. An issue I've experienced is sometimes while dismounting a horse, you'll get stuck or kicked for anticlip if the horse is beside another one at the trough. This is one of a few issues I've seen which I expected would've been fixed by now, but it still seems to be an issue. 

If you can ignore the negatives I've stated above, I still recommend this game. I play as often as possible and I've been playing again now for about a year. I've been officially playing Rust since about 2015 and it is still my favorite game despite the things I've listed as negatives. Happy hunting!",True,6,147635

Rust,252490,208478538,"Unfair False Positive Ban – Completely Frustrating

I’ve been a dedicated Rust player, but my experience has been ruined by a false positive temporary gameban. I have never used cheats, scripts, or any unauthorized software, yet I was banned from all servers. This wasn’t due to anything I did, but apparently due to “abnormal activity” or playing on a server with cheaters — something completely beyond my control.

The support team eventually responded, but these automatic bans are overly aggressive and extremely frustrating for legitimate players. Being locked out of a game I’ve invested in, through no fault of my own, is completely unacceptable.

Facepunch needs to seriously improve their ban detection system and provide faster, more transparent resolution. As it stands, their system punishes innocent players while leaving cheaters often unaffected. This experience has made me reconsider continuing with Rust.",False,2,188791

I wasn’t sure what to expect at first, but the mix of survival, PvP tension, and base building completely hooked me. The game has a harsh learning curve, but that’s exactly what makes every small achievement feel so rewarding.

The world feels alive and unpredictable, and no two sessions are ever the same. Whether you’re gathering resources, defending your base, or forming alliances (or betrayals!), Rust constantly keeps you on edge in the best way possible. It’s a game that punishes carelessness but greatly rewards strategy, patience, and teamwork.

As a solo, every day is a new horror movie. You spend three hours farming wood, stone, and scrap, finally craft a gun, and then—boom—three guys in matching hoodies and AKs roll up in a minicopter, vaporize you in 0.2 seconds, and then type “ez” in chat.

You finally build a tiny 2x2 base you’re proud of? Congrats! It’ll be offline raided by a 6-man clan before you even wake up. You log back in to a pile of ash and regret.

Rust isn’t a survival game. It’s a suffering simulator disguised as one. The building, the looting, the gunplay—they’re all great. But the balance? Nonexistent. Unless you have a full squad, a sleep schedule that matches the server’s wipe cycle, and nerves of steel, you’re just free loot for bigger groups.

There’s nothing quite like hearing the whir of a minicopter above your head, knowing it’s not Santa—it’s a death squad.

As of March 13, 2025 we have enabled Premium versions of Rust servers.  This is an experimental pilot program with efforts to decrease the number of cheaters that are able to ruin gameplay.

Eligibility requirements to connect to these servers are tied to the value of your Rust inventory on Steam being worth at least $15.

Please see our help article for more info and how to check your eligibility:  https://support.facepunchstudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/25840924689693-Premium-Servers

Hope that helps!

After spending $15 on skins I have an inventory value of $0.69 wow! I have no way to return the skins I cant see them in game and my inventory value has not increased!

Rust,252490,208053052,"The ""workbench fragments"" update is I think the single worst idea FP has ever had. As a solo player or even as a ""casual"" player, you are basically condemned to never getting past T1 workbench, every single monument key card puzzle is now ruthlessly camped by all the massive groups 24/7, on the rare occasion you manage to loot the puzzle, you realize you need to do it 3 more times to get enough frags to upgrade. Meanwhile, large groups have already ( because of the reduced scrap) crafted up to T3, now I'm fighting large groups with AK's with my T1 gear and the longer it goes on for, the more I turn into a scav, digging through decaying bases hoping to grab a wb from someone else. Its no longer an even playing field, its very very very high skill solo's competing with massive groups and the other 65% of the player base is left scrounging for scraps. This is the type of mentality that killed games like COD, you can't just cater to the ""best' or ""most vocal"" players. I don't know of anyone I have ever played RUST with that felt progression was ""too fast"" or ""getting stale"" yeah, youtubers who play the game 20 hours a day are going to say that but thats like 20 people total compared to the tens of thousands of players that RUST has total.

Rust,252490,208024514,"Rust has for many years been my favourite game and over those many years the reason why has changed.

Initially I was curious because I saw a Youtuber named Vertiigo playing the game and thought the game looked nice, the mechanics were well thought out and the player interactions were quality.

The game is constantly being updated, changed, added to and re-balanced. 

There is a wide variety to the styles of servers available to play on. 
The PVP servers have no shortage of players willing to go to any lengths to make a play. The combat is intense and exciting. The rewards are satisfying. 
The PVE server user community have a depth of creativity and game knowledge that I have rarely seen on other games. From people constructing amazing bases to using the full scope of the inter-connectivity between the items you can deploy, You will see it all on PVE.

The game is mature in dev cycle and content. 
This is not a game for kids or people who are emotionally fragile, naive or easily triggered.
You are likely to witness the full spectrum of gamer words.

There are numerous skins, DLC packs and plugins that enhance and extend game play in ways you would not expect to work so well. 
If you have ever wanted to stream MIDI to the in game piano you are playing then Rust has you covered. 

I hope you enjoy the game as much as I have.

Rust,252490,207749730,"Rust — 10/10

Rust isn't just a game—it's a lifestyle, an obsession, and honestly? Pure digital crack. You'll spawn naked on a beach, get murdered by a guy with a rock, and somehow still come back for more. The learning curve is brutal, but once you get your first base up and survive your first raid defense? You're hooked for life.

The adrenaline rush is unmatched. Nothing beats that heart-pounding moment when you hear C4 going off near your base at 3 AM, or when you pull off a perfect counter-raid and walk away with someone's entire sulfur stash. Every gunfight, every trade, every alliance could make or break your wipe.

Base building is an art form, PvP is ruthless perfection, and the community? Absolutely unhinged in the best way. You'll make enemies, forge alliances, get betrayed, and somehow laugh about it all. The monument runs, the roofcamp battles, the social dynamics—it's all chef's kiss.

Rust rewards patience, punishes mistakes, and creates stories you'll tell for years. Fair warning: this game will consume your soul.

Score: 10/10. Rust isn't for everyone, but for those who get it—there's nothing else like it.

Rust,252490,207736917,"Rust is a game that stands out not simply as a survival adventure, but as a living, breathing social ecosystem that shapes itself around those who step inside it. Developed by Facepunch Studios, Rust places players in a harsh, unpredictable world where the only goal is to survive. However, the beauty of the game lies far beyond gathering materials or crafting better tools. Rust explores the complexity of human behavior, trust, betrayal, power, and community, creating an experience that is both thrilling and deeply meaningful.

The game begins in one of the most humble ways imaginable. You spawn on a shore or in a field with nothing but a rock and a torch. You have no armor, no shelter, and no direction. The world is vast and indifferent to your presence. The forests whisper with danger, the landscapes stretch endlessly, and every resource must be earned. This starting point is essential to Rust’s identity. When you eventually build a working base, gather advanced tools, or craft powerful weapons, you feel a sense of pride because you remember when you had nothing. Every step forward is something you fought for.

Crafting and progression in Rust unfold naturally and reward persistence. You gather wood, stone, and metal, progressing from simple tools to firearms and fortified bases. The systems are balanced in a way that makes even the smallest accomplishment feel valuable. But while the environment shapes your journey, it is other players who define your story. Rust is famous—some would say infamous—for its player-driven interaction. There are no NPCs to rely on, no safe zones guaranteed, and no rules forced upon the world. The true danger and excitement come from those sharing the server with you.

Every encounter with another player comes with weight. Will they greet you with friendliness or hostility? Will you trade supplies, share a campfire, or end up fighting to the death? Because Rust does not predetermine behavior, the community creates its own moral code. Alliances form, tribes expand, betrayals unfold, wars erupt, and diplomacy is negotiated—all naturally, without scripts or missions. This makes every server feel like an ongoing story written collectively by everyone playing.

One of the most captivating aspects of Rust is the emotional investment it inspires. Because you spend hours gathering resources, designing your base, and protecting your gear, the risk of loss creates true tension. Venturing outside your walls means accepting the possibility that everything could be taken from you. This tension makes moments of success exhilarating. Winning a raid after a carefully planned attack, or defending your base from enemies while your team coordinates under pressure, are moments of adrenaline that few games can replicate. Losses hurt, but victories feel unforgettable.

Visually, Rust is stunning in its realistic simplicity. The world feels rugged and real, with weather that shifts from peaceful sunsets to harsh storms that hammer the land. The sound design deepens the immersion—chains clanking, footsteps crunching on snow, or distant gunfire echoing through the hills all enhance the intensity and atmosphere. The environment is not just something you look at—it is something you feel.

As Rust has evolved, updates have introduced new monuments, vehicles, building tools, and quality-of-life improvements. Yet the heart of the game remains the same: it is a world where you shape your fate. Every player creates their own narrative. Some become architects of towering fortresses, some become merchants trading goods, some become nomads moving place to place, and some become warlords ruling the server with force and fear. Rust gives you the freedom to be whoever you choose to be.

In the end, Rust is not just a survival game—it is a psychological sandbox where creativity, intelligence, and emotion all collide. It challenges players not only to build and fight, but to think, adapt, trust, and negotiate. The memories it creates are real because they are formed through genuine effort, struggle, and interaction with others.

For those who seek a game with depth, excitement, unpredictability, and stories that feel truly personal, Rust is nothing less than extraordinary. It is harsh, it is intense, and it is unforgettable—exactly what a survival game should be.",True,0,7485

       Suggestions: 
NO ONE is your friend.... period. lol. friendlys are not friendly and ""nakeds"" aren't actually naked. 

Definitely start with a very low pop server or a pve server instead of spending 65hrs in like myself running around getting torched by the servers community while attempting to learn. Youtube will certainly help with some relief on getting a foothold.

For sure try to have a team or atleast a buddy to play with. Solo newb is a real struggle.

Rust,252490,207637619,"After 3,000 hours in Rust, I’ve learned many valuable life lessons. For example: never trust anyone, walls are a suggestion not a defense, and sleep is for people who don’t have to worry about getting offlined at 3 a.m. by a group of 12-year-olds named “Cl4nW1p3.”

I started as a naked man with a rock.
3,000 hours later, I am… a naked man with a rock — but now I know where to hit trees for maximum efficiency, so that’s something.

Every time I think I’ve built an unraidable base, a group of scientists from NASA logs on and decides to test the limits of C4 and my mental stability. They don’t just raid me — they offlined me. Like, gone. Deleted. Reduced to atoms. My beautiful compound turned into scrap metal and regret.

I tried joining a clan once. They told me to “farm sulfur.” I didn’t see them again for three days. When they came back, they were driving a minicopter and called me “the intern.”

Despite the pain, the betrayal, and the 2,999th time being killed by a kid with a crossbow, I keep coming back. Why? I don’t know. Maybe Stockholm syndrome. Maybe the Rust gods demand my suffering. Or maybe… just maybe… I like the chaos.

Rust,252490,207627700,"Jumping into Rust feels like being dropped into a post-apocalyptic Hunger Games with no rules and no mercy. You wake up naked on a beach, armed with nothing but a rock and a torch. From there, it’s up to you to survive, build, and dominate or get dominated. And trust me, the learning curve is steep, but the payoff is wild.

At its core, Rust is a PvP-heavy survival game where everything is player-driven. You gather resources, craft tools, build bases, and raid others. But what makes it truly special is the social gameplay. Every encounter with another player is a gamble. Will they help you? Rob you? Shoot you on sight? That tension never goes away, and it’s what keeps the game so addictive.

The building system is deep and flexible. You can create anything from a humble shack to a fortress with traps, turrets, and hidden loot rooms. But no base is truly safe, raiding is a core part of the game, and defending your turf becomes a full-time job. The monthly “force wipe” system resets all progress, keeping the meta fresh and giving everyone a chance to start over.

Combat is fast and unforgiving. Guns feel punchy, and there’s a real skill gap when it comes to aiming and movement. Whether you’re sniping from a tower or ambushing someone with a shotgun, fights are intense and often over in seconds. And if you die? You lose everything. That risk makes every decision matter.

Rust’s world is harsh but beautiful. The map is procedurally generated, with monuments like abandoned labs, oil rigs, and military tunnels offering high-tier loot and danger. You’ll need to balance exploration with caution—some areas are crawling with NPCs or rival players.

It’s not all doom and gloom, though. There’s a thriving community of roleplayers, builders, and chill farmers who just want to vibe. Servers range from hardcore PvP to relaxed modded worlds, so you can find your niche. And the modding scene is huge, custom maps, skins, and plugins keep things fresh.

That said, Rust is not for the faint of heart. It’s toxic at times, full of griefers, and can be incredibly frustrating. But if you embrace the chaos, it’s one of the most rewarding and memorable multiplayer experiences out there.

Whether you’re solo sneaking through the woods or rolling deep with a clan, Rust will test your patience, your strategy, and your ability to survive when everything’s stacked against you.",True,0,316328

steam limited 2 hour allowed for gaming or refused a refund is just simply stupid if i start the game walk away from my computer i am punished by defualt wether or not i actually joined a server or not.

i tried finding a spot to contact facepunch about this problem why they dont have items that say hey this counts towards your premium server access amount instead of having to guess is just illegal and preditory  agianst people who want to enjoy the full access of the game.   there should be a clear laid out what counts and what doenst someone like me who never player rust before yesterday havent evn played with other players yet simply becuase i want to avoided modded servers make this game very preditory on new comers who have no knowledge of such things

Rust,252490,207467693,"I've sunk over 150+ hours into Rust, and overall, it's an adrenaline-pumping survival game that keeps me coming back for more. The core gameplay loop—gathering resources, crafting gear, building bases, and raiding others—is incredibly addictive. 

That said, my biggest gripe is with the server wipes. It's frustrating to invest so much time and effort into constructing elaborate buildings, only to have everything reset periodically. I get that wipes keep the servers fresh and prevent dominance by long-time players, but it often feels like a punch in the gut, especially for casual players who can't grind as hard. It discourages long-term creativity and makes progress feel temporary.

On the flip side, I'd love to see the Facepunch team expand the tech tree with more innovative gadgets and features. Things like advanced automated defenses, or new high-tech devices (e.g., drones for scouting or solar-powered traps) could add fresh layers to base-building and strategy. The game already has some cool tech elements, but introducing novel items would keep the meta evolving and give players more ways to experiment without relying solely on guns and explosives.

Despite the wipe frustration, Rust is still a solid 9/10 for me. If you're into intense multiplayer survival with a mix of cooperation and betrayal, it's worth diving in—just be prepared to start over now and then.",True,1,12482

With an addicting gameplay loop, high skill cap, and believe it or not somewhat nice community to help newcomers learn in stuff like aim, build, and heli training servers, it's no wonder people sink so many hours into this game. I wasn't super thrilled about the recent bp frags update as a solo, but it honestly seems like a good change that isn't too hard. And the game seems to only be on the up and up even after being out for over A DECADE.

Rust,252490,207391043," Rust isn’t really a game — it’s a full-time job disguised as one. The moment you join a server, you’re clocking in for hours of gathering, crafting, raiding, and defending. You can’t just “play for a bit” because the second you log off, everything you worked for could be gone. You spend hours chopping trees, mining rocks, and hunting animals just to build a base that might get raided while you sleep. It’s constant stress and strategy, managing resources, watching for enemies, and checking your upkeep like you’re maintaining a real business. Every moment matters — farming sulfur for raids, upgrading walls, or trying to survive another night. There’s no pause button, no break, and no mercy. It teaches you responsibility, teamwork, and time management, but in the most brutal way possible. Rust doesn’t reward casual play; it demands commitment, planning, and sacrifice. At some point, you realize you’re not playing for fun — you’re working to survive in a digital world that never stops.

From the moment you wake up naked on the cold beach, holding nothing but a rock and a torch, you’re pulled into a world without mercy. A world where every breath is a choice, and every footstep could be your last.

But then it happens.
Your heart starts racing. You find metal. You build a door. You survive your first night.
And suddenly — you feel alive.
You tell yourself, “just one more hour.”
But that hour turns into twelve.

Because Rust is dangerously addictive.
It consumes your time, your thoughts, your peace. You wake up thinking about your base, your loot, your enemies. You wonder if someone raided you while you slept.
And then you go back. Again. And again.

Rust isn’t just a survival game — it’s a psychological experiment wrapped in adrenaline, fear, and beauty.
It brings out the beast, the strategist, the traitor, and the survivor in you.

You can't play this game without hackers/griefers/etc. without shelling another $15 for 'skins' to access 'premium' servers. 
Neglect the fact that you can't host any private form of one, for no good reason other than 'we wanna charge you money for them', and you have the reason why GMOD isn't free anymore either. 

edit: attempted to get a refund, unfortunately for whoever, because it takes you about 3 hours to realize the game is shit, you can't get a refund after 60 minutes of playtime... 

Check out the discussions page and you'll see the problem (and it's always russians). 
I'd reccommend this game if you feel like Garry Newman needs more money, for whatever reason... He's literally not doing anything anymore, but he certainly doesn't need it.

ultra-edit: 
FP: 'we won't let you customise your character, that's not the focus of the game.'
also FP: 'please buy skins to customise your experience, and enjoy 'premium' gameplay'

Just don't see an incentive to play the game and enjoy it thoroughly when the cycle of the game has you die repeatedly to understand the concept of how to survive longer especially with Players, (Lack there of) Animals, scientists and soldiers (AI bots). Which isn't all too bad in thought but on paper its repetitive to nail when you spawn and die to player with OP loot right off rip before you even get the chance to play and might even get unlucky enough to spawn then die again not 10 seconds later, which yeah that changes especially what server you play on or who on the server is the hot shot causing the most destruction in the server.

Rust,252490,206914622,"Rust is not for everyone, It’s not a cozy survival game or a chill crafting simulator.
It’s hardcore PvP survival where everyone kills on sight, and trust is a rare luxury. 

You start completely naked with just a rock, and within seconds, you’re probably dead — usually to a guy in full gear laughing at you. The next spawn? Another rock fight with a naked dude over a bush. Only after 3, 4, or sometimes 10 respawns, you finally find a quiet spot to build your first base… and then someone finds it and blows it up, Welcome to Rust.

It’s frustrating, unfair, hilarious, and completely addictive. If you enjoy raiding, killing, trolling, surviving, or just watching the world burn, this game is absolutely for you.

I’ve been playing Rust since the alpha in 2013, with a few breaks here and there, with a bit over 1,300 hours on Steam. In all that time, one thing never changed — Rust is pure, beautiful chaos.

The game has evolved a ton since the old days. The devs at Facepunch never stopped working on it — seriously, they’ve been dropping updates, improvements, and new content for over a decade. Now we’ve got cars, helicopters, electricity, pluming, shops, new weapons, armor, monuments, and procedural maps that make every wipe feel new. The amount of progress is wild, but it still keeps that same brutal core that made it special in the first place.

basically empty map. everything looks the exact same so you're just looking at the map to travel. it's procedurally generated in the only bad way possible. tech tree is poorly thought out. method of unlocking techs is poorly thought out. building and base protection is nonsense. weapon balance is poor. game pacing is poor. resources are nonsensical in every way. way too many resources that are essentially useless. if you're going to add this many resources, they need to be useful. so while there's a bunch of useless trash to pick up, there's actually a lack of resource diversity. in fact, there's a lack of variety in anything. oh, except for the skins! there are countless skins! they look like dogshit too though, wild that any idiot would buy that shit. recipes make no sense logically or balance wise, it's like a retarded rabbit chose the ingredients randomly. 

and most importantly, especially for a game like this, the combat is fucking god awful. every weapon i've used is just simply not fun to shoot (i have used t3 weapons). i can't even think of another combat system bad enough to compare it to, it's in a league of its own. nothing is smooth, transition from walk to run isn't even smooth so you better believe nothing feels good.

Rust,252490,206840994,"Checking my purchase history says I bought this game on April 20th, 2014, only a few months after it first released. I played at least, 20+ hours when it first came out. I remember farming metal fragments back in the day as a kid with my friends, venturing into radtown to find better guns, but mostly we just built and dicked around fighting bears and stuff. Watching this game evolve over time has been an experience for sure, from an EA survival crafting game, to a standalone massive e-sport fps. But in all that time, it has been a game that benefits HEAVILY from playing with others.

As an adult now, with few friends still playing harder games, most of my gaming is a solo experience. With how rust has been designed, and especially recently, the game has come to be a cesspool for groups of people that live in echo chambers bent on the misery of others. Cheaters, toxic clans, hell even roofcampers. There are your occasional pockets of light, your Willjum-esque players, or the man himself. But the game is designed for groups to shit on solos. It is very difficult to progress with the compounding nature of rust's basis for success. Resources, base sizes, and pvp in general make for very difficult progression when you only have so much time, effort, or general manpower. 

With the old system, scrap was the grinding resource for progression. Raiding was something you could do throughout, and you can always progress with your level of destruction with that scrap, making big groups capable of getting large amounts of scrap with general monument runs, excavator, etc and then progressing quickly through the tree by having a single person use the workbench to research the biggest things/everything, designating them the crafting person or the like. 

With the new system, progressing via Blueprint fragments (Gatherable from relatively rare/fought over military crates, dropped (extremely rarely) by scientists, and from 'guaranteed' drop rooms you need keycards from other areas to access. 
The issues that arise from this new system are primarily that they dont fix the issues from the old systems, they are an attempt to fix the symptom of a problem that is basically insolvable. The reason they made this change was because it ""detracted from world PvP especially in and around monuments."" The reason pvp doesn't happen at monuments is because of Gear Fear, and the lack of need to go into the monuments for anyone other than the most savvy of players. This update makes going to monuments 
'basically' mandatory as you need blueprint fragments to upgrade your workbench and progress. The update originally only had the fragments attainable from the keycard rooms, which was such a bad change they had to alter it immediately. I'll get to why I don't think that this is a good move in a second.

The new system provides a requirement for the threat of pvp. The issue with this is, that the ability for a player TO pvp is only so valuable in a game as punishing as rust is. Multiple players, duos, trios, groups of 4 or even more dominate this game a lot, and it makes the lifestyle of a solo player non-optimal if you want any kind of engaging gameplay that doesn't just feel like repeated resource runs for 5+ hours. 

Because that's what the game boils down to if you're solo. Run for sulfur, run road for scientists, check the closest monument for a military crate, recycle your stuff, and craft stuff, and usually die during one of those first 4 things on a higher population server. But of those things, the monuments are the highest possibility of death. You are far less likely to die doing road runs or mining sulfur than you are in a monument or recycling.

On lower pop servers, you're lucky to have people interact with you at all unless you build right next to them. I saw bases be built, get raided, and decay without interacting with their owner or the raiders a single time. I fished for most of my scrap, which I genuinely feel saved me a lot of time, easily getting 500+ per 20-30 minute run. But in that time I only interacted with 1 group of other players, on their way to do a monument run. The players I did end up pvping were mostly passing through, or at a gas station/supermarket recycler I was trying to use, and rarely ended up being anything truly fruitful, never got any fragments or good gear sets from a friggin recycle run.

And the reason this makes for bad design as i mentioned earlier is because of the assumption that players, especially solos, will go for the method that guarantees them a spawn, I.E the keycard rooms or military crates. And in that way what you have to realize is that, gamers will engineer the fun out of a game. They will make it as efficient as possible to get as much gain as possible, and its the job of the developer to prevent that from happening by adding road blocks within the systems. 

They have since added a new road block by making it so you need to get blueprint fragments, but that isn't roadblocking the right things. World pvp doesn't happen because people don't want to lose their gear. Fight the SOURCE of that problem, not the symptom of it. But by making this new roadblock you have forced players to find a solution, and guess what the most efficient way to get other players fragments is?

If you guessed steal them, what i've been alluding to this whole time, you're correct! I got all my fragments from offline raiding. There's no need for pvp, no need to go into a monument, just mine sulfur, build beancans, build satchels, and raid. Super safe!
I'm sure bigger groups will be progressing similarly enough to their old ways, underwater labs or military tunnels or something, but why bother with that when i can molotov through a door and steal the 1 fragment my neighbor got last night while I was asleep? Especially because the 20+ scientists I killed didn't fuckin drop any!

Blueprint fragments are a solution to a problem that this game cannot fundamentally fix without a big alteration to its design, or safe boxes, or some kind of system in place that enables some kind of player safety and are in fact a detriment to the solo player experience. A solo player is basically never going to get 5 advanced blueprint fragments without tons of relatively boring effort. Metal detecting is extremely slow, having done at least 2 hours of metal detecting and finding 0 fragments. And diving sites are extremely dangerous, with sharks taking 4+ or even MORE spears from a speargun to kill, something a solo will inevitably die from said shark before being able to land a shot. That is effort that I don't want to invest into a game where it will ask me to farm for ANOTHER 30-40 hours trying to get a tier 3 workbench so i can even fucking COMPETE in the echelon the game is asking me to participate in after day fucking 2.

Rust,252490,206775677,"Well, this is akward. Feedbacks been pretty bad on the new update so here is my suggestion for new players:
Honestly, try out modded. Not as harsh, alot more PVP focused tbh, less loot stress and gear fear, a funner experience for sure. + It actually allows solos and smaller groups to not get absolutely fucked by the new updated. Grindings a little lighter and make it more focused on the funnest parts of rust, raiding, pvping, running monuments etc.
I would still recommend trying vanilla servers as it's always worth a try, but if you want less of a lets say, ""Survival Game"" And more of a, ""PVP FPS"" Sorta vibe, try out modded. As always, more experienced players would do much better on vanilla due to just generally being better, though i think this advice would help newer players. (And no, i am not suggesting anything above a 10x, anything above this is sorta braindead)
And i know for 100 percent sure, some 17000 hour sweat is gonna think the modded scene is horrible, but you aren't the intended audience of this review.

Overall W game, i love it.

1. Buy Rust because you saw a streamer having the time of their life.
2. Download the update. Think, “This doesn’t look too bad.”
3. Boot it up. Wait for the shaders to load for way too long.
4. Spawn naked on a beach with zero idea where you are.
5. Panic.
6. Hit a tree with a rock. Feel like a real survivor.
7. Hear footsteps behind you.
8. Get hit by another rock.
9. Die instantly.
10. Respawn.
11. Gather wood and stone for an hour, living your caveman dreams.
12. Build your first 1x1 base.
13. Forget to put a lock on the door.
14. Come back to find someone else living in it.
15. They wave at you through the window before shooting you.
16. Vow revenge.
17. Get distracted by a chicken.
18. Die to a boar.
19. Respawn in the snow and immediately freeze to death.
20. Eat raw human meat out of desperation.
21. Die from food poisoning.
22. Respawn. Again.
23. Get chased by a naked guy blasting Darude Sandstorm on voice chat.
24. Make a bow. Miss every arrow.
25. Die to a guy with a rock (again).
26. Spend 30 minutes crafting another bow out of spite.
27. Hit a headshot. Feel unstoppable.
28. Immediately get sniped by someone in full metal.
29. Watch your loot vanish as they tea-bag your body.
30. Stare at the respawn screen in silent rage.
31. Meet someone friendly. Team up.
32. Build together. Laugh together.
33. Get betrayed.
34. Question your entire life.
35. Build a “raid-proof” base with traps, honeycombs, and dreams.
36. Get offline raided while eating dinner IRL.
37. Return to a smoldering crater.
38. Sit silently for a full minute.
39. Tell yourself, “Next wipe, I’ll do it right.”
40. Join a “friendly” server.
41. Get door-camped by a guy named “ToiletKing.”
42. Try to negotiate peace. He throws grenades instead.
43. Rage quit.
44. Reopen the game 15 minutes later.
45. Go fishing to “relax.”
46. Get sniped mid-fish.
47. Die holding 30 fish and a broken soul.
48. Join a clan. Feel powerful.
49. Realize you’re just the clan’s resource mule.
50. Accidentally blow up part of the base with bad satchel timing.
51. Get kicked from the clan.
52. Go solo again. “It’s fine, I like it better this way.”
53. Build a cozy snow base. Name it “Hope.”
54. Get raided within 45 minutes.
55. Respawn naked on the beach. Again.
56. Try a roleplay server. Get mugged by a guy in a banana suit.
57. Try hardcore mode. Die to a bear.
58. Try a modded server. Somehow die faster.
59. Find a horse. Name it “Spirit.”
60. Ride proudly into the sunset.
61. Get headshot mid-gallop.
62. Watch your horse run off with your loot.
63. Spend an hour trying to find it. Never do.
64. Build another base — “This one’s the one.”
65. Forget to place a sleeping bag.
66. Die. Spawn 3 kilometers away.
67. Run home naked, get killed 10 feet from your front door.
68. Laugh through the pain.
69. Take a “short break.”
70. Watch Rust YouTube videos. Think, “I could totally do that.”

72. Play again.
73. Die again.

Rust,252490,206695431,"Rust isn’t a game. It’s a sermon on the death of humanity — delivered by a naked man screaming racial slurs while beating you with a rock.

You spawn, cold and afraid, clutching a pebble like it’s hope itself. You see another player — maybe this one’s different. Maybe he’ll help you. He won’t. He’ll take your rock, your dignity, and probably your base. You’ll laugh, but it’ll sound more like crying.

You build walls to feel safe. You decorate your home. You dare to feel peace. Then at 3 AM, the gods of sulfur descend — rockets, fire, laughter. They take everything, and all that’s left is a note that says “GG EZ.”

Rust is a mirror. It shows you who you are when kindness costs bullets. You’ll learn the real meaning of “trust issues” when your best friend locks you in a cage and calls it “content.”

After 500 hours, I don’t play Rust anymore. I exist in it. My dreams are full of footsteps, and every bird outside sounds like a door opening.

Rust,252490,206673974,"    I loved the game but they just continue to add more and more B.S. systems leaning to pvp and only enticing more and more people to abuse monuments, clans, zergs, etc. If you have a lot of friends willing to become unemployed degens, sure man this game is genuinely realllly great for that niche. Otherwise, just don't even try. Don't give Facepunch (dev studio) your money, you'll only regret it. Don't waste your money, time, or sanity on this shit game until they improve the game for solos/smaller groups, people with a life and families, and just the game itself. This isn't 2015 anymore, my super pc can only run it at max settings on 200 fps MAX. The most FPS I've seen my game get consistently when in range of zerg bases or just large bases in general, is around 100-125. 
    Just please don't get this game until they actually listen to their community. 90% of their recent update channel logs are just bots rage baiting reaction points. (typically given the clown or laughing award) That just shows you how unseriously this community takes this game anymore.
