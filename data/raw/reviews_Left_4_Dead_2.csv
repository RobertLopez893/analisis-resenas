Left 4 Dead 2,550,209616604,"I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.

The first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.

Gameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.

Performance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.

What I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.

Overall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.

Would I recommend it?
Yeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",True,0,476

Left 4 Dead 2,550,209574605,"Left 4 Dead 2 is hands down one of the greatest co-op shooters ever made. Even after all these years, it still feels fresh, chaotic, and ridiculously fun.

The campaigns are unforgettable: running through malls, carnivals, swamps, and even a storm-soaked town. Each one feels unique, and the atmosphere is perfect. The AI Director makes sure no two runs are the same—sometimes you’re swarmed by hordes, other times you’re ambushed by a Tank or Witch at the worst possible moment. It keeps you on edge every single time.

The infected roster is iconic. Hunters leap out of nowhere, Boomers blind you with bile, Chargers slam you into walls, and the Witch… well, you don’t want to mess with her. Add in melee weapons like katanas, axes, and frying pans, and you’ve got pure chaos.

What makes this game legendary is the teamwork. You can’t survive alone. You’ll laugh, scream, and argue with your friends, but that’s what makes it so good. And if you get bored of the official campaigns, the Steam Workshop has thousands of mods and custom maps that keep the game alive forever.

Even in 2025, this game is still thriving. It’s not just nostalgia—it’s genuinely one of the best multiplayer experiences ever created.

Final verdict: If you haven’t played Left 4 Dead 2 yet, you’re missing out. 10/10, still a masterpiece.

Good graphics, and a very nice difficulty. A baby can't do it, but at the same time a guy that doesn't have any experience with the game can do it. They found the perfect balance. Good story, too! I love the story. 

The ""levels"" are a very cool concept in the eyes of a player. A level, let's say ""Dead Center"" is further divided into three, or four. Basing it off of memory, I can't remember most of them so let's just say PT1: ""journey to the metro"" Pt 2: ""journey to the mall"" and then etc, etc. The middle point of the two is the safe rooms which reward you with various ammo and weaponry. The finales are also pretty good. The voice acting and the face movements are very realistic, they have more then 1K+ voice lines per character! (most of them are part of the emote wheel, also moddable)


The only thing that I think is bad is that there's only so many weapon variants, like a handful. The thing about it is that on paper, it's fine but if you want to mod, it gets extremely hard. They're basically just like reskins of the original weapon. If you go to the workshop, you won't see any different weapons aside from the LMG's, PDW'S, etc. No rocket launchers, no chainsaw-shotguns. THAT'S ONLY MY OPINION.

Overall, very good game. The only problem is that there's not that much weapons for modding. 8/10",True,0,1875

Left 4 Dead 2,550,209388915,"how to cook Coach Order
BBQ Bacon Burger
Ingredients:
1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 fat ratio)
4 slices thick-cut bacon
4 brioche or sesame buns
½ cup BBQ sauce (plus extra for drizzling)
1 large onion, thinly sliced
1 tbsp olive oil or butter
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: 4 slices cheddar or American cheese 
Steps:
Cook the bacon:
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Lay bacon on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer.
Bake 15–20 minutes until crispy. Drain on paper towels. 
Caramelize the onions (optional but recommended):
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium-low heat.
Add onions and cook 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. 
Form and cook patties:
Divide beef into 4 equal portions. Gently shape into ¾-inch thick patties, slightly wider than the buns.
Season both sides with salt and pepper.
Heat a skillet or grill over high heat. Sear patties 3–4 minutes per side for medium.
In the last minute, add a slice of cheese (if using) and brush top with BBQ sauce. 
Toast the buns:
Lightly butter the cut sides and toast in the skillet or oven for 1–2 minutes until golden. 
Assemble:
Bottom bun → patty with BBQ sauce → bacon → caramelized onions → top bun.
Press gently to hold together.

Ingredients:
4 large russet potatoes
Vegetable or peanut oil (for frying)
Salt to taste

Ingredients:
Chilled orange soda (e.g., Fanta, Sunkist, or store brand)
Optional: orange slice for garnish 
Steps:
Refrigerate soda for at least 1 hour (do not freeze).

3 lbs apples (mix of Granny Smith and Honey crisp)
¾ cup sugar + 1 tbsp for topping
2 tsp cinnamon, ¼ tsp nutmeg, ¼ tsp cloves

1 tsp lemon juice
1 double pie crust (homemade or store-bought)
1 egg + 1 tbsp milk (for egg wash)
Steps:
Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Place a baking sheet inside to heat up.

In a skillet, melt butter. Add apples and cook 3–5 minutes.
Stir in sugar, spices, flour, and cornstarch. Cook 1–2 minutes until thickened. Cool slightly.
Assemble pie:
Line a 9-inch pie dish with bottom crust. Add filling.
Top with second crust (lattice or solid with slits). Crimp edges and vent.
Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.
Bake:
20 minutes at 425°F, then reduce to 375°F (190°C) and bake 30–40 minutes until golden and bubbling.

Don't waste your time reading shii here, buy it, and, if possible, play with your friends and discover how to play it and how fun it is.

a tiny nick, jerma, neko-arc, and lebron james himself battle on the bridge so their fish vehicle could get through to new orleans. in there they must mow against hordes of pvz zombies that spout brainrot as well as trash-talking special zombies of charging barneys, acidic withered chicas, explosive creepers, pouncing spongebobs, piggyriding mangles, crying saul goodmen, and the scariest of them all, powerful shreks wanting you to leave their swamps. you collect trick-or-treat bags to fill up the generator as dj khaled says some bullshit in the background and your bot teammates shoot them with a portal gun, a fat blunt, and sans bones, while you yourself hold a doom chain gun and an enchanted netherite axe. there is a sunflower on your ammo pile, a few more maxwell cats for healing, and around the area are some teto biles and jalapenos. no eggs to shoot and explode tho. finally, you finish the game by going to your fish vehicle as you lower down the bridge and leave the area, finishing the campaign. tadc music end credits plays.

> Absolute cinema with mods, vocalizer and custom maps.
> Game is super replayable, at least the first few hundred hours of gameplay (thanks to the Director, being both an asshole and the G.O.A.T.) and the thousands upon thousands of voicelines. It's rare to get the same interaction between characters if you replay the map, or even just reset to saferoom. If the base campaign maps aren't interesting enough to replay, then you can play custom maps e.g. Yama, Cold Front, Dark Wood, etc. Realism and Mutations also make new experiences for the game.
> I recommend for everyone to play through L4D1 and L4D2 campaigns on any difficulty for the story.
> If you find a good group of people you can play with according to your needs, it's a really fun game.

Some things to note:
> Expert difficulty is hard and not recommended for new people because there are insanely toxic people there who will kick you the second they sense you're new, which is even worse in Versus.
> There are a lot of griefers and trolls, but if you block them on steam you will never see them again. Griefers/trolls usually reside in Expert Campaigns, but sometimes there are some in Expert Realism (which is extremely rare because realism players actually have some respect and conscience).
> Too many high-poly or sound replacing mods can crash the game. The game is 32-bit i.e. it has a limit on how much memory it can allocate for each resource e.g. sound, models, textures, etc. Surpassing that limit usually causes audio/fps problems or in the worst case scenario, a crash.
> There are a lot of modded servers, but they can be avoided by either playing Easy or Advanced difficulties only (most modded servers exist in Normal (infinite ammo) or Expert (core-ss) difficulties) or by making your own lobby/game.",True,1,63946

Left 4 Dead 2,550,208744536,"Even in 2025, Left 4 Dead 2 remains one of the best co-op shooters ever made. The gameplay loop — four survivors fighting through zombie-filled campaigns — is simple but endlessly replayable. The gunplay feels tight, the pacing between calm exploration and frantic panic is still unmatched, and the AI Director keeps every run feeling fresh.

The community is another reason the game has lasted this long. With endless mods, custom maps, and full community support, it’s practically immortal. You can make the game look modern, add new characters, or even play whole new campaigns thanks to the Workshop. It’s proof that great design outlives its release date.

That said, it does show its age. The graphics and movement feel dated compared to modern shooters, and without mods or friends, public lobbies can sometimes be chaotic or filled with trolls. The bots are serviceable but far from perfect, and newer players may find the difficulty spikes rough.

Still — those are small complaints next to what it offers. Few games create this level of teamwork and adrenaline, and it’s aged gracefully thanks to the modding scene.

Verdict:
A timeless co-op classic. Looks older, plays better than most new games. Best enjoyed with friends or a few good mods installed.",True,0,2671

Left 4 Dead 2,550,208690933,"As a late player to the Left 4 Dead series, I have seen and heard a handful of references to the games; the most notable about Coach and Elis, yet have not had much exposure to either game in the past 15+ years.

From playing the games in short succession, I could see the difference between the two, mostly panic from the new zombie types, bio-bombs, melee weapons and exuberance at what I could do. Rapid-pace action increasing with the addition of new zombies that both impress and infuriate me. Too many times swept off the the edge or out a window on the first level with the Chargers that spawned, but I take that in stride as I had never met such a zombie like before and had to figure out tactics.

The story telling while the general 'get from here to here in order to escape or survive' tale, the journey is humorous and relatively fast-paced. Some of the levels were wonderful to replay through, though personally I hate the swamp level for personal reasons- BUT can appreciate the design, terrain change and adaptability. Speaking of stories, 'My best friend Keith-' I love the silly stories Elis talks about, thought who knows if Keith stories are exaggerated or a mix of stories that happened in his group of friends is great. I wondered if the stories had happened, though purely exaggerated by Elis to take the groups mind off of the zombie apocalypse.

As usual the character AI is frustrating, which can be expected in most co-op games when playing alone. However, I LOVE that the detail of the game AI being called the Director, spawning in enemies at different levels of difficulty based on the players ability. Which is considerably a kind thing to do, yet also quite hard if the player is exceptional at the game as the Director makes it harder.

Previously mentioned in my Left 4 Dead review, as zombie games are not my forte, I can say that both of the Left 4 Dead games are good for someone with the uncomfortable nature I feel towards zombies. Macabre, fast paced and sometimes plagued with jump scare attacks, it is an overall fun game, would love more stories about Keith. Though I really lament that I was not around in the heyday of the games launch, as I can only imagine the activity online. 7.5/10 Burger Tank BBQ burgers.",True,0,800

Left 4 Dead 2,550,208652013,"Story Time, I got this game on Christmas day 2009 for the Xbox 360. My parents had a thing about wrapping trick gifts and hiding things inside of them, so when i unwrapped a huge and long box only to find a set of wooden patio blinds i was very upset only to find that they had tapped the game to the back of the blinds and i was so excited to pop it in and play it instantly. Was my favorite game and what really pushed my love for zombies into the zombie survival genre of games to this day.  I remember this day so clearly because my childhood pet had passed away about an hour after that at the age of 12. RIP baby girl. After that i didn't touch the game through a period of grief, a beautiful and tragic memory tied to this game for me and it did help me get through that tough time as a child. To this day as a 27 year old man with a PC with an insane amount of hours and constantly coming back to this game from console to PC, i can say this has been a solid game for me since then. nothing can match the void this game can fill. I just wish that the Devs would maybe throw some more content into it, just keep updating the game on its current engine, after 16 years it still has that flare and drawback that for me is unmatched, its perfect otherwise and i will always be a diehard LFD fan. Thank you to valve for always being there, in some tough times. But Please can you guys come out of the wood work and maybe recruit a few of the modders from workshop to pump a few more vanilla campaigns out ? there is no need for a third (DOUBTFUL ANYWAYS) if you can push this game even further with content that the community is so set on keeping alive.",True,0,12205

I’ve been playing Left 4 Dead 2 for years, and it still hits every time. Doesn’t matter if you’re solo or with friends this game just never gets old. The chaos, the teamwork, the panic when you hear a Tank or Witch in the distance… it’s all pure gold

Every match feels different, and even after all this time I still find new ways to mess around or get absolutely destroyed. The mod community keeps it alive too custom maps, goofy skins, anime guns, whatever you want, it’s here

Linux

The game is unplayable on Linux. It has a consistent crashing issue due to bullet tracers, especially the incendiary ammo tracers. Whenever the incendiary ammo is used with the tracers on, the in-game common infected and entity models (cars, bushes, trees, barricades, etc.) will disappear and soon enough the game will crash.
Similar problem occurs if you leave subtitles on -- it also will crash your game. 
And this is the main reason I cannot recommend this game. It is absolutely not adequate for a game from a company that seems to be spending so much effort to bring Linux support in gaming, yet their own game is this bad when it comes to Linux native version.

Thus, the game is unplayable unless you use the community patches and fixes, and even then the crashing still may occur A LOT MORE frequently than on Windows version.

Besides these critical issues, the game doesn't have dynamic main menu screens working like in original Windows version, i.e. it always defaults to the Dead Center main menu and never changes to anything else.

The game itself?

It has rather short campaign roster, though it may not look like it. In nearly 8-10 hours you can complete all of them even on highest difficulty, leaving you either to replaying them over and over, playing versus or modding the game. Modding also makes the game a lot less stable.

The game has actually good music, special sound ques for special and common infected used dynamically in different situations, but the other problem with these arise -- the game has awful sound mixing. Only two audio sliders exist -  general game and music. That means you will either listen to incredibly loud game trying to hear a bit of music, or you will not hear anything at all, because even with music slider cranked to the 100, it is still very quiet.

I did not play the game on public servers or in versus mode, so I can't say anything about the community. My only experience is singleplayer and co-op with friends.

One word on ""realism"" game mode, which is just a campaign but with absolutely idiotic balance. Now every enemy receives A LOT less damage just because. Not sure how surviving 4 point blank 7.62 rounds is more realistic than dying to the 1-2 rounds on any other difficulty in standard campaign, but it seems Valve knows better than I do. 

For some reasons while other Source Engine games receive updates and use 64-bit Engine version, this one does not. And you guessed it right, it makes the game a lot less stable too. It has limited RAM allocation.",False,2,6510

Left 4 Dead 2,550,208409851,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter built around fast-paced survival against large groups of infected. The campaign structure moves players through varied environments, from swamp towns to industrial facilities, each culminating in a frantic finale. The tone balances grim atmosphere with dark humor, driven by character banter and environmental storytelling.

Core gameplay emphasizes teamwork. Ammunition scarcity, special infected, and crowd pressure punish lone movement. Enemy pacing is managed by the AI “Director,” which adjusts horde frequency, item placement, and difficulty based on player performance. This dynamic system keeps runs unpredictable and replayable.

Weapon variety is broad, with firearms supported by melee options like axes and bats. Each weapon tier offers clear trade-offs in accuracy, spread, and reload times. Special infected apply pressure with unique abilities such as pinning, dragging, or area denial. Coordinated defense and quick reactions are essential.

The campaign maps contain multiple routes, temporary holds, and event triggers that encourage positioning strategy. Finale segments require sustained defense under resource limits, often pushing players to improvisation. Environmental hazards like alarms and car alarms can escalate threats if mishandled.

Multiplayer modes extend longevity. Versus mode lets one team control special infected, adding tactical depth and psychological pressure. Scavenge and Survival variants condense objectives into shorter, high-intensity sessions. Competitive play rewards map knowledge and coordinated ambush timing.

Presentation is functional and deliberate. Visual clarity supports threat recognition, even in chaotic scenes. Sound design is critical: audio cues telegraph approaching specials and horde spawns. The soundtrack rises dynamically during holds, reinforcing pacing. Character voices help coordinate without formal speech.

Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 remains a benchmark for cooperative shooters. Its dynamic pacing, complementary infected roles, and strong map design support high replay value. Mechanical depth emerges through teamwork rather than complex systems, making it accessible but demanding at higher difficulties.",True,5,200

Every time I try to put my thoughts into words, my mind floods with such an overwhelming wave of warm memories and emotions that I don’t even know where to begin — or how to end.

This game is crafted with such incredible care and depth that if I were to simply list every good thing about it, this review would stretch for thousands of lines.
So instead, I’ll try to keep it short and highlight what I personally consider the most important strengths:

Unbelievable replayability!
At first glance, it might seem like the campaigns are “one-and-done,” but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Every item spawn is randomized depending on the “Director’s” mood — same goes for enemies — and even the level geometry subtly changes from run to run!

Excellent single-player experience!
Sure, bots can’t replace real players, but if you’re offline or simply in the mood to play solo, they do their job perfectly — often creating a surprisingly immersive and atmospheric experience.

Huge variety of game modes!
From the classic campaigns and survival to perhaps the most unique “PvP” experience and hundreds of creative mutations — there’s always something new to try.

A timeless community!
Even after more than a decade, the game still maintains a strong and active player base.
It doesn’t receive monthly or even yearly updates like modern titles do — and yet, thousands still play it every day. Finding a match is never a problem.

Honestly, the only “downsides” here are purely subjective — not even worth listing.

In short: this is a game everyone should have in their library. No exceptions.",True,0,15104

Left 4 Dead 2,550,208368485,"I love this game to an absurd degree. I play it nearly everyday with my friends, trying out new mods, and running through campaigns over and over again. As you've possibly heard, this game has a lot, and I mean a LOT, of replay value thanks to the AI Director.

But that's not the only thing. The characters are incredibly charming too, and I think the flow of having the story be told through dialogue rather than cutscenes goes really well for it. And it does it in such a way, that we learn about the world with the characters through their dialogue. Some people I've played with get impatient, and want to go on ahead. Which I don't blame them. The game is fun. But I personally really enjoy the dialogue that leads the story along. So I like sticking around in certain areas to that have banter.

Then the gameplay for me, it feels really natural to play. And it's fairly simple to understand. Just pick up your weapons, and aim pretty much. But you can pull some very cool tricks even by these simple mechanics (I've seen in specific speedrun videos). And the fact they don't really introduce any new gameplay aspects later in the game I think really adds to the experience. Sure, there's not an in-depth tutorial. But, in my opinion, Left 4 Dead, and Left 4 Dead 2 don't really need that. They give you basic instructions, and you go from there, if you know what I mean. It's also a cute detail that, at the end ""credits"" of the campaign, it shows how well you or your team did. I like that.

The special infected also add a lot to the experience that I really think boosts the game in its fun. There's no real one spot special infected spawn, thanks to the director. This goes for items too. That way every run is different, based on what spawn and what doesn't spawn. Not only does the director make the game more interesting, and that your playthrough is different pretty much every time, but it's also fascinating on how it even works.

Absolutely worth 10 bucks. Makes me sad we're likely not getting a third installment. But either way, this is a fantastic game... so I'm not entirely sure if we need a third one.",True,0,9643

There are also a wide variety of silly and creative mods out there to make the graphics and overall experience better, which pays up for it. Even then, it's still a pleasurable experience without the mods.

Teamwork plays a huge role in surviving, especially on higher difficulties. Learning and applying utility usage and map knowledge are just as fun as how important it is to take minimal damage.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,207718987,"Left 4 Dead 2 is a standalone sequel to the first game in the series.

The plot is straightforward: You miss the escape chopper, alongside with 3 random people around you. Your goal is to cooperate and survive in this post-apocalyptic, disease-ridden world.

The game offers co-op and versus modes. I only play co-op so this review focuses on the cooperative part of the game.

Gameplay-wise, it's as simple as the plot: walk, grab any guns you see, and shoot. Pick up ammo and health kits, and try to survive in the open, unknown locations.

There are little mechanics - the game is kept simple to a maximum, and it works out - anyone can pick up on this game like any other shooter game. There are no secrets / unknown, complex tricks. You can invite your friend who's had little experience with FPS titles, and they'll know what they're supposed to do without any handh*lding.

Overall, a great game to boot up and relax in!",True,0,6771

I have played Left 4 Dead 2 for over 100 hours, and even after more than a decade since its release, it continues to be one of the most enjoyable cooperative shooters available. The game’s straightforward design is one of its greatest strengths. There is no grind, no complex progression system, and no steep learning curve. Everyone begins on equal footing, making it one of the easiest games to pick up and enjoy. The controls are simple, the pacing is fast, and the gameplay loop is immediately satisfying.

Playing solo is functional but loses much of the excitement that defines the experience. The AI teammates perform adequately but lack the spontaneity and coordination of real players. Left 4 Dead 2 is at its best when played with two to four friends, where every campaign becomes a blend of chaos, teamwork, and laughter. The unpredictability of each encounter keeps the experience engaging and memorable, even after countless runs.

From a technical standpoint, the game runs perfectly on modern hardware. It is lightweight, stable, and easily accessible to almost any system today. The graphics are undeniably dated, but the game compensates with strong atmosphere, excellent sound design, and fluid gameplay. Its charm lies in how well everything works together despite its age.

The multiplayer servers remain very active, with thriving communities and frequent matches available at all hours. Valve shows no indication of shutting down support, and the game’s dedicated player base ensures that it will remain alive for years to come. Given how often Left 4 Dead 2 goes on sale, it is absolutely worth purchasing at a discount. The value you get from even a few sessions with friends far exceeds the price.

That said, there are some drawbacks. The gameplay can become repetitive over time, and the lack of meaningful single-player content limits long-term engagement for solo players. Certain mechanics can feel dated, and the visuals, while charming, are clearly from a different era. However, none of these issues detract significantly from the overall experience.

For its price, accessibility, and timeless cooperative gameplay, Left 4 Dead 2 remains one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made. It is easy to learn, endlessly replayable with friends, and continues to deliver genuine fun well over a decade later.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,207684948,"I can't stress enough how much of a timeless piece Left 4 Dead 2 is to me. I've played over hundreds of hours with friends and random people on the same fourteen campaigns time and again — it never gets old. The sheer, immense drive of completing through each chapters and safe house(s) with the goal of finishing a campaign in mind can be so exhilarating. 

Particularly, the environments in each campaigns and their respective chapters can feel so tense and wack (most notably the Left 4 Dead 1 campaigns) at times. What's so engaging about it to me are how the characters of both games react to their current state of environment that they have to go through one at a time.

You could also spice up the game with various game modes, mods, and custom campaigns in the Steam Workshop, each cater to their own. Definitely recommend doing it if you view this as your sort of 'ideal' game — or if you crave for a sense of challenge and think you have a knack for it; I recommend picking from the 'Mutations' game mode if you want to start off with what the base game has to offer in that category if you have don't know where to start off with.

I personally enjoy playing this game every now and then to either try out or learn some new tricks, or to just casually play online. Overall, very fun and worthwhile game to get.",True,0,35238

My son got this game for Christmas in 2023 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,207531108,"In this thrilling sequel to the greatest horde shooter game of the early 2000's, four survivors of the zombie apocalypse attempt to push through the southern states of America without any of them being - you guessed it - Left 4 Dead.

With a hefty arsenal of firearms, a variety of close quarters weaponry and numerous life saving items, you  trudge through 3 - 5 winding maps per campaign with thousands of zombies, and more than a few mutated threats in your way. Said mutants are Special Infected, which have their own strategies for separating survivors from the group, pinning them to prevent them from acting, or sending them running away from safety.

You can play alone, or with friends as you push through the hordes and horrors as any of 4 quirky and comical characters. You can even play as some of the special infected in Versus mode, pitting players in 4v4 matches where you race to see who can make it further on each map, while your opponents do their best to end your run.

Left 4 Dead 2 expands on its progenitor with a variety of features. As well as the inclusion of new campaigns, survivors, infected and weapons, there are new game modes. Realism challenges players by enforcing more ""realistic"" rulesets to the game; making items more scarce, accuracy more relevent, and damage more.... immersive. Their is also Scavenge, where the aim is to collect and pour as much gas into a set checkpoint as you can before being overwhelmed.

But the biggest, and most hilarious draw to Left 4 Dead 2 is its easy access for modders. If you look at the Steam Workshop for Left 4 Dead 2, you will find incredible modpacks that alter the appearance, sound, and animation of almost every aspect of the game. Making for some epic imagery such as Master Chief quoting Duke Nukem whilst slicing through Headcrab Zombies with the Crucible from DOOM! Or making something ridiculous like Dr Doofenshmirtz doing a Muscle Man impression while making finger guns that go ""PAP!"" causing Amongus crewmates to fall over dead.

Left 4 Dead is fun, challenging, and comes with vast options both built-in and waiting to be added on. So take that fireaxe, grab a medkit and ready yourself, cause once you open that door, every snarling monster is going to come running for you.",True,0,4804

Both L4D and L4D2 were easily over 100 hours of playtime, which is honestly where my feedback comes in. Keep in mind both games have a backend AI DM (Dungeon Master) that tweaks the difficulty. When I played, multiple factors could cause the game to cheese you or append cheats to some of the AI entities, which stacks poorly with game bugs. After awhile the game became borderline unplayable for me, with my time played effectively making it impossible for me to enjoy it anymore (esp when I came back rusty some months later.).

Left 4 Dead 2,550,207290920,"Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the most enjoyable shooter and zombie games I’ve played  and that’s saying something, even if I haven’t played a ton of them. It’s one of those games you can always come back to, play a few matches, and still have a great time.

Even if you’re blasting through hordes with friends or praying one of them doesn't set off a witch, it never really loses its charm. The chaotic fun, the teamwork, it all just clicks. There’s something special about a game that stays this entertaining, even years after release.

Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a timeless co-op classic that never fails to deliver some good.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,207254524,"[b]This review applies to both games in L4D series[/b]
[h1]Left 4 Dead is the only co-op game that perfectly combines story, gameplay, teamwork, emotional voice acting, the vocalizer, workshop mods, and pure fun — all in one package. I would even dare to call it the ultimate co-op game. [/h1]

[b]Games that come close to L4D’s greatness, in my opinion, are Earth Defense Force 4, SWAT4 and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker.[/b]
But what sets L4D apart from every other game is its ability to make every session feel unique and fresh. Thanks to the AI Director, which constantly adjusts the gameplay as you progress, the game feels dynamic in a way no other co-op title can replicate — not even EDF 4 or Peace Walker.

And with the right custom maps, the fun can become limitless.

L4D features fast, simple gameplay that’s still tactical in many aspects. You can’t just run around carelessly, especially on Advanced difficulty or higher; it’s a team-based game — [b]but the good kind, where one or two skilled players can still carry the team. Unlike most modern team-based games, L4D never feels punishing or artificial.[/b]

Sometimes, the Director might spawn enemies unfairly, but those moments are rare — and because the core gameplay is so solid, you can forgive and forget. Even on Expert, the game feels fair if you understand its rhythm: how enemies behave, how positioning matters, and how to flow with the Director’s pacing.

L4D has impressive depth. You can learn tricks, like how to kill Witches in one shot, or find creative ways to deal with each type of infected. Once you think you’ve mastered everything, you realize there are still hidden layers to uncover.

The story is simple yet elegant — told through environmental storytelling, the classic “show, don’t tell” approach.

But what truly elevates L4D is its [b]voice acting[/b]. The actors bring the characters to life with such energy and emotion that it’s impossible not to get immersed. Their dialogue reminds me of EDF 4’s charm — full of personality and spirit. With the right mods, you can even use hilarious custom voice lines that create spontaneous, funny conversations in-game. No other title offers such an experience, especially with how many unique lines each character has. Francis’s grumpiness and Ellis’s absurd stories never get old — just like the gameplay itself.

I’m amazed not only by how perfect L4D is but also by how no one — and I mean no one — has ever recreated its level of quality. Not necessarily its gameplay or genre, but its essence.

Game quality began to decline after the early 2010s, with only a few exceptions. It’s depressing how co-op games continue to be neglected. Many developers try to capture what made L4D great, but they miss its fundamentals — the deep design philosophy that can’t be easily explained in a review. You have to play many games, good and bad, to understand what makes L4D legendary.

Sadly, mediocrity defines most games, and especially co-op games even today.

If your gaming experience is limited, you might not fully grasp how extraordinary L4D truly is. But this is a game everyone should keep installed — ready to play at any time.

I long for games with dynamic gameplay, alive characters, and soulful design — [h2]but sadly, it feels like we’ll never see something like L4D again[/h2]",True,80,49820

An Undead Masterpiece That Never Gets Old
Left 4 Dead 2 is hands-down one of the most exhilarating co-op experiences ever crafted. Even years after its release, it remains a benchmark for team-based zombie survival. The gameplay is fast-paced, chaotic, and endlessly replayable thanks to the dynamic AI Director that keeps every run fresh and unpredictable.
The variety of campaigns, weapons, and infected types ensures that no two sessions feel the same. Whether you're mowing down hordes with a chainsaw or desperately defending a safe room, the tension and thrill are unmatched. And the modding community? Absolutely legendary—there’s a treasure trove of custom maps, skins, and game modes that breathe new life into the game constantly.
If you love teamwork, adrenaline, and a good dose of zombie-slaying mayhem, Left 4 Dead 2 is a must-have. It’s not just a game—it’s a genre-defining classic that still delivers pure fun.",True,0,1761

But as of writing this, Oct 2025, 
practically all servers have been overrun by spam/scam/bot servers seemingly operated in china.
Any and every ""Quick Match"" in the campaign selection redirects to various overly modded servers whose text is entirely in chinese kanji specifically. 
Even when selecting ""Official Dedicated Only"", as one would expect to find a server without server-side mods, they ALL redirect to these laggy broken and honestly terrible servers.
The only work around I've found so far has been to host a game myself each and every time.
But the ease of use in just jumping into a game and playing with random people already in progress seems to have gone by the wayside.

Unlike L4D1 which feels like horror and is more serious, L4D2 feels more like a comedy. More non serious vibes and very adventurous.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,206752243,"Set in the zombie apocalypse, Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning Left 4 Dead, the #1 co-op game of 2008. This co-operative action horror FPS takes you and your friends through the cities, swamps and cemeteries of the Deep South, from Savannah to New Orleans across five expansive campaigns.

You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, you'll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.

Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather you'll fight through and the pathways you'll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play.

Next generation co-op action gaming from the makers of Half-Life, Portal, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike.
Over 20 new weapons & items headlined by over 10 melee weapons – axe, chainsaw, frying pan, baseball bat – allow you to get up close with the zombies
New survivors. New Story. New dialogue.
Five expansive campaigns for co-operative, Versus and Survival game modes.
An all new multiplayer mode.
Uncommon common infected. Each of the five new campaigns contains at least one new uncommon common zombies which are exclusive to that campaign.
AI Director 2.0: Advanced technology dubbed The AI Director drove L4D's unique gameplay – customizing enemy population, effects, and music, based upon the players’ performance. L4D 2 features The AI Director 2.0 which expands the Director’s ability to customize level layout, world objects, weather, and lighting to reflect different times of day.

When you can play the actual game it's great. Everyone should give this game a try.
Value should find a way to ban the modded Chinese games from showing up in the campaign finder though. it sucks joining a game and finding 20 people all with random colors and unlimited ammo and double hitpoints in a game that's supposed to be a 4-person co-op.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,206259227,"1) No other zombie game comes closer to this valve masterpiece .This Game has everything you need, Survival maps, Badass campaigns, thrilling Characters,a number of Mutation modes, twisted special infecteds and whatnot ! and the fact that this game was made in 2009 and still has 20k to 30k regular players is just insane, and why wouldn't they , no other game has better gameplay in this genre with the fast paced action continuously going around.

2) The developers even took the soundtracks to another level , I was too young to really get a grasp of it but now the soundtracks just add up to the emotions and the atmosphere(the call of help from the survivors with those eerie instruments to Tank theme music and the Horde Tracks) .

3) The people you meet are something else, you'll never find such diversified group of gamers, from helping teammates till the screen turns white to the ones that will reach the safehouse 10 mins before you and call you slurs, just name it. One thing that makes this game stand out is the Verses mode, 4 players playing as infecteds and trying to kill the other 4 survivors really spices things up. Just one issue is that Valve didn't continue this game and we never got further parts , but the workshop is pretty fabulous so you'll get exciting new maps and mods. 

If you have never played this game, trust me its worth the money and if you played it back in the day then you don't need a reason not to do it again :D.",True,0,10782

Left 4 Dead 2 isn’t just a zombie game.
It’s a friendship test disguised as a panic simulator.

You start with four survivors — all cool, all capable — until you realize your teammates are your real worst enemy.
Someone’s always setting off the car alarm, another is meleeing a Witch like it’s a rhythm game,
and there’s me… screaming “Kyaaa~ help me senpai!!” while getting strangled by a Smoker. 😭

Every match is chaos.
Bullets flying, zombies screaming, and your buddy yelling,
“STOP CLOSING THE DOOR I’M STILL OUTSIDE!!”
It’s like a co-op visual novel where all routes end in pain and betrayal.

But that’s the magic.
No matter how many times you wipe, no matter how many Boomers ruin your day,
you keep coming back — because somehow, deep down,
you believe this time your team won’t blow themselves up.
(Spoiler: they will.)

The gunplay? Timeless.
The pacing? Chef’s kiss.
The voice lines? Legendary.
And even after all these years, it’s still one of the most chaotic, lovable multiplayer experiences ever made.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,205980565,"🕹️ Gameplay
The gameplay is solid — nothing too fancy, just a typical shooter, but that’s exactly what makes it fun. You know what to expect, and it works.

🎨 Graphics & Design
The graphics are obviously a bit older, but that hasn’t really bothered me personally. There are some really cool sequences that still look great and add to the action. It would be nice to see some proper splatter when smashing those zombies though.

🔊 Sound & Music
The voices are, thank goodness, not annoying at all. The music isn’t anything special, but since we’re usually chatting while playing, we barely even notice it.

👯 Fun Factor
We definitely had some hilarious moments! It really depends on who you’re playing with — me, my sister, and two friends, and it was strategically a total mess, but a funny one.

Turns out it’s actually about your friends screaming at you because you still shoot them more than the zombies

After 460 hours I’ve learned 10 things:

1. Molotovs solve everything.
2. Nobody heals you until you’re at 1 HP.
3. The true final boss is friendly fire.
4. Friendship ends the moment someone startles the Witch.
5. Chargers are basically unpaid Uber drivers.
6. Smokers are proof that cigarettes kill.
7. Grenades solve 99% of problems.
8. The other 1% is my teammates.
9. Reloading always happens at the worst possible moment.
10. The apocalypse would be fun until the ammo runs out.

This game has ruined my trust in humanity, improved my cardio (screaming IRL),
and convinced me that shotguns are a love language.

10/10 – Adrenaline shots are my spirit animal.

Also, fuck Tank Run. If Tank Run was a person, I’d push them off a rooftop. Sprinting for 30 minutes straight only to die at the finish line, is bad for your mental health.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,205677839,"Left 4 Dead 2 is one of those rare games that never gets old. Even years after its release, the adrenaline-pumping action, smart AI director, and perfect co-op mechanics still hold up better than most modern titles.

Whether you're playing with friends or random players, every match feels different — thanks to the dynamic enemy placement and ever-changing challenges. The tension, the teamwork, the chaotic fights with hordes of zombies... it's pure fun from start to finish.

The characters are memorable, the maps are well-designed, and the modding community keeps the game alive with fresh content. It's more than just a zombie shooter — it's a co-op experience done right.

If you’ve never played it, you’re missing out on a piece of gaming history. And if you have… you probably still go back to it, like I do.

However, the multiplayer Versus experience has one major downside: the overwhelming number of modded servers in public lobbies. It’s frustrating when you try to find a proper game, only to get forced into these nonsense modded servers with no way to filter them out. It kills the joy of normal gameplay.

Most of these servers are filled with players who just mess around aimlessly—ramming bots as Infected or playing without any real teamwork. They get so used to the “kiddish” style of these mods that when they join a normal Versus match, they simply can’t play well.

Valve really needs to address this issue. Third-party modded servers shouldn’t flood the public matchmaking system. Otherwise, the overall experience—especially for those who just want the authentic L4D2 gameplay—suffers badly.",True,1,211362

Left 4 Dead 2,550,205562926,"Kinda surprised I haven't reviewed this game, considering I own it and the original on both platforms it released on and have played it consistently for years between those two.

There's not much I can say that hasn't been said before, it's Left 4 Dead 2. I think it's the best game VALVe ever put out, besides maybe Half-Life: Alyx, and it's without a doubt probably one of the strongest video game sequels out there, and it got me into source modding and making my own mods, even if they're rarely released for others.

It's mechanics are absolutely timeless and never have been replicated to this level of quality again despite some attempts over the years, the survivors are some of the best characters Turtle Rock and VALVe ever came up with, the official campaigns are fun and varied and very competently designed, and the AI director is one of the most unique things to come out of this kind of game and is a huge factor in what makes it so replayable. And, on top of all of this, there's a workshop with thousands upon thousands of community made addons and campaigns that will basically guarantee you always have something new to do with this game, and that you can do nearly whatever you want with it.

It's dirt cheap at this point, currently without a sale it's only $10 USD, and for a game this enjoyable it's absolutely worth it. if you have a friend or two, or even three, it's a fantastic co-op experience as well, I'd argue that's the real, proper experience.

This game is always fun to play no matter what mood I may be in. Easy to get into and to have fun with. Simple and efficient gameplay loop.

The gore in the game is still mega impressive for the time. Also VERY satisfying.

There's just enough story in the character dialogue and interactions to be interesting and hilarious at times.

The gun play is fucking superb, source engine still feels hella good. The characters are all interesting in their own way (Nick is the Goat)

THE SOUND DESIGN IS FUCKING IMPECCABLE, MATE. The zombie sounds, the special infected and the music jingle tied to each of em. The score of the game is masterfully crafted nothing bad to say about it.


What more can I say? The game is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Peak Co-op game.
not for nothing it still averages to 23 000 players fairly regularly. Game companies have tried to recapture the greatness of L4D with countless other sad attempts at a co-op based 4 player horde shooters but have never come close to this gem.

Left 4 Dead 2 is a staple classic of Valve's shooters. Each character is wonderfully charming with their own traits, flaws and strengths, with their dialogue being enthralling no matter the character. 
Bill and Coach will always be my favourites. 

The gameplay and the gunplay are fun and responsive, be it quick paced or slower, with the wonderful environment to stop and peer at if you can find a respite to do so.

Valve's stunning music and sound design shines through with their teeming hordes of the undead and the special infected that stand in the way of the Survivors. No two games are ever the same, and with Workshop support? Gaining access to custom campaigns is just a button click away.

Left 4 Dead 2 isn’t just another zombie game — it’s the benchmark for co-op shooters. With nearly 50 hours of playtime, it’s clear this game has a timeless formula: survive, cooperate, and blast your way through chaos with friends.

⚡ Fast-Paced, Heart-Pounding Action

Every campaign feels like a desperate escape. Hordes come out of nowhere, Special Infected force you to adapt, and panic sets in when ammo runs low. No two runs feel the same thanks to the game’s “AI Director,” which dynamically changes spawns and pacing.

👥 Teamwork Makes the Difference

L4D2 is a game built on cooperation. Healing allies, covering blind spots, and coordinating attacks make the difference between survival and a team wipe. Play it solo, and you’ll get the tension — play it with friends, and you’ll create unforgettable moments.

🎮 Variety in Chaos

From shotguns and rifles to chainsaws and frying pans, the arsenal is both deadly and hilarious. The campaigns are packed with variety, from swampy marshes to carnivals, each one pushing your teamwork and nerves to the limit.

🧩 Timeless Replayability

Even years later, the game’s replay value is unmatched. Mods, custom campaigns, and community servers keep it alive, proving that simple but polished gameplay will never get old.

⭐ Why It’s a Must-Play

Perfectly balanced co-op gameplay.

Endless replayability thanks to dynamic AI and mods.

Tense, cinematic moments every run.

A classic that defined zombie shooters.

👉 Left 4 Dead 2 is still the king of co-op zombie games. Few titles capture the chaos, teamwork, and thrill of survival quite like this one — and it’s just as fun today as it was at launch.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,205299015,"Please buy this game, it's like only 99 cents on steam sale which is insane. First off lemme start by saying I have played this game before a long long time ago maybe like 2016 with friends on couch play on the Xbox 360 and looking back I really loved this game and had fond memories with it. I used to play in the dark to be extra spooked but it was a lot of fun on controller and now playing it on Steam with keyboard + mouse was really nice. I like doing the campaigns and also the versus game modes but what I really like is the modding. I can play as Jerry from Tom and Jerry while killing Shrek, Lightning Mcqueen, Scooby Doo, and Woody, it's amazing. I highly recommend modding if you wanna have a gag while also playing the story and having fun aboslutely demolishing zombies. But please have fun and enjoy the game with friends, if a game has multiplayer always try to take advantage and have fun with it, if you got no friends hmu maybe I'll play with you maybe (probably not idk). Please for the love of god get this game on sale and not for full price, it's literally 4 quarters when it's on sale and this may be the best steam value game ever for that price, yes more than Pay Day 2 imo. I really love the guns in this game but I wish I could zoom in in guns and get a good scope like other shooters but hey it works still. Also my only other complaint is the bots are mid, they kind of suck and are dumb so if they have a medkit and are low the game tries to force you to give your medkit to them even though they have one which pisses me off. I love the environments in this game they are absolutely beautiful and in Dark Carnival at the end there's a cool concert scene and I got to see The Beatles through modding gotta love that. The game has stunning visuals and cut scenes which is really awesome especially for an older game it sort of reminds me of like Half-Life or Fallout in that regard, of course Valve is awesome for there big title games back then.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,204978203,"I have been playing Left 4 Dead for about 16 years of my life.

I went from gaming in 2009 on the Xbox 360 playing the original Left 4 Dead
to eventually growing up and actually leaving my mom's house
getting my own stuff, my own computer
and downloading Steam one day to play Left 4 Dead.

This community is definitely one of the best
and one of the most interesting I've played with.

I love seeing strangers on at the same time
that I've seen them on every week that I know I can expect

The same shit talkers
or the same people that I know will charge you out of a window
The same family that I have come back to for 16 years

I'm sure for many of us we are all returning to this game for a time

But I need to express that I am truly grateful to this community
for shaping me who I am

I am now an awesome gamer
Who games 7 days a week

I live my dreams
I live in Santa Monica
I have a Beachside apartment
I have a great job
I smoke great weed

And it's full circle because the same games that I play
When I was a literal child
I'm now playing as a grown-ass adult still in my life

Something stuck around
and it was this game

Through all changes good and bad

Left 4 Dead 2,550,204976749,This game literally so epic man! 10/10 would reccomend,True,0,657
Left 4 Dead 2,550,204975605,"Oyun kesinlikle çok güzel. Ancak benim için büyük bir eksi: single player oynamak zorunda kalmam. Arkadaşım yok demek istemiyorum ama, varsa da birlikte oynamak her zaman kolay olmuyor. Üstelik bu tarz oyunlarda en büyük eğlence co-op kısmında saklı. Yine de esas sorunum bu değil.

Oyunda yaşadığım en büyük sıkıntı şu: Nereye gideceğimi gösteren net bir yönlendirme yok.
Evet, oyun senden deneyimli bir oyuncu olmanı bekliyor. Haritayı ezberlemeni, yolları öğrenmeni, 10 kapıdan 100 farklı yol denemeni istiyor. Ama bu, oynanışı akıcı olmaktan çıkarıp bazen yorucu hale getiriyor. Left 4 Dead 2’de de en sevmediğim şey buydu. “Acaba yanlış yerden mi döndüm?” hissi sürekli peşinde.

Bu yüzden oyuna puanım 7/10. Kırdığım 3 puan tamamen bu sebepten.

Ama hakkını yememek lazım.
🎮 Grafikler, dönemine göre hâlâ etkileyici.
👥 Co-op ve mod desteği, oyunun ömrünü ciddi anlamda uzatıyor.
🧟‍♂️ Özellikle zombi modu, gerilimden çok eğlence sunuyor. Herkesin korkması beklenmiyor; ama atmosferin içine girmek için sesleri biraz kısarak oynamak isteyebilirsiniz.

Karakterler ve hikâye belli bir seviyede işlenmiş. Açıkçası bu tür bir oyundan fazlasını beklemek zaten fazla olurdu.

Oyunun çıkış yılına göre değerlendirdiğimizde, özellikle genç oyuncular için 10-20 saatlik keyifli bir deneyim sunuyor.
25 yaş üstü oyuncular içinse tam bir nostalji bombası. İnternet kafelerde arkadaşlarla bağır çağır oynadığımız günleri hatırlatıyor. Zaten çoğumuz geçmişte bu oyunu bir şekilde deneyimlemişizdir.

Sonuç olarak, eğer yön duygunuza güveniyorsanız ve arkadaşlarınızla oynama fırsatınız varsa, oyun çok daha keyifli hale geliyor.
Tek başınıza da oynanabilir ama o zaman biraz sabır, biraz da yol ezberlemeniz gerekiyor. :)
Oynayacak herkese şimdiden iyi oyunlar! :)))",True,0,2585

Boomers exploding in your face,

Friends “accidentally” shooting you,

That one hero who always tries to melee a tank and dies instantly.

Mods make it even better: Shrek replaces the tank, Thomas the Train is a Smoker, and all the zombies scream anime lines. Pure, beautiful chaos.

Solo: 8/10 – fun but kinda lonely

Left 4 Dead 2,550,204727865,"[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Juuzou/recommended/500/]Link to my L4D1 mini review.♥[/url]

The whole reason I made my Steam account was because I got my first laptop and my friend wanted to play L4D with me. I chickened out during our first match cause the zombie sounds terrified me. :)
Around a year later I became utterly obsessed with L4D2 and frequented modding websites wayyyy back before everything was easily added with workshop. Thank goodness it's so much easier to mod nowadays! I still miss those old websites though!! So much nostalgia for directly interacting with the modders through those sites. Not to mention uploading silly videos and watching the classic youtubers play!! It was such a wild time. Seriously one of those games that should just come default when you make a steam account. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383636715

Anyway, frequent sales for less than $5 with or without L4D1. L4D2 combines both sets of maps so really you only need to own L4D2 for the full L4D experience. Play it normally for a bit to get a feel for how it should be, then absolutely play with crazy mods. It's a super fun time and an absolute classic. :)

Left 4 Dead 2 is the only game where your best friend will shove you off a ledge, steal the medkit you needed, and then yell at you for not healing them fast enough,all while a Smoker drags you across the map like you’re in some budget horror movie.
The game teaches important life lessons, like:
-Always close the safe room door BEFORE your teammates get in.
-Never trust anyone holding a chainsaw.
-Boomers aren’t scary until you realize their vomit summons half the population of Florida.
I got charged off a bridge, puked on by a Boomer, set on fire by my own teammate, and then smacked into orbit by a Tank… all in the same level..
Also learned you can’t out–run a jockey. He rides you like you’re an Uber scooter and your friends laugh instead of helping.

Once setup, it is fun for a while, so for cheap and you're a tinkerer, it's well worth it, otherwise I would recommend skipping this.

I've had this for ages in my library and only now delved into it. To be fair, I am late to the party.

Story is great

The game play loops are addictive, with infinite replayability. You can run campaigns on 4 difficulties and when you think Expert Realism is too easy (nobody gets to this point) you can speedrun this game in a bunch of different categories, including TAS, if that's your jam. Or you can grind for higher and higher Survival times. Ooooor you can do all of them against other player. What more do you want out of a game?

Gore is very detailed and creative; with 100s of dismemberment model/animations, or the option for immediate body clean up.

Graphics are still very decent for a 20 year old game. As you rack up hours and add skins and mods, the graphics will be a mute point anyhow.

Modability is very convenient and easy through the SW. You can reskin just about anything. You can get additional maps and other tomfoolery.

This account has 1k hours but I have another steam account with another 2k hours, and even more time combined on Xbox. It's still the first game I open on steam everyday. L4D2 comes on sale every year for like 5 bucks around Christmas, get you and your friends a game you'll all love and play forever.

This game is such a masterpiece. Memorable music that makes the gameplay much more intense and music also is the key to beating this game. Gaming with good music makes the game so good. Even the vocals is so good, the character's voice lines and screams, their unique interactions with each other, and especially everything about this game. Zombies actually makes you terrified of Zombies in this game. The graphics is still good and is still very realistic, when you shoot an object it uniquely interacts whatever object it was. Its been years and the graphics of this game is still so good, why is this so cheap as hell too? I would literally buy this game for 50 dollars and i would be happy knowing that it was at that price, but this price is overkill, too cheap that people might even complain that its too cheap.

This game is such a good game and i highly recommend it to your usual gaming sessions. Fun maps, great animations, intense music, great horror elements and many more. This game has a lot to prove. Online multiplayers make sit fun, singleplayer makes it fun as well with added items in the workshop that makes bots in singleplayer better. This would sound corny but this is the greatest game of all time. This is even mentionmed in the greatest TV series of all time; Breaking Bad. This game is influential and it made my childhood a better place for my gaming life. I would love to play thios game even when i'm dead, or even infected; who knows, 'cuz this game scared the hell out of me when i was a kid and now, i'm having fun and still getting scared.

Highly Recommended, Everyone should play this game, Everyone would love this game, and now it's too underplayed. More people shall play this.

And yet.. I understand. [i]Comradery[/i] is the real engine here. Four survivors standing shoulder-to-shoulder against the horde, yelling, saving, reviving, betraying, fine, mostly saving. Every victory feels earned, every loss is someone else’s fault (never mine).

Left 4 Dead 2,550,203966344,"[b]This negative review is mainly for the poor Linux version of the game.[/b]
Relevant for those running this game under Linux or on a SteamOS device.

The Linux port just...sucks. It has so many technical issues that make for a very poor out-of-the-box experience. You need to apply a lot of elbow grease just to make it functional and not frustrating to play. I really wish someone at Valve sat down and ironed out the issues with the Linux port of this game, and considering it still receives maintenance-type updates from time to time, I hope to see it happen at some point. But as of right now, [b]the Linux experience is very subpar.[/b] No, I wouldn't call it playable and requires a lot of screwing around just to get the game running properly in its base form.

[b][u]If you're experiencing crashes upon joining a game, here's what you need to do:[/u][/b]
1. Set Shaders in-game from ""Very High"" to ""Medium"" or lower
2. [url=https://www.gamemaps.com/details/30880]Download the following mod[/url] [i](what to do is in the instructions)[/i]
3. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3549465848]Subscribe to the following Workshop mod[/url]
4. Add ""-vulkan"" to the game's launch options

Additionally, if your game doesn't play any music at all, in-game or in the menus, you need to copy over the ""libMiles.so"" file from [b]Portal 2[/b] into the game's ""bin"" folder, replacing the regular one that ships with the game, because the library file that ships by default on Linux for Left 4 Dead 2 has been broken for many years now. For more information and other useful bits, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3269932221]read the following guide.[/url]

The baffling thing is that if you run the game under Proton, the Windows Compatibility layer that ships with Steam for Linux, [b]the game runs so much better[/b] with a lot fewer issues. The catch is that you [b]cannot play multiplayer[/b] if you use Proton. Local online or VAC insecure servers work though.

For the company that is supposedly leading the Linux gaming scene into the future and pushing it forward, it's genuinely surprising how bad Valve's Linux ports are for their GoldSrc and Source 1 games.",False,12,328

You can play this game as a horror game that tank is overpowered and hunt you down. By the way, the teleport spots, edge bug trick, panic event skip and idle spots make this game much easier to wrap teammates and skip maps. There are a lot of useful glitch spots for you to explore and exploit. It is amazing to see developers take those considerations in. Take a break feature is very unique comparing to other games so you will not hold teammates back. Lastly, I love those Voice actors and those voice lines are very memorable to me.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,203544195,"Kinda surprised I haven't reviewed this game, considering I own it and the original on both platforms it released on and have played it consistently for years between those two.

There's not much I can say that hasn't been said before, it's Left 4 Dead 2. I think it's the best game VALVe ever put out, besides maybe Half-Life: Alyx, and it's without a doubt probably one of the strongest video game sequels out there, and it got me into source modding and making my own mods, even if they're rarely released for others.
 
It's mechanics are absolutely timeless and never have been replicated to this level of quality again despite some attempts over the years, the survivors are some of the best characters Turtle Rock and VALVe ever came up with, the official campaigns are fun and varied and very competently designed, and the AI director is one of the most unique things to come out of this kind of game and is a huge factor in what makes it so replayable. And, on top of all of this, there's a workshop with thousands upon thousands of community made addons and campaigns that will basically guarantee you always have something new to do with this game, and that you can do nearly whatever you want with it.

It's dirt cheap at this point, currently without a sale it's only $10 USD, and for a game this enjoyable it's absolutely worth it. if you have a friend or two, or even three, it's a fantastic co-op experience as well, I'd argue that's the real, proper experience.

Left 4 Dead 2,550,203459920,"Better than any zombie game, better than back 4 blood for sure... This game is still very active since 2009 which is impressive as most games don't come this far. Levels are very well made, better than the ones from left 4 dead 1 (not saying the ones from the first game are bad) and there are way more weapons than the previous game, the only problem with this game is that the bots from left 4 dead 2 are slightly worse from the first game. This game includes left 4 dead 1 but i would recommend getting the classic experience from left 4 dead 1 separately from left 4 dead 2 because they include all weapons and mechanics from left 4 dead 2 into left 4 dead 1 which is not a problem for sure, but left 4 dead 1 had somethings that were kind of simpler from left 4 dead 2, like for example, when you push the zombies with your weapon you wouldn't get tired in left 4 dead 1 but in left 4 dead 2 you would have a cool down before you can push the zombies with you weapon again which makes the game harder in left 4 dead 2, but overall this is one of my favorite fps games in my steam library, and the fact that is 8.50 pounds (in the U.K) is not even necessary for a  discount.
