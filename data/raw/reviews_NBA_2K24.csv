I played mostly in career mode, which continues to be engaging and rewarding. While my PC handles most games easily, 2K24 runs poorly on higher settings, so playing on low is necessary — not ideal, but manageable.

Aside from minor HUD changes, NBA 2K24 feels virtually identical to NBA 2K23. It comes across as lazy and uninspired, and longtime fans deserve better.",False,1,5547

NBA 2K24,2338770,195386714,"NBA 2K24 continues the franchise's tradition of being the go-to basketball simulator, offering a slick mix of gameplay improvements, visual fidelity, and game modes that will keep basketball fans coming back for more. While the game makes significant strides in some areas, it’s also clear that there’s still a few areas that could use some refinement.

The core gameplay in NBA 2K24 feels as polished as ever. The ball physics are responsive, the player movements are fluid, and the animations continue to impress. Whether you're sinking a clutch 3-pointer or fighting for a tough rebound in the paint, the on-court action feels realistic, with the new ""Pro Play"" feature pushing the boundaries of player movement and animation.

However, as with many yearly installments, the gameplay feels iterative rather than revolutionary. While there are noticeable improvements, like enhanced shooting mechanics and better off-ball movement, it’s still fundamentally similar to NBA 2K23 and previous titles in the series. For fans of the franchise, this consistency is a plus, but newcomers might feel like there’s not enough of a ""wow"" factor to justify an immediate purchase.

The MyCareer mode continues to be the centerpiece of NBA 2K24, and it’s clear that 2K is putting serious effort into refining this experience. The narrative in MyCareer feels more polished and engaging than ever, with voice acting and storylines that push you deeper into the world of professional basketball. You’ll navigate off-the-court drama, build your brand, and make decisions that affect your path to NBA greatness.

There’s also a more expansive focus on team chemistry and your role within your chosen franchise, adding a bit more realism to how you integrate with other players on the roster. The grind is still present, but now there are a few more rewarding mechanics to make progression feel a bit more natural.

NBA 2K24 brings back the expansive ""City"" mode, where players can freely explore, interact with others, and participate in various side activities and games. While the environment looks great and the social aspect of this mode is fun, it still suffers from some performance issues and occasional lag, especially in crowded areas. Load times are long, and the online connection can be spotty — something that detracts from the overall experience, particularly for those who want a seamless multiplayer experience.

That said, the online play itself is as enjoyable as ever, with modes like Rec and Pro-Am providing intense, competitive action. For those who prefer casual play, the various park and streetball modes still offer fun alternatives.

Graphically, NBA 2K24 continues to impress with next-gen visuals. The player models are incredibly lifelike, the arenas are rich in detail, and the lighting and crowd animations make every game feel alive. The broadcast-style presentation is top-notch, adding to the overall immersion. It’s clear that NBA 2K24 is pushing the limits of current-gen hardware.

While the core gameplay is solid, NBA 2K24 still grapples with its monetization strategies. The game continues to push microtransactions through its in-game currency, VC, and the progression systems tied to it. Unlocking cosmetics, gear, and boosting your MyCareer player’s attributes often feels like a grind unless you’re willing to spend extra money. This continues to be a sore spot for the community, especially considering how many gameplay aspects are tied to VC.

NBA 2K24 is a fantastic basketball experience that’s fun for both hardcore fans and casual players, offering an immersive, visually stunning, and mostly enjoyable package. However, the game still suffers from issues like long load times, inconsistent online play, and a frustrating reliance on microtransactions. The series has certainly evolved, but it’s clear that there’s still room for improvement in delivering a more seamless and balanced experience.

A solid entry that hits the mark in many areas but still leaves room for improvement, especially in online play and monetization.

A Slam Dunk for Fans, but Still Room for Growth

2. Wilt is 99 in all time warriors being the highest rated player, but what did he exactly do for the Warriors??? Steph should be 99 and Wilt should just be like 95...
3. KD only played one good year in Brooklyn and they didnt even get to the conference finals and he is the second best player in all time Nets team???

Please don't spend any money for this dogshit game especially CAREER MODE if you want to maintain your sanity. Those gonna be my review after 100 hours playing this mode: 
- No Story, very confused instructions to start quest if you are new player. 
- You start 60 overall playing against superstar like Steph, Bron, .... Good luck defending those. You can only hope to contribute by pass to your AI or try to get open layup. 
- Even after getting my player to 99 overall, I don't see my player as 99 more like 75-80 ish. 90+ speed can't even outrun a godamn big lmao. 90+ layup you literally can't really made contact layup most of the time or even miss an open layup with somehow AI contest from behind your back. An overall 70 npc can somehow strip you easily. 
- If you try to dribble into paint or use screen to get into paint, they gonna stick like glue or send the whole army to you to even get near the rim.  
- Upgrade is expensive AF, you can barely buy any after 1,2 games 
- 95% of time Al gonna pass late forcing you to take bad shots or when you try to go for layup, it made you layup on the side that the big is guarding, not the opposite open side. 
- AI superstar is cheat code especially fking OKC squad with Chet Homlgren, mf can litearlly do anything: post up, block, steal, hit 3, contested your azz even if you have high speed. AI offense is excellent, especially against you and your team, 2 or 3 people in front, they will make ridiculous shots that make you rage quit (no matter % contest, even 100). 
- Your team defence ? Somehow it will always make random switch or make your teammate run to guard whoever you are guarding leaving your opponent shooter 3 open.

For people who play with a keyboard, it's not possible to enter the MyGM, MyLeague, Season, Playoffs etc. due to key binding issue...so basically half of the game modes are not available to you if you don't have a joystick / controller.

The 2K support is some of the worst you'll see, and don't bother reaching out asking for help, as they'll just copy-paste the same answers they do for over a year.

Sure, you can buy a controller and possibly make it work, but that's not the point. If you buy the game you expect it to have basic functionality.

This NBA 2k24 hits different specialy while I'm playing the game mode Mamba Moments to relive Kobe's great career. This game altho it has its flaws, will always be a great NBA 2K installment in my eyes. 

Kobe's spirit lives on throughout any basketball game on and off court, playing this edition reminds us of the relentless drive and passion he brought to the game basketball, the loved, every single day.

NBA 2K24,2338770,178659439,"Below is a subjective review for 2k24 however I can sum it up for steam players in just a few words. Apparently they dont feel like PC is next gen since this game isnt next gen. Meaning its missing a TON of features and is overall buggy as hell. Extremely disappointing, if you want an NBA game just play 23 or 25 which is next gen.

Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Pros:

Next-Gen Graphics: NBA 2K24 takes graphics to a new level, with improved player models, enhanced lighting, and ultra-realistic court details. Everything from player sweat to jersey movement is meticulously rendered, providing a visually stunning experience. The arena atmosphere has been improved as well, making games feel more authentic and intense.

ProPLAY Animation System: One of the headline features, ProPLAY captures real NBA footage and translates it directly into the game, making player movements more lifelike than ever. Dribbling, shooting, and defensive mechanics feel noticeably smoother and more realistic, adding depth to gameplay for both veterans and newcomers.

Mamba Moments: This new mode is a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, letting players re-live iconic moments from his legendary career. It’s an exciting addition that pays respect to one of the game’s greats, complete with challenges that capture Kobe’s unique playstyle and legacy.

MyTeam with Crossplay: NBA 2K24 now offers crossplay for MyTeam, allowing PlayStation and Xbox players to compete with each other. The card-collecting mode has also been simplified, and several fan-favorite features, like the return of MT, make MyTeam more accessible for players who don’t want to spend on microtransactions.

MyCareer with Expanded City & New Storyline: The City has been expanded with more interactive elements, and the MyCareer storyline offers a fresh, cinematic journey that dives into the challenges of being a rising NBA star. The new RPG-like decision-making elements let players shape their journey more meaningfully.

Cons:

Heavily Monetized Microtransactions: Unfortunately, NBA 2K24’s reliance on microtransactions is as strong as ever. VC is still required for nearly every aspect of progression in MyCareer and MyTeam. Grinding VC without spending real money remains extremely slow, and it can feel pay-to-win, especially in online modes.

Limited Innovation Beyond Visuals: While the game shines in presentation, the core gameplay feels only slightly refined from NBA 2K23. Some long-standing issues with defense and shot timing remain, and veterans might find the gameplay too similar, with few substantial changes in mechanics.

MyCareer’s Grind Remains: Although the storyline is fresh, the grind for badges, attributes, and VC continues. Unless you’re willing to put in serious time or invest in VC, character progression can feel frustratingly slow, impacting the enjoyment of MyCareer’s more competitive aspects.

Server Instability and Latency: Even with crossplay, server issues continue to be a drawback. Players report latency and occasional disconnects in online modes, which can be disruptive in competitive play and negatively affect the experience.

AI Inconsistencies: The AI, while improved, still has moments of odd decision-making, especially in team-based modes. Whether it's teammates making strange choices on defense or opponents seeming unusually overpowered, the AI could use some fine-tuning.

Verdict: NBA 2K24 is a visually impressive installment with new features like ProPLAY and Mamba Moments that add depth and excitement. However, its heavy reliance on microtransactions and lack of major gameplay innovations leave it feeling a bit stagnant. Longtime fans of the series might enjoy the nostalgia and Kobe Bryant tributes, but new players or those wary of microtransactions may find the experience frustrating. It’s a solid game, but one that falls short of pushing the series forward.",False,3,1194

NBA 2K24,2338770,178082327,"From the moment the game booted up, NBA 2K24 Kobe Bryant Edition made it clear this wasn't just a tribute but a true homage to Kobe's legacy. As a first-time player diving into this edition, I was immediately struck by the level of realism in both graphics and gameplay mechanics. The opening scenes that highlight Kobe’s legendary career moments set the tone with a mix of nostalgia and awe. Once on the court, the improvements in player movements, dribbling, and shooting mechanics were apparent, especially the attention to Kobe’s signature moves and style. Executing his fadeaway or spin move felt so satisfying; it’s as if the game captured the essence of his playstyle.

The MyCareer mode brings an added layer of depth, particularly for those who idolize Kobe. From designing your own player to choosing a playstyle, each choice echoes Kobe's tenacity and ambition. As I progressed, the new ProPLAY technology shone through, with smoother animations and more lifelike player interactions that brought the entire court to life. The integration of Kobe-themed content, like his jerseys, challenges, and special rewards, added an extra motivation to keep playing and aim higher—mirroring the Mamba Mentality. Even the atmosphere in the arenas felt amplified, with crowd reactions and commentary that paid subtle nods to Kobe’s influence on the game and the league as a whole.

Overall, the NBA 2K24 Kobe Bryant Edition doesn’t just provide a typical sports game experience. It offers a heartfelt tribute to Kobe, reminding fans why he was such an icon. For anyone stepping into his shoes for the first time, the game delivers on every level, bridging past and present in a way only NBA 2K can achieve.",True,0,19682

All my games is about raging and alt+F4-ing, when in the 2k23 was more enjoyment and has more motivation even if you loose. Unfortunately 2k forgot all those who played them game for MyCarrier mode, and they just focused on your money as every single time the game kinda force you to buy more VC's. It's now just a pay to win game with no fun for the ""single players""... They still not fixed the bug where you are on the bench and want to skip the time. The time is just slowly goes slower and slower for almost a minute before you can skip it. Fortunately Alt+Tab can help that. Also still need to wait a lot on timeouts before you can skip.

NBA 2K24,2338770,172957480,"NBA 2K24 for PC plays a pretty good game of basketball if you are playing offline. The game is overall much smoother and more fluid as far as gameplay. Players run the court with a sense of purpose as they will position and reposition themselves to make plays naturally which is a welcome change. With that being said AI seems vastly improved. But overall the game is pretty much very similar to last year's installment.

The stadium atmosphere is electric, and big plays seem to garner a huge reaction from the crowd this year. Close games feel realistic as playoff games sound and look like high intensity playoff games. Crowd noise is robust and gives you a true sense of a real NBA game atmosphere. One thing I feel is off is the booing... especially for road teams. Would like to see crowds more rambunctious especially with rivalry games.

Presentation is top notch per usual. The various broadcast combinations available give the game fresh life as Kevin Harlan's voice has worn on my ears over the years. I would love to have a choice on the team select screen to chose our broadcast style. For example we could choose local or national tv broadcast presentation. Each having their own unique feel, style & mode specific broadcasters.

 
As far as mods for this game... it has been a mixed bag of good and bad, but mostly bad. Mods this year are basically hit or miss. The issues arise whenever I try and mod this game. 2K24 seems to glitch out bad when adding certain mods this year, especially Looyh's Hook which allows for more complex modding, seems to be broken for 2K24. There is a work around to fix this but finding that fix online can be a pain. Mod sites tend to post mods but very few if any clear instructions on how to install these mods. So a lot of people are turned off from even trying to mod 2K. A lot of content creators in the NBA2K PC community are trash and don't do a good job of explaining. Or either they make 20+ minute videos that ultimately just babble and don't help. Seems like support for most mods we have grown to love have disappeared this year as most modders have abandoned 2K on PC for refusing to give us the ""next-gen"" version we desired in previous years. Though we will see ""next-gen"" on PC with 2K25 the jury is still out on how ""mod-friendly"" this game will be. Unfortunately the NBA2K PC community has died off. People like ""The Goods"" and ""Shady Mike"" do their best to keep the community alive but truth is there aren't enough PC gamers interested in 2K anymore to have a strong online presence. Thus why I believed 2K was hesitant to release next-gen on PC. Was just not enough people overall playing NBA2K on PC to be profitable... thus the modding community suffers.

MyCareer is an extremely frustrating experience unless you are willing to pay for your character to be maxed out and that could cost well over $150 in real money to purchase ""Virtual Currency"" to level up your player. Totally not worth the effort and I suggest you bypass this mode at all cost. A fun alternative is Mamba Moments where you play significant historic games of the late, great Kobe Bryant. Free to play and loads of fun.

My verdict... if you can find this game cheap then I guess it's worth a buy, but I would never pay full price for this game in it's current state. If you have 2K23 then I'd say keep it and just mod it up. There seems to be  much more mod choices for 2K23 than 2K24. If you plan to mod this game... do your research to even see if it's worth it.",False,2,7806

NBA 2K24,2338770,172313344,"This game is a complete miserable failure!

Everything about it is wrong. The last NBA 2K game that I've played was 2K14. How on earth did this franchise reach such a low standard? MyCareer is a soulless joke. If 10 years ago you would start in college and play some games in order to be drafted according to your performance and interviews with the scouts from different teams, here you just select the desired NBA team and there you go; you're a starter with a 60 rating.

I wouldn't mind the grinding because in the older titles you would also need one full season to be a decent player and increase the rating. The difference is that this time they push the micro transactions in a crazy way by offering the most artificial grinding that I've ever encountered. In the older titles you would still make some shots, even 3 pointers, while here it's almost impossible. The only way that I've found to make it more effective is to lower the difficulty while only doing pick'n'rolls. The game literally makes your experience in MyCareer unbearable and utterly not enjoyable in order to push you to buy credits and increase your player's rating.

The open world (neighborhood or whatever it's called) is something that I don't enjoy at all. Why can't I use the standard menu to buy shoes instead of having to ride some stupid goofy hoverboard to the store? Also, why do I have to spent credits on shoes? In the older titles you could wear whatever shoe you wanted. What is more, you could even design your own shoe after getting endorsed by some manufacturer. Probably here you can as well, but I couldn't care less as I'm not going to attempt to progress further.

The Reasons:
1. Dozens of cheaters in the online multiplayer mode in MyCareer. I met an 60s OVR player online and always do 3s and always green beans. Glad I wasn't on the opposite team. But you're unfortunate to be their opponent team.

2. You're a F2P = You had to embrace the Imbalance online gameplay experience. Most of the players are cheaters or already 99 OVR (cuz reason number 1 and 4 ) and I don't think 2K want to handle some ""pity"" issues like this right now or in the future.

3. No story (again) in MyCareer mode. No high school and college match. Just straight into your first NBA match and play basketball till you're bored to death. No side activities in your schedule whatsoever. Dull to infinity and beyond.

4. And the final reason, you just need to spend your money for VC, and everything will be easy.

BUT, if you're looking for a basketball simulation game... I still not recommended this, lol.
Cuz the NBA 2K25 already release so, just buy the latest version if you can afford it or never play NBA 2K before. No need to think twice if the price drop on sale (And it definitely will drop). NBA 2K25 is the same port as the next-gen console version.

NBA 2K24,2338770,171967882,"Let me start by saying this: PLEASE DO NOT BUY NBA 2K GAMES! 

The amount of greed and laziness is apparently endless in the world of 2k. Every year they hype up their games: new animations, groundbreaking player movement, never before seen realism. They say their product is the closest thing to real basketball in the virtual space. Technically, they're right: sadly 2k has no competitors making Nba games, and this is the biggest shame in sports games' existence!
I put countless hours into playing 2k21, but you know, they kill online servers, and I craved a bit of mycareer so I bought this game during the 2024 summer sale. It took me just a few hours to realise, this is the SAME GAME as 2k21 but somehow even worse! 
I mean it is just so irritating that people keep buying these games and 2k has no incentive whatsoever to make a remotely enjoyable product because the money is still pouring in even with the tiniest effort. This beautiful game has the same exact animations, same cutscenes, same line by commentators, exact same gamemodes without any improvement, it is a pure copy-paste game and I'm comparing it to 2k21, not even last year's game!! This is a mere skin update: they reworked the menus a little bit, created an awful neighbourhood (which is completely dead by now) and that's it! A mere roster update and the added mambe moments which I don't bother playing with anyway. And I just can't express how painful it was to enjoy the gameplay: how do you make the core of the game, the actual basketball even worse? It is outrageous how little effort they put into developing this crap. The gamemode that everyone waits for, the main attraction, MyCareer, it is simply a cheap, greedy cash grab, nothing more! You are thrown into the Nba as a 60 Overall. 60! You know how low that is? And this 60 overall player is way worse than let's say a MyLeague 60 overall guy! Way off, not exaggereating! Side note: you are supposed to be a first round pick, still, your player completely sucks. So, let's ignore the fact that your player has not been given any background story, no high school or college gameplay, nothing. (By the way, in 2k21 we had a decent story and you could actually enjoy the gameplay at the college level.) Do you know why we have to live with the abscence of any mycareer story? Because if you were to have that time to work through your way into the nba, you could actually upgrade your build, get to know the game a little bit, etc. No, instead you are the most average player ever who can't make a wide open layup on pro difficulty! Why? To make you empty your wallet right away to buy a load of vc and upgrade your build in order to have a somewhat enjoyable experience! You may think I'm using over the top words to describe this, but this attitude is disgusting, and I haven't even talked about how crazy expensive the upgrades have become, compared to recent games! You may have to spend 100-200 euros plus (or even more, especially if you want to max out more than one build) over the original price of the game! This is revolting, nothing less!
Oh and the gameplay? I have never wanted to delete a game more times before! The actual basketball is barely enjoyable sometimes! Ai defenders have a 60-70% contest just by being next to me, while my perfect defense is only enough for, let's say a 20% contest. Ai players' IQ is below comprehension also, both on offense and defense. 9 times out of 10 they don't bother playing help defence and it's sooo annyoing! Also, the schemes I learned in 2k21 are still working, because this is the exact same game!!

All in all, I think players have to stop buying these games, because if not, nothing is going to change and 2k36 will still be the same game that we had 20 years prior. This company has become so money-hunting that no user feedback is being considered! It is also outrageous how console players get preferential treatment over the pc version, bc those next gen 2ks are a different category compared to this mess. 
I am almost glad that the support cycle is ending and shortly they're taking down this game from the store, because I don't wish to my worst enemy to play Nba 2k24!

NBA 2K24,2338770,171848770,"This review aims to MyCareer and MyTeam modes. Terrible pay to win experience. You start off in career mode with a 60 OVR player, no storyline like the previous games, and you're expected to play more than you want to have a decent player, or pay to progress faster and reach max overall if you spend too much money. And for what, for a game that the ""sim to next appearance"" option does not work and you have to wait until you get subbed in again (happens to me). No fair matchmaking of course, since they want you to be stepped upon until you pay for VC and create a playable character. Same thing in MyTeam. No effort from 2K to create a fair matchmaking system (70 vs 90 overall for instance) for the reason stated above. You should gamble on player packs (like EA FC24 UT) if you want to get the best players. Imo virtual basketball is destroyed since NBA 2K17 and won't be revived until some big company creates its own virtual basketball game, which means competition. So if you're after MyCareer or MyTeam don't bother buying any NBA 2K game if you don't want to spend big money.

NBA 2K24,2338770,171837938,"i never played many sports games as a kid nor cared about sports until fairly recently, but after spending a lot of time with mlb the show and gaining newfound appreciation for baseball because of it i decided to try out the games for other sports and i have to say this is not it. first off 150gb... really? fifa is less than 50 and has more teams, stadiums, and players and other games that are 150gb like cod have so much more to do (and look and run significantly better). second this game loves to waste your time. in the 7~ hours i played in my career my guy went from being a 60 overall to a 63 while in fifa i gained 5 overall in half the time. third this game loves to waste your money, if you want to skip the tedious grinding in my career you can just buy points to make your guy better which just feels bad in a full price game, especially if you want to play online with your guy. similarly, if you don't spend money on my team you just cannot compete with those who have. i did not spend a dime on the show besides the entry fee and was able to get a 99 overall diamond dynasty team without too much trouble. the gameplay is fine but nothing to write home about. the only good thing about this game is that i can play it on pc which beats the show and nhl. maybe pick it up if its on sale and you don't already have another 2k but i would not spend more than $10 on this and i have no plans of buying another years one unless significant changes are made",False,0,577

I held it until I couldn't, but there is no other word to describe this game but s**t. I've known 2k since the 2k14 version and have played several of their releases. And I certainly only enjoy playing career mode, but it's impossible here. Your player grows at a snail's pace, and even if you've put in money to increase your skills quickly, it doesn't help at all. I'm not new to playing sports games, I'm not new to 2k either. By the time you want to reach an average of 80, most of the players you know today are already in retirement. Not to mention that your player and not just him, but your whole team sucks. I thought playing at the higher settings I could get my team to do what they are supposed to do, not be so stupid, but it's crazy. It doesn't matter if you go to Dallas, Golden, Lakers, you can play with all the best players on your team, that easily teams from mid-table down can beat you in the game and by a landslide. The rival teams, the machine you're competing with, take the most impossible shots, you'll s**t in your seat. It doesn't matter if they are guarded at 100%. Embid has the speed of a skinny small forward. All the big guys on the teams that the machine controls, make three pointers like they were Curry, and you go and look at their 3s stats and they average 55 or less. All my matches I finish with an A score, but it makes no sense at all when you just watch your team be so stupid. It's super annoying. I understand that they have to add difficulty to the game, but let's see, unless you're a gaming addict, you're not going to stomach this kind of stuff. There are a lot of weird moves too. My last player was a 7'1"" center and even then, he couldn't pass and get out of the way of a 6'1"" player. It's like they tie up your player and he can't get off. Where in the h** does that make sense? Not to mention the rebounding, no.... This game is a 2/5 for me.

NBA 2K24,2338770,171255555,"I generally only get newer sports games in a franchise once every few years, as more often then not, they don't change too much each year. 2K games change even less and I hadn't put much serious time into any of them since NBA 2K16 which I played on both PC and console.

I got NBA 2k24 on sale as I do all NBA 2K games because to be honest, they really aren't worth their AAA pricetage considering the fact you need to pour more money into them to be competitive. NBA2K's online play is not friendly for newcomers and has always been a bit grindy with microtransactions to speed up the process to get anywhere, but it [i]was[/i] doable. 
Not the case with 2K24. Unless you are playing offline alone and don't mind a slow and torturous grind just to get your player up to ""average"", you will need to spend. They have slowed progression down to a crawl sucking all the fun out of the game for those who don't. You will need to spend and spend and spend to do anything and get anywhere.


It has become nothing more than what should be a F2P game with microtransactions, except it comes with a premium AAA pricetag which is sickening when you learn just how much they make on each NBA 2K game. The graphics and gameplay have barely changed in 8 years and will probably be surpassed on PC by the mobile versions soon enough. 
It's yet another outdated lazy stripped down POS cashgrab on PC which is only worth getting at a massive discount if you are playing one on one with your friends. Even then, the servers will be closed soon enough which is what forces people to essentially buy the same game again each year.  

This is the worse 2K game I have played and they will keep doing this as long as Take-Two have a monopoly on the NBA license. We really need another company to come in and give them some competition even if it's EA again, but I doubt EA will spend over a billion dollars for a game license...

NBA 2K24,2338770,171070411,"Worst gameplay in the history or 2k. I am ashamed I even payed $10 for this trash.

I play on all-star, I play my league, nothing crazy. But the variable shot bar is so annoying and bad. I have had countless barely contested shots that have literally 0 green area, so a 0% chance to make the shot. You should never have a 0% to make any shot, players make tough shots in real life all the time. The PC in this game seems to make some shots that if it was me shooting it would not have any green zone and 0% chance. The free throws, god the free throws, I will make it with the bar not even close to the green then I will max the bar to a would be perfect green and it misses. It makes no sense and I’m so over it. These are just small part of the larger story that makes this game the worst in history. 

Along with the usual, no changes in graphics, game modes, features, everything is exactly the same. The poor mechanics and gameplay are a result of years and years of not feeling the pressure to change the product. Leaving a perfect example of why there needs to be competition in the marketplace, there shouldn’t be only one licensed title, it overall becomes bad for the NBA brand.

I understand why people hated the Franchise itself not just the 2k24. 
""It's just a roster update""
""It's the same game just a different year""
""Nothing new at all""
-
While Yes, I do agree with this. However it's a ""simulation"" game for a reason. I'd personally compare it to Stardew Valley and other ""farming simulators games"" as you have one certain goal on this game genre (simulation). Hell, I'd understand if people gave negative reviews with the Nintendo Switch 2k24, its barely unplayable at 30fps.
-
But to play this game in a steam deck and in a PC, In my opinion, is still one of the best experience I had in terms of simulation games. Sure it isn't the best basketball simulator. I actually still think that NBA Live franchise clocks on top, 2k franchise is still a good simulation if you're looking for a  basketball experience. I don't actually think that you have other choices besides this. 
-
Game still gives me the adrenaline at few MyLeague matches, Myteam pulls gives you the pump when pulling a good card. While MyCareer storyline is Lame. Alternatively SHOOOOOORT and rushed. Literally RUSHED, well in fact it doesn't have any storylines at all lol. MyGM is meh, played for like 10 to 15hrs and immediately think that MyLeague still clocks on the game modes. MyPark or Rec or whatever you call it, not really my cup of tea. Never touched it not even once. Only played MyCareer without playing at the Park.

Coming from a long time 2K player on consoles.

I was expecting the same features as my console... Nope!!!
I purchased this game so I can play on my PC with my wife plays the PS5. Major regret!

Do not purchase this game, it's basically a last gen title. Many of the game features are not available, there's little to no support. 
It's unplayable, the only thing I can do is Sim as a GM.

If I could get a refund, I'd most definitely sign up ASAP!
I really hope 2K25 on PC fixes this or I like many other PC player will just pass on it!


*****EDIT: Aug. 23 2024*****:
I WOULD GIVE THIS A NEGATIVE 10 if I could!
I've been playing My league as a sim GM, now my game saves are corrupted, won't save any new game files I try to play. This was the only game mode I could actually play, and this is gone now.  TOTAL TRASH!!!
DO NOT PURCHASE, I REPEAT, DO NO PURCHASE!!! NOT EVEN WORTH IT ON DISCOUNT!!!
I would not count on 2K25 being any better for PC either, nothing has changed according to press release.
Don't let Kobe on the cover fool you, this game is utter trash!!!

Not to mention how goddamn expensive it is to make a build in this game. I don't even care about park/online, I just want to play MyCareer (which has less features than the oldest Xbox 360 games btw) and can't even have an enjoyable experience on that because you are a 60 OVR and every meaningful upgrade costs like 2k VC for a single upgrade, and on HOF with an A teammate grade I got 1k VC. I can't speak on MyLeague but no Eras sucks, adds so much replayability to be able to start from all the way back in the 1980s, so it's probably only worth if you really like the gameplay this year (again can't really comment on that cause I barely got to play lmfao).

Sports games get a lot of hate nowadays, which is why I usually purchase them myself and give them a chance, but I promise you, listen to the reviews.

The game is not only completely broken no.. they also took alot of things in the MyPlayer career away.. like the big cuties which were there, the actual quests and movies and decisions you made which were a key factor of how your career goes, the way to the draft, not to mention THE BARBER THEY TOOK AWAY ASWELL!!

There are alot of things which pisses me off about this game and honestly.. GUYS DONT SPEND ANY MONEY IN THE GAME IT AINT WORTH IT!

Well the only positive thing basically is that I will never buy it when it comes out and it's 70€ general I wonder why people would do that since at most until the year changes they will have it on sale because by this time they know they have made a bullshit.
First of all let me say I play nba for my career I like it enough that in the style of play what I don't like 2k you know what it is ? When you ruin all that experience because you want money and the ""vc"" to upgrade your player without having to play 100+ hours to get him to even 90ovr.
Anyway I don't want to dwell there since I commented on this in last year's nba2k23 but something that this is my fault since I didn't look into it and I had the same question as last year is that when I was looking at YouTube videos for my career is that I was seeing things that I didn't have in the game and I was saying to myself ""WHAT'S GOING ON ANOTHER GAME ?"" and i found out is that the game has next gen which for some reason is only supported on the new consoles and the version that the pc has is the one that is on ps4 and what is the reason for that and it doesn't support next gen on pc ""but we will lose money because then the players will need better systems to run the game....hey we meant for you we did it..."" dude 2k seriously ? it's 2024 and we're going to 2025 you're saying there are no pc's that run your shit you're making.
You 2k seriously ? it's 2024 and we're going to 2025 do you think there are no pc's that run your shit you put out every year ?
You just know that after that you might lose people and that's why you don't and won't do it.
But you know a solution that would make us all happy?
PUT THE OPTION WHO WANTS TO BE ABLE TO PLAY NEXT GEN AND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY THE OLD ONE.

NBA 2K24,2338770,169284187,"Where do I even begin with this one...

Man, back in the days, coming from NBA Live from uh.. some other big gaming publisher, I discovered the NBA 2k series back in 2006 and it was...a revelation. Miles ahead already back then in terms of both presentation and gameplay.
I've kept in touch over the years until NBA 2k16. After that, I merely watched the yearly trainwreck unfold on social media when thousands, no millions of people again flocked around the yearly NBA 2k Update.

The core of the game is still there. The animations are mostly good, the gameplay is mostly solid, apart from when it's not. Overall, on the court, you still can't find a better virtual Basketball experience to this day.
Maybe that's part of the problem.
Lack of competition makes things stale. Uninspired. Atriously bad. Oh my god, so bad.

I've always loved the idea of playing my own character and getting a feeling for how an NBA career might feel like. My go-to fantasy was always: Simon Jordan, a nephew of the great His Airness. Same family name, huge burden. He understands the implications and he's not a copy of the original, he's a great player in his own right. No, he grows into one.

This is what I am looking for, by the way, Visual Concepts, if you are reading this. The journey, the growth from a talented rookie with clear weaknesses, into a hall of fame candidate.

What are you giving me here?
The weirdest, pointless, annoying, mood-killing cut-scenes I have ever had to endure in any game. They're so bad, you can hardly even meme on them.
My player, young Mister Jordan is already in some big fancy apartment somewhere, clearly a millionaire. Surrounded by an annoying manager, girlfriend and social media lady.
""That's why your fans hate you probably, lol"", my rival Shep tells me. I didn't ask btw. No idea why this douche is my rival at all, why he seems like he is about to stab me on the way to the lockerroom. Or why my player first shrugs it off with a coolness, until my ""rival"" says: ""ha, the sun even shines on a dog's ass sometime!"" - and oh boy, suddenly my character gives him a look that should kill him, but sadly doesn't.

What the ♥♥♥♥ am I watching? Skip.

I play my first game. My player has an average rating of 70. Not great, not terrible. I somehow shoot 70 % from mid-range, but I don't know why. There is very little shot-feedback. Clearly, a step back. Let alone the fact that I am being benched for most of the 4th quarter despite having scored the most points on my team.

After the game, the season is supposed to start! Yay!
Except, no, first, I am being invited to a special club, of which only the best players can be a part of. Clearly, that's me... Mister draftpick number 18! This is where I can satisfy all my shopping needs!
...My dudes, I just want to play Basketball and have a succesful season. What is this? Metabook?
Disgusted, I try to upgrade my first ability with the 850 Virtual Coins I have earned.
There is no real money involved, yet I feel like I just got my lunch money taken from me.

I feel... disillusioned. NBA 2k 23 is a pale shadow of it's former gloryful self. The music, the menus, the lack of meaningful improvements in gameplay, a backstory that could have been done better for 5 $ by some guy/gal from Fiverr in 10 minutes.

I really really wanted to like this game, I really wanted to play some virtual basketball in 2022 (btw after 2k Games made 2k16 literally obsolete and unplayable even offline!) but I just can not stand this piece of ♥♥♥♥ garbage. For the love of Kobe Bryant please stop buying this garbage game, show the developers that this is not what we want in a game!

1. This version of 2k24 isn't even next gen, meaning the graphics are worse than a new gen console.
2. If you got the game to play on pc after owning it on Xbox you can't cross progress and must create an entirely fresh start of the one of the most grind heavy pay to win games.
3. its 2024 and you cant even play cross-platform with your console buddies.

and here is my fourth reason and solution:

4. You can get the game free and cloud play it through pc xbox game pass, meaning you don't have to download 130 gb of trash, you can play with next gen graphics and features, and also you get all of this with the ability to play cross platform with new gen consoles.

This an absolute travesty, the fact that 2k will not only give us a half a** game and decide that pc is nothing more than a money grab. They have a fully operational game to console players even this game was made on a PC is a F'ing joke. 3 times in total I've bought VC to upgrade My career, even after purchasing a 50 dollar game. They decide rather than to give us the game promoted by the devs and the community, the decide to give us a game that is literally just a revamp version of 2k21 without a functional story line and new jumpshot animation. THAT'S LITERALLY IT, if you buy 2k expecting it to somehow be a new market and have the same things console gets you're just lying to yourself. AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE MY CAREER ONLINE. The fact this game allows console players to not only have the ability to play with PC players is a joke. The Dsync is absolutely ridiculous, can't even master your own jumpshot on those games because of the fact you have to hold your release longer just to get a green. Then there is basically no room for error because a slightly late should just say ""YOU MISS B***H"". Absolute garbage, so if you want pc players to stop hacking, and to stop exploiting the bugs and glitches you already have in the game, just give the devs the right funding to do so.

Seriously, check your max attributes versus actual 90-99 rated players in the game. All to just try to get you to spend money on your build. There is no good build, your build isn't the problem, they are hoping you will think your build is bad so you try another build and spend more money.

NBA 2K24,2338770,167528489,"**NBA 2K24: A Slam Dunk of Basketball Gaming Brilliance**

NBA 2K24 continues the legacy of excellence set forth by its predecessors, delivering a basketball simulation experience that's unparalleled in its depth and realism. Developed by Visual Concepts, this installment raises the bar yet again with stunning graphics, immersive gameplay, and a plethora of features that cater to both casual fans and hardcore basketball enthusiasts alike.

**Gameplay and Realism**

From the moment you step onto the virtual court, NBA 2K24 impresses with its attention to detail. Player movements, animations, and physics are meticulously crafted to mirror the intricacies of real basketball. Dribble moves, shooting mechanics, and defensive strategies feel intuitive and responsive, allowing for strategic gameplay that rewards skill and practice. Whether you're executing a perfect pick-and-roll or sinking a buzzer-beating three-pointer, every action feels impactful and true to the sport.

**Modes and Content**

NBA 2K24 offers a wealth of game modes to keep players engaged for hours on end. The MyCareer mode returns with a compelling story-driven experience where you create your own player and navigate their journey from rookie to NBA superstar. The MyTeam mode lets you build and manage your dream team through card packs and player auctions, adding a layer of strategy and collection to the game. Additionally, the revamped MyLeague mode provides deep customization options for those who prefer to manage every aspect of a franchise.

**Presentation and Visuals**

Visually, NBA 2K24 is a feast for the eyes. Player models are incredibly detailed, capturing the likeness and unique characteristics of NBA stars with astonishing accuracy. Arenas are meticulously recreated, complete with dynamic crowds and broadcast-style presentation that enhances the immersion. Whether playing on current-gen or next-gen consoles, the game showcases Visual Concepts' commitment to pushing the boundaries of graphical fidelity in sports gaming.

**Community and Online Play**

The online multiplayer experience in NBA 2K24 is robust and engaging. Compete against friends or players from around the world in head-to-head matches, participate in online leagues, or test your skills in weekly challenges and events. The community aspect of the game is thriving, with active forums, social media integration, and regular updates that keep the gameplay experience fresh and dynamic.

**Critique**

While NBA 2K24 excels in almost every aspect, there's one area where many players, myself included, wish for improvement: in-game prices and microtransactions. The cost of virtual currency and the pricing of in-game items can feel steep at times, making it challenging for players who wish to progress or customize their experience without significant investment. Better deals and more accessible pricing options would undoubtedly enhance the overall player experience and foster a more inclusive community.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 sets a new benchmark for basketball gaming with its unparalleled gameplay, stunning visuals, and extensive content offerings. Whether you're a die-hard NBA fan or simply enjoy immersive sports simulations, this game delivers in spades. While there's room for improvement in the pricing structure, the sheer quality and depth of NBA 2K24 make it a must-have for any gaming library.

As an avid fan of basketball and the NBA 2K series, NBA 2K24 delivers an exhilarating experience that brings the intensity of the game right into your living room. The attention to detail is unparalleled, capturing every drop of sweat from the men in this game, every powerful dunk which gets the blood running, and every strategic play that makes basketball so ballin.

His movements, his skill, and even his signature style are flawlessly brought to life, making every moment on the court with him feel special.

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 is a triumph for basketball fans. It captures the essence of the sport, celebrates the talent of its athletes, and provides endless hours of entertainment. Whether you're playing with LeBron James or any other superstar, the game offers an authentic and exhilarating experience that is second to none.

NBA 2K24,2338770,167281751,"Alright, so I finally got my hands on NBA 2K24, and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed. Let’s talk about the major issues: the delay during gameplay and the insane cost of upgrading player stats.

First off, the delays are just ridiculous. Whether I’m playing online or offline, the game lags and stutters constantly. It messes with player movements, shot timing, and overall responsiveness. It’s like, come on, how am I supposed to enjoy the game when every move feels off because of the lag? Even when I'm playing offline, where you'd think it would be smooth, it still stutters. It’s really frustrating, especially when you’re trying to nail those crucial moments.

Now, let’s get into the microtransactions. Upgrading player stats in this game is just crazy expensive. Every stat point costs a ton of Virtual Currency (VC), and earning VC through gameplay takes forever. To give you an idea, bumping up a single attribute by a few points can set you back thousands of VC. If you’re not willing to shell out real money, you’re stuck grinding for hours and hours just to make a tiny bit of progress. It really feels like a pay-to-win situation, and that’s super unfair.

On the plus side, the game looks amazing. The graphics are top-notch, with super detailed player models, realistic animations, and the arenas look fantastic. But honestly, the great visuals don’t make up for the gameplay issues and the aggressive microtransactions.

There are plenty of modes to choose from, like MyCareer, MyTeam, and Play Now. But again, the fun is really dampened by the delays and the fact that you almost have to spend extra money to get anywhere in MyCareer. It’s a slog if you don’t.

In conclusion, NBA 2K24 has some serious problems. The lag makes it hard to enjoy the game, and the cost of upgrading player stats is just way too high unless you’re willing to spend extra cash. The graphics are great and there’s a lot of content, but that doesn’t make up for the major drawbacks. If you’re a huge fan of the series, you might be able to look past these issues, but for most players, it’s a letdown.

Pros:
- Amazing graphics and realistic animations.
- Lots of game modes and content.

Cons:
- Major delays and lag during gameplay.
- Upgrading player stats is way too expensive.
- Feels like a pay-to-win situation.

Honestly, unless these problems get fixed, it’s hard to recommend NBA 2K24. It’s a step back for the series, and it just feels like they’re prioritizing making money over making a fun game.",False,0,23319

I am not good at all at the game, but by the time I come in there are a lot of promo players readily available for me to enjoy available to purchase for dirt cheap in-game currency as the ""meta"" has settled in. I do not care about what players are OP, or have the best builds. I care about playing with players that I like and that I know, and until this year I have very much enjoyed my relationship with this franchise. 

But this year is the exception. With the new player market my way of enjoying this game is dead, you are limited to the players 2K says you can get (unless you buy packs with real money obviously) and they set dumb prices for them. Can you guess where the popular players are found in this economy?

If you like me, enjoyed some casual MyTeam fun, you can skip this year and probably all of the next ones, because the new way the game is handled is one of the worst changes I have ever seen any franchise make. Garbage game made by the greediest sports franchise out there, and doing that by competing with EA is quite the achievement.

The game is very good, but I got this under the assumption that the NBA Cup/In-Season Tournament would be in the game. Apparently the PS5 has it (after an update in November 2023), but the PC version for some mysterious reason does not have it despite the 100+ GB size of the game.

However, the real PA announcers all being present does lead to a very fun and realistic in-game experience.
The game feels structurally the same since NBA 2K10, the only difference being the rule changes over the years and various presentation & graphical improvements. I must note that if you want to save & quit your game, do it at the inbound pass, otherwise it won't be at the same point.

I may keep it around for when I feel like playing some basketball, but it can't truly be ""NBA 2K24"" without the NBA Cup, no? That was one of the main reasons for me getting this game. It seems to be a previous 2K with a bit more pizzazz (after some brief research, 2K22?)

Pro:
- Game works great, with some mishaps
- Create a character easy to understand, multiple options for different play styles
- Multiple options for character customization, including different brands for shoes and clothes
- Fun to shoot the ball around and ball out during games
- Fun to play park with friends in 2s or 3s

Cons:
- The game is the last gen version, which does not make sense since the PC version should be the best version in my opinion
- Connection issues in the Park / Neighborhood hurts due to having to re-enter these modes or restart
- Less on-court dialogue due to last gen version
- Less content due to last gen version

Overall:
- This game gets a 6.5 out of 10. If the game was not the last gen port, it would be higher due to the content that was cut from the PC version. The servers could be better, but I do have fun messing around either by myself or with friends.",True,0,1556

NBA 2K24,2338770,166506294,"I am here for WHOEVER is thinking of buying this game. First i would like to say that I have played EVERY Nba 2k since they came out. I have also played basketball for MANY years. Basketball is like a religion to me. For this review I am going to look at it from a PC gaming perspective. 

Is NBA 2K24 Worth Buying? The PC version of NBA 2K24 is NOT next gen, however, there are changes that have been added. It is not (no matter what people may tell u) a copy and paste of last year. Players in the game react differently to being hit in different parts of the body while in mid air, this is new. game play is MUCH smoother and not as glitching as last year when the screen gave u an eye decease when ur player dribbled down the court. Lighting is different and players may point to crowd and say something when hitting a shot is also new. The layout and menu is COMPLETELY different and I mean that in a good way. Now final thoughts. If you are looking for HYPER REALISTIC graphics and A NEW 2K WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE....than this is not what u want. But if u are looking for the LATEST rosters and some changes in game-play and some fun basketball, then heck yea, go for it. Personally I didn't get the game UNTIL it was on sale for $9.49 and may I say, it was worth it. So give it a try!",True,0,227

In the open world part of MyCareer when you try to teleport somewhere half of the time it just doesn't work, it loads for a bit and then just puts you right back to where you were. A lot of the time when just trying to open MyCareer it loses connection and I half to reconnect and it sometimes even logs me out (it keeps my login information so its not a big deal but still). So there could be a whole lot done to make this game better in those areas, but like I said I think that the gameplay part is really fun and doesn't have many issues.",True,0,27910

I literally, with every fiber of my being hereby conclude that 2K24 is the grossest wretchedest ugliest most disgusting inhumane vulgar travesty concoction of madness unholy disapointing waste of money time wasting garbage receptacle of a video game. To call this even a video game would be a trespass of what is considered good gaming or a good gaming experience. This rookie hole is so far beyond the level of autism even a man like ja morant could achieve humans can physically, mentally, spiritually not even begin to fathom how autistic this game is. The 2k staff is the most unbelievably, unskilled, horrible set of employees in the video game industry. They can't even code their game correctly. Alley oops fail to alley oop. Wretched stinky humans who don't deserve to be in the work force. They should remain subjected to the swamps of being reddit mods. They should employee some competency in their company and maybe we can bypass HOF kristaps porzingis autism blocks. Every time my beautiful thumbs move the joysticks, and I see how wretched the employees have decided that dribbling functionally is to be removed from basketball. every time I press the Y button to block derrick white, whom despite playing before the three point line, has the god given ability to drain threes like steph curry, jump 55 inches in the air as if he were prime michael jordan, and block chase down alley oops given to anthony davinci he should be game 7 iguodala lebron james chase down incarnate. Ever grazing a controller that contributed to the horrifying game play of playing a 2k24 play now match is equivalent to starving my self for 14 days, and I hate it. 2K24 Is the most threatening event since the cuban missile crisis in 1961. Every person who launches 2k24 is immediately compromised. The victim's heart beats 57 times the normal speed, seizures rapidly unfold, and tumors are actively spawning. Before the game is even launched the wretched radiation is that of a worldwide pandemic. Worse than anything ever seen before. the death toll is atleast 2,000,500,000 at minimum. The shots taken ""beyond the arc"" in 2k are so horrific it's as if I were shot in the back of the head like JFK every time the ball is released. Abraham lincoln himself ressurected from the death to give his dues to 2k staff for the ability to mind frick the back sector of your cranium every time you play this basketball american game. The assault of nanking does not compare. Every single pixel of the screens displaying this real life satanic ritual embodies the lives of the victims of nanking. Jason's taintcum omid and kris piss porpingiz are equivalent to the 4 WZ131 Bing chillin tanks in the teamen semen, and we are the single man placing ourself in front trying to stop them. Unfortunately in this timeline, the tanks 360 back flip windmill alley oop dunk without hesitation. And even though we don't actually die, I want to kill my self every time I try to play defense, but the birds remain chirping. But guys, surely you can think of something? the beta lakers create consistent offense, defense, and plays, they can concoct a master piece. They've started a non profit, spread the gospel message, sent out missionaries, feed the poor, donate their salary, and royally outplay the top G celctics in every metric, and as surely as hiroshima endured nuclear devastation assuming they could win the war, the lowmid smid lamid kermids (lakers) absolutely leg spreadingly, reality bendingly, penis slappingly, eggnoggle bogglingly, become offendors and cause more harm than R kelly, jeffrey epstein, billy cosby, ted bundy, the zodiac killer, jeffrey dahmer, and jack the ripper combined.",False,210,3828

I took a break a couple years ago. This is my first time getting back into. Every bad system has been retained and has been meticulously engineered to be worse. All of the good systems have been dropped. Games feel bad in every mode. Difficulty is no longer rewarding, it's simply a handicap. Microtransactions are rampant, and it takes 3x the amount of time to max a character relative to my experience with 2k11 all those years ago. At my current rate, it will take three full seasons to max my character without microtransactions. I'm not sure what I would max for. The online community feels empty and bitter. It feels like nobody is having fun.

If you enjoy NBA basketball and want to feel unbearably sad, pick up NBA 2k24. I wish I would have left my negative review and collected my refund while the window was open, but it's important to see that few great things last forever. An incredible heartfelt product iterated upon time-after-time will eventually become just a product. If you want to play good basketball, buy a pair of shoes and hit your local park up.

NBA 2K24,2338770,166152768,"NBA 2K24: A Steep Shot with Glittering Rewards

NBA 2K24, the latest iteration of the popular basketball simulation game, delivers an undeniably polished and exciting on-court experience. Yet, much like a dazzling alley-oop overshadowed by an overzealous traveling call, the game's brilliance is marred by intrusive monetization strategies.

For basketball purists, NBA 2K24 is a dream. The ""ProPLAY"" technology seamlessly translates real-life NBA footage into in-game animations, resulting in smoother player movement and a heightened sense of authenticity. Whether mimicking Giannis Antetokounmpo's powerful drives or Stephen Curry's lightning-quick releases, the gameplay feels incredibly responsive.

Beyond technical prowess, the variety of game modes keeps players engaged. MyCAREER, the story-driven mode where you build your own basketball superstar, boasts a revamped narrative and a vibrant city hub to explore. MyTEAM, the card-collecting mode, allows you to curate your dream roster of current and historic players.

However, the path to competitive glory in these modes feels paved with microtransactions.  The virtual currency, VC, is essential for upgrading your MyCAREER player's abilities and acquiring top players in MyTEAM. Earning enough VC through gameplay can be a tedious grind, incentivizing players to purchase it with real money. This nickel-and-diming approach casts a shadow over the otherwise immersive experience.

Ultimately, NBA 2K24 is a game of two halves. On the court, it's a slam dunk, delivering the most realistic and engaging basketball simulation to date.  Off the court, however, the aggressive monetization tactics leave a bitter aftertaste.  For casual fans, the core gameplay might be enough. But for serious players, the pay-to-win elements may feel like a foul call.

Recommendation: Purchase game off G2A.com. For die-hard basketball fans, the gameplay improvements may outweigh the monetization issues.",True,0,25796

There’s no sense in paying full price for what is basicaly the same game every year. The biggest disappointment is that for the third year in a row, 2K didnt port the new-gen version of NBA 2K to PC, even tho most PCs are as if not more powerful than a PS5.

Even at the highest settings, the game looks bad, and you’re stuck with the old-gen version, which means the entire game experience from menus to graphics to features looks worse than the PS5 version. 

If you still decide to purchase, get ready to spend more. Playing MyCareer mode is nearly impossible without spending out over $100 to upgrade your player to a decent OVR. The single-player mode in MyCareer is incredibly difficult to win unless you buy VC to improve your player and be able to compete. The opposite team can barely score 4 points in a quarter, but as soon as you're substituted out for 2 minutes, they become prime Tracey McGrady, and score 13 points in 33 seconds (which is absurd). And by the time you're back in the game, you'll be down by 20 points.",False,0,5150

NBA 2K24 is the worst and most perfunctory game ever made for players. Firstly, the scene design is almost patched together, neglecting any real effort. Secondly, the gameplay is indistinguishable from previous titles in the 2K series. MyCareer mode skips all the genuine plot elements, which is excessively disappointing. Are players spending money just to experience a game that shows no progress or growth? Is this a way to disregard 2K fans worldwide? I firmly oppose this game by 2K!

It's impressive how the same game 4 years later, has the same graphics, same animations, same overall mechanics, same loading screen cutscenes with utter time wasting bs that you can't skip or mute. I gota apply for a job at 2k, they must spend all day smoking weed or something because they sure as shit aren't improving this game. 
Despite it being the same recycled game, the directional passing in 2k24 sucks ass, 3 pointers are impossible while every AI opponent is an expert 3 point shooter, movement is sluggish af even for an nba2k game and the delay responding to the input is atrocious. But what does it for me is the rng in the release mechanic. In 2k20 I could shoot 10x and use the animation to get consistent results. Here, you can get 10x ""excellent"" in a row, and the very next training, same exact practice exercise, using the same exact timing, and you get ""early"", ""slightly late"", ""slightly early"". It's all over the place. It's almost like the game does it on purpose and just adds rng to your release window to get you frustrated and make you to buy vc to max your stats asap.

My first time purchasing and playing a 2k on pc as I usually play it on whatever the current console is, and it's literally the last Gen version of 2k24 (not the ps5 or Series X version) but they ask for retail price and have the pricey big VC versions for you to buy. The on court game play itself isn't bad other than every player moving like they have cemente boots on, and creating space with dribbling is a chore as every defender feels like MJ or Scottie Pippen locked in in a closeout game for a championship. Because this isn't the current Gen version, PC players don't get the widely popular MyEras mode where you can basically play a franchise mode in any major era like Magic & Bird, Jordan or even early 2000s era, and re-write those eras in your own way throughout past years up until now. As a 2k gamer since way before they ever had a create your own player career mode and parks and all that VC cash grab non sense, I played franchise mode heavy, so a mode like MyEras would've been awesome to play. Guess I'll just have to buy this on sale for ps5 to play that mode.

The fact that EA brought Next Gen gameplay and graphics into their PC games before 2K should let you know that 2K FUCKED UP.

Don't even get me started on the gameplay. GOD if I had a nickel for every time the game glitched out in some way, I'd be the richest motherfucker in the world. ANYTHING from the commentators calling my character by the wrong nickname, to the referees literally breaking the laws of physics and mind controlling the ball away from the players, almost as if they were playing KEEP AWAY from them, it literally STOPS THE GAME FROM CONTINUING LIKE WHAT?!

This is actually one of the worst games I've played so far this year. Thank god I didn't pay for this game at full price because this piece of shit is not anywhere CLOSE to being worth $70. If I could go back in time, I would knockout my past self and buy an actual GOOD GAME.

NBA 2K24,2338770,164842001,"I paid 9.59 for this. I ONLY PLAY FRANCHISE mode aka myleague OFFLINE. I'd try myplayer if the off ball movement wasn't so terrible and if it wasn't so painfully restrictive as far as attribute limits is concerned.

Cons: There are too many locked in forced animations that make aspects of the game too unrealistic. 

Finishing at the rim with any sort of contact is way nerfed and inconsistent.

Passing is unrealistically slow. I'm talking there's a 1-2.5 second delay from the time you press pass to when the ball is actually passed. Often times the intended recipient moves as you're passing it but not in a way that's good or helpful. They'll move into other defenders so that what ends up happening is you pass the ball DIRECTLY into a defenders hands. 

Moving without the ball is almost non-existent. Watch or play a real life game, Do people mostly stand around watching the ball handler like 2015 Rockets? No, there is constant movement, screens being set, Shooters running to an open spot behind the 3 point line when the ball handler drives and the defense collapses. Bigs drifting out of the paint to unclog the lane. Tons and tons more. This stuff rarely happens in the game. There's mostly people standing watching the guy with the ball.

After getting an offensive rebound you get trapped in this state where your player doesn't move normally. For example, let's say you grab an offensive rebound and want to immediately turn and sprint the the corner, Well the game locks you into a state where even if you jam turbo and flick the left stick to all the way it doesn't register. The player will take 2-3 short choppy steps first THEN go back to normal and actually sprint.

Offensive rebounding on the CPU is ridiculously OP. Every game without fail will have someone on the opposing team grabbing 8 offensive rebounds.  I had to lower it from 50 to 40.

Long rebounds are almost non-existent. Mostly every miss doesn't leave the paint.

The announcers are lackluster. At this point i'd rather they use AI for more dynamic reactions and commentary.

The courts are too shiny any reflective. I know it looks aesthetically pleasing but personally I find it distracting and I'd like the option to turn it off. 

Pros: When the game is clicking, ball is moving, crowd is hyped...It's fun. They did a good job with the crowd reactions

Star players perform on the court like star players. Their impact in the game is clear and noticeable. 

Conclusion: If I had paid pull price for this i'd be disappointed but for 9.59 it's  worth it for me. The game itself is fun, rewarding and challenging. I've had LeBron cook me, Curry torch me and it was awesome. Scouting the draft class, signing free agents, tracking award leaders all that stuff is still fun and interesting to me. I've been playing since the first 2k on Dreamcast and still find basketball beautiful. It's unfortunate that 2k went from a yearly must have purchase to  only buying every 2 years and on a 70 percent or more discount. I didn't play live but I sure as hell appreciated them pushing 2k to innovate. I drafted Wemby and every game I gotta hear REJECTED BY WEMBANYAMAAA!!!  7 times.
