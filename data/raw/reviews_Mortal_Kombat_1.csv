Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,210159789,"Highly Recommended: A Flawless Victory for the New Era.

The core combat has been polished to perfection. MK1 feels faster and more fluid than its predecessors, rewarding creativity and quick thinking. The biggest game-changer is the Kameo system. These assist fighters add an incredible layer of strategic depth, allowing for mind-blowing combo extensions, defensive breaks, and setup opportunities that drastically change how you approach every matchup. Mastering your main fighter and their Kameo partner provides hundreds of hours of satisfying experimentation.

If you're looking for a fighting game with a world-class story, deep and customizable combat, and visuals that will drop your jaw, look no further. MK1 is a spectacular entry, and the Kameo system ensures that competitive play stays fresh and exciting for years to come. Get Over Here! (And buy this game =p",True,0,3974

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,209406061,"Mortal Kombat 1 can absolutely be fun, and the gameplay itself is solid. The story isn’t particularly interesting, but it’s told in a way that kept me engaged.

Unfortunately, the game is heavily dragged down by microtransactions and a thick layer of forced “woke” themes that feel out of place in the MK universe. Almost all female characters were deliberately redesigned to look completely unattractive, which for me goes so far that it almost feels disrespectful toward women rather than the opposite.

On top of that, the visual tone has shifted from dark and brutal to bright, colorful, almost “Fortnite-like.” This change kills the atmosphere and even makes some Fatalities look unintentionally silly instead of shocking or dramatic.

There is a good game underneath all this. But the artistic direction and ideological polish suffocate much of what made Mortal Kombat unique.",False,5,283
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,209400370,"Been a fan and player of MK since the release of the first game in arcades. While MK X and even 11 had bumpy starts, they turned out to be okay maybe even good depending on how you look at things. MK 11 certainly had a lot of options and nice additions. I picked up MK 1 on release via console and played it for several seasons though it was a terrible release lacking a lot of standard features.

After picking the game up on sale for pc I was amazed to see how much didn't change, it's been over a year since I played this game. The ""contacting MK servers"" and errors accompanying that are still there and occur a lot especially when trying to get items or unlock mastery. I've had matches end, usually when trying to get awards, abruptly such as fighting Floyd! Invasions is a complete joke, maybe even worse than when the game first launched. The talisman thing was broken early on but you could make some powerful stuff and it really helped leveling up and beating bosses. The devs made the game not only grindy but took away a lot of the tools to aid in it. Shops have basically nothing of use (keys once were in at least one shop at different stages as an example). Limits and nerfing have been placed on creating talismans, lack of item slots, useless map (worst map I've seen in a modern game), boring as hell is the best way to describe ""invasion"".

The graphics are decent, especially tweaking the settings though it's odd the game has updated to account for a gtx 5080 giving a message talking about a 3080ti (I've never seen that in a modern game). Actual gameplay vs the computer or against a second player locally doesn't glitch or hesitate but game menus, selecting skins/items/characters has some terrible lag and delay. It probably has something to do with everything on servers but MK 11 doesn't have this issue.

Overall, MK 1 screams nrs didn't listen to fan feedback or the community. A lot of popular features and characters were not part of the game and nrs created a game that paywalled a lot of stuff. The game feels as if it is a pay-to-play moblie game with how invasions works and the slop items. Even the stances for characters are all the same (every kitana skin has the same stance as an example). The kameos are useless, take away fatality options from their playable character, lock out favorites from being playable (sonya, jax, etc), and feels as if it was an unfinished idea. Another big issue is changing characters for an agenda (cyborgs, ""cage"") which no one asked for but fans did ask for.

As a long time fan of the series I hope Mortal Kombat can get back to what made people love the game and a dev team who cares about the community gets involved.",False,2,1095

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,208988691,"I’m honestly stunned. If you (like me) have been listening to the doom-and-gloom crowd and staying away from this, let me tell you right now...they couldn’t be more wrong.

I fired up Mortal Kombat 1 for the first time yesterday (grabbed the Definitive Edition for eighteen bucks on Fanatical), and I’m honestly sitting here wondering what in the hell people have been complaining about.

I’ve been with this series since day one...since the arcades...since the sticky buttons, cigarette burns, and the magic of hearing “Finish Him” echo through a crowd...and I can tell you right now, Mortal Kombat has finally...fully...arrived.

This game is beautiful. The graphics are unreal. The animations are so fluid and natural that it feels like you’re watching martial arts cinema unfold in real time. The attention to detail is staggering...the character models, the light, the choreography, the sound of impact...everything feels handcrafted with purpose.

It’s like the franchise has matured into something extraordinary...aged and refined over decades...a vintage wine finally uncorked. You can taste every era in it, but it’s smoother, richer, and more deliberate than ever before.

And yet...I come online and all I see is people whining.

“Cyrax isn’t the same.”
“Scorpion feels neutered.”
“Raiden’s not a god anymore.”

Yeah...that’s kind of the point. Liu Kang rebuilt the timeline. The characters are different now. Their roles, their destinies...their relationships have shifted. That’s not betrayal of the lore...that’s evolution. It’s storytelling. It’s what keeps a thirty-year-old franchise from becoming a fossil.

People begged for a new direction for years...and now that we have one, they’re mad that it’s not just MK11 with a new paint job. Unreal.

MK1 isn’t MK11-2. It’s something else entirely. It’s cinematic...it’s expressive...and it’s finally found that perfect balance between classic brutality and modern flow. Every match feels alive. Every strike feels deliberate. It’s fast, but not frantic...fluid, but still weighty. You can tell NetherRealm has been tuning this craft for decades, and MK1 is where it finally all came together.

Even the story mode is a work of art. It’s not afraid to take risks or make bold choices with legacy characters. It actually explores what it means to rewrite fate...and how even gods can’t escape the cycle of conflict. For longtime fans, that’s powerful stuff.

And don’t even get me started on the production quality. The facial animation alone puts most triple-A games to shame. The sound design...the cinematography...the direction of each cutscene...this is world-class. It’s absurd that people look at all this and still cry “lazy” or “rushed.” There’s nothing lazy about this. You can feel the hours, the sweat, the passion, and the technical mastery that went into every single frame.

It’s honestly hilarious watching the same people who were probably toddlers when MK9 dropped try to tear this apart because it doesn’t spoon-feed them nostalgia in the exact flavor they wanted. Some folks just don’t know how good they have it.

As someone who’s seen this series evolve from blocky digitized sprites to what it is now...this feels like the moment Mortal Kombat reached full artistic and mechanical maturity. It’s finally confident in its own skin. It doesn’t need to prove anything anymore.

So yeah...say what you want about missing features or roster choices, but from where I’m standing, this is the most visually refined, fluidly animated, and thoughtfully built Mortal Kombat game ever made. It’s the first time the words fighting game and art form can sit in the same sentence without irony.

For eighteen bucks, I’m sitting here absolutely blown away by the craftsmanship...and I honestly can’t relate to the constant negativity surrounding this masterpiece.

Mortal Kombat 1 isn’t just another sequel...it’s the culmination of everything this franchise has been trying to become since 1992.

So maybe...just maybe...stop nitpicking long enough to appreciate what’s actually in front of you. Because this isn’t a failure...this is an arrival.",True,5,1733

I saw it in the trailer and thought Tag Team had returned but that's a me issue. The gameplay is solid and the story is interesting enough, at least until Act 3.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,208902491,"THIS GAME IS A PILE OF SHIT

i have to say this is the worst mortal kombat game by far, the kombat is absolutely trash the kombos are not made for casual players which prevents it from being a fun game to play to just kill some time, its clear the kameos and heaps of dlc characters are purely for monetary gain also the kameo characters could just be tag team like mk9 but no netherrealm saw a possible business venture and ruined what could have been a genuinely fun and useful mechanic on top of this the story of these games is getting so boring and repetitive its just the same time travel multiverse shit we see done everywhere in modern media that completely removes the stakes (as if mortal kombat had stakes to begin with) this game simply feels like a big fat reminder that the gaming industry is quickly abandoning its roots of fun providing to lean into more and more lazy cash grabs that require a rocket science phd to play properly i desperately hope whatever netherrealm shits out next is actually fun and satisfyiong to play and proves me wrong in my thinking that theyre just another greedy gaming corp that simply wants nothing but a quick buck

edit: also wtf is with all the dlcs costing as much as their own individual games when most likely they offer 5 minutes of unique gameplay to then just rub salt on the open wound it slashed directly down the centre of your ballsack from repeating all the problems previously discussed

another edit: this game SEVERELY lacks the replay value of the last games for examlpe mk9 was my first mk game ever and i must have spent hours upon hours playing it with my dad and as ive grown up ive revisited it and had phase after phase of falling in love with the game again similar to mkx i have around 150 hours on steam due to how much it initially gripped me and from revisiting it as the years have gone by and i vividly remember the excitement i felt when the mk11 trailer dropped and i saw raiden obliterate scorpion before another scorpion appeared then when it actually came out i was amazed when i could actually play as shao khan, fast forward to the release of mk1 it was far too expensive to get right away so i had to wait or a while and watch yt vids of the gameplay and the new kameo shit building interest and intrigue, when i got the game my pc at the time could barely run it but i tried to push through and maybe excused a bit too much of the shitty game on the pc but now i have a way stronger setup ive revisited it and i can confidently say i had the worst experience ive ever had with a mk game and i will not be reinstalling it and replaying it countless times like i have with the other ones",False,0,739

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,208746718,"We WUZ Mortal kombat n sheeeet. If i were to summarize MK1 into 3 words it would be laziness, disappointment and greed.

Story:
Story is slightly better than in MK11 however after halfway its same shit as in MK11. Timeline go BRRRRRRRR. The best way how to continue story when you have lost all creativity and ideas is  Timeline/Multiverse and sheeeet. Chapter 15 is MEME, i dont know why developers have to put this zoomer humor into every fucking serious franchise. MK isnt fucking Street Fighter for kids. DLC story was ok only because of Havik however you have been forced to play 2/3 of story as the most disgusting character in the game (Tanya).

Characters:
All female characters except the black one, looks like that disgusting bitch from Ghost of Yotei. Raiden and Kung Lao models are same, Scorpion and Sub-Zero models are same. Developers forgot why is Megan Fox famous and i can tell you its not Acting/Voice Acting. Customization is far worse than in MK11. Race and Gender swap for Cyrax and Sector,

I remember my grandmother saying to me ""I dont care what they tell you in school""  Cyrax was black woman. As it was not enough they gave her the most generic ""African tribe"" accent. There are only few characters which kept their design from previous game unfortunately most of them are cameo characters which you cannot play.

Content:
Towers with modifiers are ok however they are extended with TYM event which is doing nothing despite of your success or failure. Krypt has been replaced by Invasions which was the biggest mistake. I finished one invasion and i have had enough. When i bought this game i expected fighting and not fucking pinball/zombie/arcade minigames. When you expect me to do combo trials 100 times with character i have never ever played before, at least remove that fucking stage loading and ""YOU LOSE"" animation.

Cameo system:
During fights you can call your cameo (second character)  fighter to perform some moves which can extends/fuck up your combos or can give you some additional effects like armor and so on. I dont understand why developers havent finished them and not gave them full move set and made them playable as it was in MK9. Is it too much to ask for?

Conclusion:
Netherrealm studios made Mortal Kombat franchise from game which you turned on when you wanted to play against other people on Friday night to full time daily job where you have to farm character levels to unlock Fatalities/Brutalities and Skins in stupid minigames but dont worry you can visit their Microtransaction shop to make it less painful. I strongly hope that they will let MK rest in peace and move on to butcher another franchise.",False,2,2311

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,208704984,"Same 1v1 fights with friends are fine — the combat still has that classic MK punch, and the cameo system is somewhat refreshing (mostly because Madame Bo is funny as hell — hope it doesn’t return in future titles though). The graphics are solid too (except for the new outfits... God forbid they show anything, huh). But that’s about all the good I can say.

The whole thing is way too focused on online play and grind. Hiding extra fatalities or any non-cosmetic character features behind grind or paywalls is just a huge dick move. Ever since MK9, every new entry has been getting worse. The guest characters this time? What a joke. T-1000 and Ghostface are cool, sure — but the rest? Really? Really?

Another rebooted storyline.  Everywhere you look — microtransactions. It honestly feels like NRS is trying to sell us a demo just so they can charge full price later for “bonus” DLC characters. They’re turning into EA at this point. This starts to become a trend in fighting games too, unfortunately, but I hate this trend - if I buy a game I want to get the full game, not having to grind forever for each character separately to just get the full experience of that character, when I'll be bored as hell with playing the character.

But the worst part of all? The complete rewriting of iconic characters.
Liked Scorpion? Surprise — it’s not Hanzo Hasashi anymore, it’s Sub-Zero’s brother.
Raiden? Just a regular guy now.
Shang Tsung? Basically a wandering con artist.

You just don’t do that. You don’t butcher the characters people have loved (and loved to hate) for decades and just turning them into completely different characters. That’s the real fatality here.

I could forgive all of the rest  but this? Turning Mortal Kombat into a grindy, microtransaction-infested mobile app on PC? That killed my love for the series. It's even worse than the change part of characters into some zombies in MK11.

I’ve been a diehard MK fan since the very beginning. I survived MK4, I survived the Game Boy version, I survived Jarek instead of Kano and even Hsu Hao. But this time... I’m out.
NRS performed a perfect, cruel fatality — on my fandom. I'm afraid this is goodbye, it's time to change franchises for me.",False,0,334

Nope, essentially you are paying pretty much the same price for the upgrade as someone coming in without a copy previously.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,207889824,"Fun to play, especially if you're coming from MK11, holds up pretty similar but with a few new features, the addition of a kameo character (which is also a fun way to make a nod to characters that would otherwise not make the roster) and the characters feel familiar yet still fresh and changed up. Story is decent enough, entertaining, love seeing Liu Kang's new timeline and the final mission in the story mode (no spoilers) is pretty fun tbh with how they made the ""new characters"". Only downsides i'd say overall is that some of the characters aren't as fun as before, to me Scorpion doesn't feel as fast as he used to in 11, and the story is nice, but feels like it almost could've been a DLC of mk11, if abit long. Also, Jax is missing from the roster and is only there as a kameo, which is disappointing, but I don't play Jax so that is only a issue if you main him. Either way, the game handles well (given that it even runs on my POS pc) and I really like how the characters are remade and reimagined, and most of the outfits feel on point.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,207819069,"I'm an old-school MK fan, ever since Mk2 on Sega I've been playing every game in the series. With Mk1, looking at its release quality and the predatory monetization practices they implemented soon after, I decided to wait a while and only recently picked it up on sale.

The game looks gorgeous, I kinda enjoyed the story mode (not the DLC part though, it's horrible beyond any words), I like the roster, I don't mind the grind and the customization system is fine by me. But no matter what I do I just can't have fun with this game at all, which is pretty sad and frustrating. And the issues this time are not so much on the surface, so it took me a while to figure it out why it feels so bad to play MK1 for me.

[b]I came to a conclusion that the game is just... too hardcore for me, and not in a fun way[/b]. With thousands of online matches in MKX and MK11, I just can't get a grasp on this one, and most importantly I don't want to cause it doesn't feel rewarding.

All the mechanics that currently piled up in the game, and the way they're implemented, and all the long-standing issues, they all together smothering me as a player from all sides. It's like I'm mostly fighting against the game rather than my opponents. I mean, how in such a dynamic game am I supposed keep in mind:
[list]
[*][b]Cameo moves and their shitty delayed inputs
[*][b]Move enhancements
[*][b]Fatal blows
[*][b]Cameo fatal blows
[*][b]Desperate moves
[*][b]Perfect blocks and upward blocks
[*][b]Extra-mechanics of every character on the roster [/b](stances, cancels, trap-setups, portals, you name it)
[/list]

All of this + remembering your regular combo strings and specials.
All of this + your attack won't hit cause the game has no actual hit/hurt boxes and uses cheap solution in form of polygon mesh collision instead.
All of this + sloppy online connection.
All of this + some stings in combos don't schedule for no clear reason and require absurdly precise input timings after the character recovery.
All of this + bdf/bfd/dbf... specials that are difficult to pull off consistently. 


[b]NOW AT WHAT POINT CAN I ACTUALLY FOCUS ON JUST PLAYING AND ENJOYING THE GAME?[/b]


When between all that cognitive load do I have a window to actually think about my opponent's actions, about my or their mix-ups, about zoning, and everything else that fighting games are about? How many hundreds of hours do I need to learn all of the above on the muscle memory level and switch my mind to something that is actually fun in the game?

And then I'm comparing this to previous games, MKX and MK11, where it took just a fragment of these efforts to consistently pull off beautiful satisfying combos that involve several different specials and basic attacks.

I remember how I used to main Erran Black and there was a not so hard string that includes almost all the character gimmicks - shooting, acid, rifle butt strikes, slides. Or MK11 Geras string that I used to spam online that had bed of spikes, time freeze and sand portal in it - all you wanna see from your boi.

Now in MK1 it feels like you have to do twice the effort, and the string you get would be something like ""punches combo, legs combo, one special that basically looks and feels like a normal attack, more punches, same special"". Make it twice as long by slapping a cameo extender after learning its unintuitive timing by heart.


It just doesn't feel worth it to learn all of it to start having fun, not for me at least.",False,24,3957

My favorite Mortal Kombat game so far.

+ Breathtaking next-gen graphics.
+ Super refined gameplay.
+ Incentives to keep playing with rewards and seasons.
+ The best Mortal Kombat story to date.
+ The music is excellent.
+ The return of the Animalities.
+ The much-talked-about character partnership doesn't bother me at all, it's something different, a breath of fresh air.
+ It's perhaps the best-looking fighting game of this generation.

- The Krypt is missing, something iconic that should be present.

I recommend it to all beat 'em up lovers.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,207486565,"A VERY EPIC STORY!!!!

Before you consider playing Mortal Kombat 1, I would highly recommend that you play Mortal Kombat X and 11 (including the Aftermath DLC story for MK11) for the full experience! If you still own a PS3 or Xbox 360 console then I would also include MK9 AKA Mortal Kombat (2011). 

Now onto the review itself; 

This is the most cinematic Mortal Kombat game to date! The visuals are incredibly stunning, the designs are far more vibrant compared to any other MK games. The voice acting was top notch in my opinion and the story is just captivating. This was truly a love letter to the entire Mortal Kombat franchise, especially if you had played the older games in the PS2 era. I will not say anything about the story because this is something you should play blind like I did. 

The gameplay was butter smooth! The developers implemented a ""Kameo"" system where you can call a companion to attack your opponent with one strike to help escape an intense combo attack from the opponent or to simply support your attack momentum! A very small feature yet it feels refreshing and WOW the fatal blows (x-rays) and fatalities are insane as always!  The character roster is great, the sound effects is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and what is more to say???

If you really want to know what the flaws are, I can only say that some characters did feel a bit sluggish but that is a me thing like obviously some characters are a learning curve to master their move sets. This time around unfortunately there are no stage interactions but it is forgivable with the amazing smooth gameplay. 

Once again, this was a love letter and a Komplete experience! I cannot wait to play the Khaos Reigns DLC story now, highly recommend this game! Please play the previous Mortal Kombat games at the very least MK11 and the Aftermath DLC.

The history is about timelines.....again, this is all the NetherRealm wrriters knows about? it gets tiring, outside of that i don't remember a single thing of the story.
The Gameplay is very fun, playing Raiden, Omni Man and GhostFace feels good to play
Invasions it's just the World Of Light mode from Smash Ultimate from Temu and with pretty visuals, first season was interesting but after that, i lost the interest of that mode.
The Roster, comparing to Mk11 feels really small (and it is), feeling like the game isn't worth the price
Denuvo....need to say more? 2 year old game and Denuvo is still there

Now the Steam Deck part review:
Steam Deck verified? more like Steam Deck TERRIFIED
it's reaaaaaally dependent of Lossless Scalling to even get 60 fps and with terrible implementation of FSR and Intel XeSS, without LS you get 40ish-50ish (if your really lucky to get 50) fps with everything to low and upscaling.
Best visuals than the Switch port (except blurriness) but worse fps so big nono if you want to play online.
how is it possible that this game is set to verified and Mk11, a game that can run with very high settings is set to uncompatible?

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,207424390,"Mortal Kombat 1 – The Perfect Example of Sitting on Two Chairs and Falling Between ThemMortal Kombat 1 tries so desperately to please everyone that it ends up pleasing absolutely no one. It’s not Mortal Kombat anymore — but it’s not Fortnite or Foamstars either (thank God, I guess). The tragedy? It can’t even reach the chaotic brilliance of Concord, which now feels like divine design compared to this confused reboot.They wanted to “modernize” the franchise but ended up neutering it instead. The game bends over backward to be edgy and “inclusive,” gritty and sanitized, nostalgic and progressive — all at once. The result? A Frankenstein of tone, half a fighting game and half a corporate DEI brochure.There are still too many men (though, thankfully, almost no white ones — small mercies). But don’t worry, we’ll “fix” that soon: make Janet Cage the main character, turn Johnny into her cameo, gender-swap Liu Kang, Raiden, and Kung Lao into lovers, and replace Sub-Zero, Smoke, and Scorpion with three first-year “strong and independent sisters” from the “Freeze, Burn, and Shatter the Patriarchy” clan. Let’s remove Fatalities entirely and replace them with Equalities — Babality and Friendship for everyone!Because that’s what this new “broad audience” wants, right? Spoiler: no, it doesn’t. The mythical, mass-market audience the managers dream of doesn’t exist. And even the real casual audience — unless they’re coming straight from Candy Crush Saga — also wants something visceral, stylish, and authentic. Something that feels like Mortal Kombat, not a PR experiment.So congratulations, NetherRealm. You’ve managed to turn one of gaming’s most unapologetically brutal and iconic series into a confused, soy-flavored spectacle of self-censorship and misplaced ideals.Welcome to Mortal Kombat 1 — the game that forgot who it was, and in trying to become everything, became nothing.",False,0,1951

this whole thing is so sacharine, such a tame calm disney level story I swear I kept thinking it was the avengers.  

The infinite race and gender swapping is actually okay with the way the multiverse works you will see some incredible and inoffensive amalgamations of all you favorite characters, It actually really fits here better than almost anywhere else I  have seen it implemented. 

But its the story man, I played for over 10 hours before someone died, And the game flat out refuses to make any judgement call about any act. No one is really a bad guy, its like saturday morning cartoons, where all the badguys were just misunderstood and given a chance and made friends with the good guys, and no one ever does anything bad or wrong (until the expansion but even then its very tame). 

Gameplay wise its ok, middle of the road some better some worse, I don't think its as fun as x or 11, it feels like an intentional step back. Itsw gonna be a matter of taste here.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,206796985,"I'll start by saying that I really wanted to like this game but just couldn't. MK1 has easily been the quickest to put down compared to MK11 and MKX. I was just not having fun anymore. I'll ignore the usual MK launch shenanigans which plagues all MK games. You can go read about them online, it was literally unplayable when released. Took ages to matchmake with someone, no crossplay, desyncing issues, audio desync, etc.

Invasions sucks. Krypt should be a staple in all MK games.
Kameo system is interesting but not fun. It's boring to press the same button and do the same moves again. Also to pay for some Kameos is an absolute joke. At best they should've been unlocked through game progressions.
DLC being £40 is laughable.
Crossover characters were the focus in the DLC. Base characters were forgotten and not so polished.
Story is just bad. As expected when going down the road of timelines and alternative universes.
Graphics were great, hopefully they keep this level for their next game.

Story mode? Short but cinematic as hell. Liu Kang really out here playing God and rewriting everything.
Kameo system? Honestly a cool idea — adds variety and some wild combos once you get used to it.

Yeah, balance isn’t perfect, and online sometimes feels like I’m fighting the Wi-Fi instead of the opponent 😅

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,206205171,"Overall:
I definitely consider this my favorite Mortal Kombat game so far. It has the best skins and the story is overall also not so bad. 
The gameplay is alright, the Kameo system is something new, but it's quite alright in my eyes.
The music is also great, along with the new fighting stages.

My recommendation:
Buy the Definitive Edition, when it gets a discount, and then log in with your Warner Bros Account, and when you play the PlayStation version for example, you can use the same account to log in and get all your stuff over to the other platform, as everything is synced.

Shop:
The main currency are Dragon Krystals, they are not synced at the same time on all platforms, they are stored on the platform, where they were originally bought from, and can be used to buy Premium skins or Accessories, and the best part: the items you buy, are directly synced to the account cloud, so you can use them on any platform you play, a big plus.

Skins:
But as a long fan of the MK-franchise, I am very happy to see, that for some fighters, skins from the older games have been brought back to the store, which shows, that the developers care about the older games and are bringing parts of them back to the newer generation.

Performance:
I play MK1 mainly on the PS5, because in my opinion, the PS5 shows the best graphics qualities and it runs better.
The Steam version is just as good, there are some minor issues, but I prefer the console port overall.

And I'm glad we finally got a proper look at Outworld )

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,206142075,"Okay so this review is coming from a long time MK fan but a Kasual fighter gamer. I am recommending it but only at a discount like what I got it at.

I enjoyed the story (Part 1 and its fun finale), the slower pace of the fights took some getting used to but its okay, the graphics are very nice.
The plot was pretty entertaining and I do like the overall lore of the MK games. Its just something I enjoy. I do like SOME of the updated designs like Liu Kang. I do appreciate theres lots of skins but I wont be grinding them out or buying them.
But thats all the positives really. The main reason I recommend it, is for the Story. I treated it like an 8 hour story game and thats it.

Now for the negatives. I hate the Kameo system. Truly. Its repetitive and feels clunky. The Kameo characters are utterly pointless, badly made and I engaged with it as little as possible. The designs and flat out redesigns of some characters is baffling. Some characters look flat out awful now or at best no longer even are who they are supposed to be. And a lot  look rather bland or generic. The part II Khaos story was boring and I find myself wishing it would end. Which is in contrast to the Part 1 which I enjoyed immensely. Also as a side note, apparently 'Khaos' basically means having a mohawk, bad skin and utilising ugly colours in your skins. I do not enjoy the invasion board game thing at all. Its slow and monotonous and I gave up half way through the first one after the tutorial. The crypt is also completly absent.

As others have stated this is I think this is just inferior to MK11 in almost every single way. I bought this game at a STEEP discount and thats the only reason I enjoyed it and recommend it. Im glad I waited 2 years to play it. It was not worth full price. I will now uninstall it and never touch it again most likely.",True,14,649

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,205614231," [b]A Fresh Start That Delivers the Brutal Goods [/b]

After 6 hours with Mortal Kombat 1, I can confidently say NetherRealm has successfully rebooted the timeline without losing what makes this franchise iconic.

 [b]The Good: [/b]
The graphics are genuinely impressive. Every bone-crunching fatality, every facial expression during story cutscenes, and the environmental details all showcase how far the series has come. The gore looks sickeningly good (in the best way possible), and the character models are some of the best I've seen in a fighting game.

What really surprised me was how well the story integration works. Instead of feeling like an afterthought, the narrative gives context to why you're fighting and makes you actually care about the roster. The timeline reset opens up interesting character dynamics and relationships that feel fresh, even for longtime fans. It's not just ""here's a ladder mode with some cutscenes"" - there's genuine effort to make the story matter.

[b]The Recommendation: [/b]
If you enjoy fighting games with actual substance beyond just the combat, or if you're a returning fan curious about where the series goes after MK11, this is absolutely worth your time. The combination of satisfying gameplay, visual spectacle, and a story that respects your intelligence makes this an easy recommendation.

 [b]Verdict:  [/b]MK1 proves you can teach an old franchise new tricks while keeping its spine-ripping soul intact. Recommended.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,205495694,"I stopped playing Mortal Kombat 1 a while ago, but I still felt like I needed to leave a review.

The story mode was a highlight. It was over the top in the best Mortal Kombat way and did a good job reimagining familiar characters in this new timeline. Fights felt intense and flashy, and landing brutal combos or finishing moves never really got old.

Positives. The combat system is fast and fun, with a lot of depth if you want to put in the time to learn it. The new Kameo mechanic adds variety and makes matches feel fresh. The visuals and presentation are excellent, and the story is entertaining enough to keep you engaged from start to finish.

Negatives. The online experience is where the game started to drag for me. Too many matches came down to people spamming the same combo or move over and over, which got frustrating instead of fun. It sometimes felt less like testing skill and more like testing patience. Balance could also be inconsistent depending on the characters you faced, and matchmaking did not always feel fair. Also, some of the post launch content and balance decisions were mixed and it felt like the game struggled to find its footing after release.

Overall, Mortal Kombat 1 gave me plenty of good moments, especially in the story and casual play. But the online side of things made me step away sooner than I expected. I still think it is worth playing if you enjoy the series or fighting games, but be prepared for the online environment to be hit or miss.",True,1,21096

I get that the intended way to balance this out was to use the Talismans and Relics to buff yourself up, but after over 20 hours of playing through Invasions, I still don't have anything to help me break through super armor.

i played through the first part of the story to the end and the plot felt forced especially at the end. played a bit of invasion before it felt boring after about 4 fights lmao!! got my ass handed on the mesa maps and that's fine since i haven't mained a character yet (also haven't played online coz i haven't mained anyone).

the fights seem slower, the fatal blows feel even slower, there's no krashing blows with xrays, the amplify button has changed because of the cameo button, there are no fight options without CAMEOS, the kombos are not as good as the ones in mk11, there is no krypt, the art style feels more cartoonish and misses the mk signature gore + violence and dark themes. the ui is actually the equivalent of rainbows and sunshines lol.

I do not want to shine with my playtime here, I only want to provide credibility for the fact that I am a rather experienced MK player and, in fact, not a Noob [spoiler] Saibot [/spoiler] 
I have a total of around 500 hours on this game, previously played on PS5 and now PC. Also, I have over 5000 hours on MK11 on PS4/5 as we speak. As someone who has been playing the game at launch and now again after the Khaos Reigns DLC, I fundamentally disagree with the general opinion of most diehard Mortal Kombat fans about this game being worse than 11 or X, even though I felt the same way at launch, so let me take a deep dive into: 1. The controversial woke genderswap DEI Cyrax and Sektor situation + the controversial story ending (no spoilers) 2. Netherrealms supposed greed (spoiler: its WB, their publisher) and the kameo feature 4. the current state of the game (for both online and solo players)

Oh boy, lets start with the most controversial one: Cyrax and Sektor (previously being badass ninja robots) are now females in nanosuits, one is of african origin and one is chinese. Let me be straight forward: They could have just added in their previous variants and we would have all been okay with that nonetheless woke af move, but they did NOT deliver, they made it even WORSE!! by adding in their previous variants for the KAMEO VARIANTS OF CYRAX AND SEKTOR I AM NOT JOKING! However, here is the real problem, which is our perspective of everything: would we, as a 12 year old boy who just started this game. really have cared about stuff like that at all? Nope, we would have had an amazing time. Of course its woke and trust me I am annoyed too, but anyone not familiar with this movement or simply from a generation below us simply does not see things the same way we do, and we have to accept that I guess. I feel like this game and MK11 suffer the fate of Star Wars Episode 3. (for those who do not know what I mean, that movie was seemingly hated by most and presumably worse than 4,5 or 6, when in reality, all of the children absolutely loved Episode 3 more than anything else, they were just too young to express themselves. About 8-10 years after the release the movie (and the actor of Anakin) were finally given the praise and love they deserved.

About the ending: It was an absolute pleasure to see the story end up being a huge nod to all the oldschool fans, and I absolutely loved it. Please do not listen to others and have your own opinion is all I want to say here.

2. I do not intend to sugarcoat anything here: this game was being sold as a HUGE cashgrab over the years, waiting for the DLC characters and gatekeeping so many skins to have them added into the ingame store later on - horrible to say the least. But now in 2025 with the definitive edition out, this game is finally komplete enough to be enjoyable. The tutorial of this game is hands down the best tutorial of any fighting game ever made, so even though the learning curve is still crazy (especially playing ranked), the devs REALLY cooked with this one. My friends (who have never touched a fighting game before) joined me after kompleting the tutorial and now we are beating each other in King of the Hill matches every evening (KotH is a gamemode in which the player who wins keeps on fighting other kombatants, essentially being the ""King"" of the lobby.), and while they are having the time of their lives hitting their first kombos (the kameos help new players a lot which is not a bad thing in my opinion as a tryhard will instantly kick your sh** in as soon as you do unsafe stuff anyway lol), I am having the time of my life learning new characters and making my friends rage. For MK beginners: This will be the most rage inducing game you will ever play, and you will love it after getting ur first wins. 

[spoiler] EDIT: I HAVE BEEN PRACTICING FOR 10 HOURS TO GET BEAT THE FCK UP BY A GUY NAMED ""uWuBoy2009"" IT LEAVES STAINS ON UR MENTAL HEALTH [/spoiler] 

The kameo feature, which has been absolutely HATED by most of us at launch (including me) is now really fun to play around with and negate some of your main characters weaknesses. Yes, it should have been either a tag team game or just a normal MK, hell, there is so much wasted potential in the franchise as a whole and the kameos are proof of that: why give us ""kameos"" instead of fully playable characters? Now, nobody cares about how ur kameo looks because you rarely even see it and even if you do, you would have to be concentrating on the enemy and not their kameo. To come to an end: The kameos are additional attack inputs for your main you can use to start,extend (or drop) combos, or play mind games with your enemy, nothing else. You could go online without ever using them and kick ass just because you know your character.

4. the current state of the game: As of 09/19/2025, Cyrax, Havik, Noob Saibot and Ermac are undoubtedly the top 4 characters in the game, which obviously does not mean you are a noob for playing them (try hitting a kombo on Noob even ONCE) or that you will instalose against them. In this game, knowledge beats anything, and while you may think during your journey that the enemies are using OP or unblockable stuff on you, it is in fact a huge skill issue and you just need to learn how to outplay all the characters. If you are a kasual player, MK11 was definitely a lot easier than this game, but nonetheless you have an (now fun, back in the days annoying af) invasion mode, and towers of time in which you can unlock over 322 skins as we speak and get your reps with your main in. 

For online players: As a Noob, prepare to get wrapped up like a burrito and 
[spoiler] EMBRACE KHAOS! [/spoiler] embrace the rage you will feel while playing this game online. You will catch up with the people. Give it time, give it practive and dedication and you will be hooked to Mortal Kombat for the rest of your life.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,203905106,"This game could have been something great. A shame to see it fall short with fans. Gameplay can only do so much, it was fun but the story was all over the place. I'm a new fan but grew up with cousins that enjoyed the previous installments, I figured I could link up with them and enjoy a fresh story. Boy, what a story. I think it's unfortunate that so many of us are tired of the Multiverse plotline. Marvel at least took the time to set up some of their movies before executing the idea. Right out the gate this game does multiverse shenanigans that continue into their DLC content. I feel like had the writers took their time, somethings could have been better realized. 

Something that was interesting (and later flopped) was the different takes of the same characters. I thought it was neat and refreshing but then confusing when you have legacy characters like Hanzo (Scorpion) being swapped for Kuai Liang (Sub Zero). Some motives were funky. I havent played the DLC yet and, honestly, with how much the fandom enjoyment has dwindled, I'm not in a rush to purchase it.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,203847658,"What can I say?

The gameplay sucks. But honestly, that's usually the case with NRS games, they just have this stiff, wooden feel that isn't super fun. That said, the basic systems in this game do make it pretty easy for even a masher like myself to do some half-arsed juggles, which is nice.

The really unfortunate part is the plot. Yeah, I know, no one expects the plot in an MK game to be fine art but one does expect it to be enjoyably cheesy. Unfortunately in the case of this game it's just poorly written in a way that isn't particularly fun. There is a lot of yapping and most of it does not flow very well.

Beyond that, the voice acting is quite atrocious. Most characters get their chance to utter a line or two that sound completely off-tone for the scene at hand but only Nitara, voiced by the ""illustrious"" Megan Fox, manages to sound like a poor quality text-to-speech system from a decade ago 100% of the time.

Game's very enjoyable with friends locally/online/stream remote. Playing online is... sometimes frustrating because a lot of people learn one combo and spam it in-game and unless you know the counter you're kinda screwed. I also recommend learning one fighter character fully if you want to give online a shot, because that will increase your chances of winning dramatically, even against sweats and one-combo spammers, regardless of you knowing the match-up in full, or just your own fighter. It's better to play kasual mode instead of ranked, ranked has way more one-combo sweats.

The mechanics and certain aspects like kameos etc will be debated, but overall I really like this game.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,202744890,"Sadly, I cannot recommend this game. As a long-time fan of the series, I have played every Mortal Kombat game that has been released on PC. I have over 1,000 hours in MK11, and I bought this one right after its release.

Bringing back characters that weren't in the previous installment of the game like Ermac, Ashrah, Li Mei or Havik was a great idea, the graphics are really decent and the gameplay would be fine too, however, a few key changes make the game drastically lose its value.

Firstly, the Kameo characters – I understand the idea behind this, but it completely doesn't fit the Mortal Kombat playstyle. I often found myself completely ignoring the existence of these characterss, both solo and ranked, despite the advantages they offer. From what I understand, the game was originally intended to be Injustice 3, which didn't happen for reasons unknown to me. While this idea could have worked in Injustice, here it's a completely unnecessary addition that poorly justifies the lack of more iconic characters like Kano, Sonya, or Goro.

Secondly, there's a lack of any solo play content. In the previous installment, we had the Crypt and Towers of Time, which easily sufficed for hours of gameplay. There was grinding, that's true, but it was rewarded with cosmetic items. In MK11, we could customize our weapons, masks, and even our character's intro/outro, which provided a unique customization for every player. In this game, everything was hidden behind greedy monetization, with time-based called ""Invasion"" events that were incredibly boring with stupid and frustrating puzzles and the rewards were maybe one unique skin, while the rest were recolors of the base skins. Overall, compared to MK11, this installment feels completely neutered. Even MK10 had more to offer.

The final issue is the discontinuation of support for the game after the release of the first and last DLC, which was unsustainably expensive for its content, leading the studio to complain that the add-on sold poorly.

I hope the next Mortal Kombat will be more thoughtful. It's okay to play occasionally, but there's nothing here that will keep players engaged for enough long time.",False,40,12642

It can be entertaining, but for some reason since the great restart with MK9 it is evolving the bad way. If I had it as the only fighting game, it could serve its purpose, but with MK9-MK11 on board, this one gets uninstalled just after completing the story.

Weakest story arc of the series (and this is coming from cheezy B-movie like stories of other games). Overall atmosphere feels kind of toned down from the heavier, more grave, atmospheres of other games to more of a bright one - almost kids-friendly, shallow and naive. Has some good moments, but overally meh. On the other hand, visual presentation is almost breathtaking - good graphics, cinematic AF, amazing animations, detailed facial expressions.

I had given MK1 various chances unlike just bashing the game the first years but they just keep making terrible balance decisions and i am getting tired:
Peacemaker which i out of my own guilt pleasure played and had fun for all the wrong reasons, Homelander being released with glitches and infinites until he got fixed 2 months and wasn't even banned at evo, Cyrax and T1k recently and kameos like Tremor who were super good wtih Sindel just got buffed and now you see only him played with most of the cast and now you get Stryker doing better recharge again and a gun special that literally does 60 or 50% combo damage for very little effort like Cyrax on prepatch, i play for fun Ghostface just for being a fav. Of mine and he as broken stuff too, maybe someday he will be ruining the game if they buff him which i think they might sadly do with the previous mistakes, some patches thankfully are right, but they always pull a buff that makes 1 or 2 kameos the best choice for most of the cast or 2 super good characters being the must pick choice, play for fun at your risk, but if you wanna play a serious competitive game, just play something else, said by a average tourney player who roleplays Baraka and Ghostface.",False,0,30257

Edit: It didn't grow on me. It feels like my feet are in cement and the game feels clunky. It's plagued with inconsistency and it's no wonder it wasn't popular.

Kameos? Honestly, they’re still kinda unnecessary in my opinion, but I can’t deny they add some fun and variety. If you’re into experimenting with playstyles, they’re actually a nice addition. Story-wise… nah, my opinion hasn’t changed. Still not a fan of how they handled it, but hey, if you’re buying MK1 for the story, you’re doing it wrong. This game shines when it comes to fighting.

Seeing all the different animalities are entertaining.

Invasions mode is better than the story as there are variations in gameplay mechanics involved, however I later found out that all my progress has been deleted with the introduction of a new season, which instantly put me off playing any further.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,201592417,"It's astonishing how NRS can make game this fun and manage to ruin with so much dump shit and greediness. The core gameplay is my favorite of any MK game. Originally I didn't think I'd like the kameo system at all, but it quickly grew on me. Making/developing combos has never been more fun though kameo system does have problems especially concerning balance. Still the gameplay styles are lot more diverse than in previous MK games where everyone spammed the same 1 or 2 combos per character.

Also I love that this game has proper air combos. 

So the gameplay is really great, graphics are amazing and I also enjoyed the story more than in previous installments. It was nothing mind blowing, but I enjoyed the new spins on the characters.  I didn't enjoy the multiverse aspect of it, but I understand why they lean into it.

Sound design in this game is also probably one of the best from any games. The sounds feel real but extremely satisfying and the amount detail they put into it is astonishing.

So what went wrong then? Firstly they added so much dump stuff all across the game. Both of invasions and towers of time would be great gamemodes if it weren't for extremely infuriating mini games and game designs like the element system that has no place or purpose in a fighting game like MK. Most of the modifiers are only annoyances that disrupt the core gameplay. Also both Tower of time and invasion are ridiculously easy even the very hard towers unless you get a character boss that has your weakness element meaning you deal abysmal damage and their shields do more damage to you than you do with constant long combos.  Not to mention the extra moves that are both unblockable and undodgeable. There is nothing fun about it. If you want to make bosses in a game like this then just give them more health and make the AI harder. Some of these problems would be easily fixed by simply giving extra option for hard and very hard mode for all towers and removing the whole element system and reworking how the bosses work.

Also towers of time or invasions doesn't have character intros which is straight up idiotic. What's the point of hiring voice actors if you never hear them?

So only proper singleplayer fun you can get is from the story mode and the classic towers which do not have any dump modifiers and you can set preferred difficulty. Sadly classic towers do not contribute to invasion season points so if you want skins you need grind invasion matches or towers of time.

Multiplayer can be lot of fun, but can also be toxic as hell. I had some problems with desyncing, but noticeably less than in MK11. I would like to see in the future that you could make custom matches/lobbies with modifiers which affects both or only one player. This way even unevenly skilled friends can play and both have fun.

Second major gripe is the customization that got massive downgrade from MK11 and Injustice2 which was one of my favorite aspects of those games. Getting  most skins in this game is not rewarding and it's plagued with greedy monetization. Overall the skins are mixed bag, but it mostly comes down to personal preference. Still overall more good than bad. Some of the redesigns I do not like and others are literally some of the best skins ever. Still I would have preferred to actually have some customization options instead of picking premade skins.

I really would've liked to give this game a positive review despite it's controversies, but the amount of idiotic features, designs and minigames infuriates me way too much. Still if you enjoy these types of games I would recommend to give it a try though only get it during sale and not full price.",False,1,16056

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,201555610,"Mortal Kombat 1 is a bold reboot of the iconic fighting franchise — delivering brutal combat, stunning visuals, and a fresh timeline twist that breathes new life into the MK universe.

The story mode is cinematic and engaging, with high production value and a creative reimagining of classic characters. Gameplay is smooth and responsive, and the addition of the Kameo system adds new layers of strategy to fights without overwhelming newcomers.

Visually, the game is absolutely gorgeous. From the detailed character models to the insanely over-the-top Fatalities, everything feels polished and intense. Online performance has improved since launch, though some matchmaking and netcode issues can still pop up occasionally.

The only major downside? The monetization. Premium skins and grind-heavy unlocks can make the experience feel a bit commercialized, especially for a full-priced title..",True,5,3502

- ПоТоМу, что разраБОТчики не сохраняют что - то лучшее в серии, а изобретают велосипед:
Перед боем нельзя выбирать костюм. В МК 11 оч неплохая кастомизация и куча шкурок, которые прямо в меню выбора персонажа можно сменить. И ВЕДЬ это касается всех настроек! Даже уход и приход на сцену битвы можно изменить и не на один. А тут чистый рандом или строгая привязка. У тебя может появится скин МК3 с маской из МК10.
- Потому что кроме режима Вторжение (который является десятком арен и модификаторами, где 1 сцена может просто задалбывать не один час) и кроме никчемных башен делать нечего. 
- Потому что плевали на российских геймеров.
- Мало костюмов, открывающих и закрывающих заставок, контента в принципе.
- Самой красивой ареной считается ТА, ГДЕ НИЧЕГО НЕТ! ПОЛЕ вашу мамашу!
- Потому что сюжетка (хоть и снята с неплохих ракурсов с режиссерской точки зрения) - ОЧЕНЬ слабая. Сюжет даж хуже МК 11, а это о многом говорит. И в МКХ она на обе ноги хромая - стабильность.
- Моих любимых персонажей (Милина, Таня, Сектор и Сайрекс) сделали лез*ухами или уродами.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,201255194,"For added context, I have played all the previous MKs for years now and even engaged in some tournaments AND have multiple hundred of hours on PS5

I feel very conflicted about this game. I REALLY dig the graphics and the stages (they are ABSOLUTE work of art). Fatalities are back to the core of quick, brutal and efficient contrasting with MK11's longer and more cinematic ones. A LOT of returning characters from older titles which will put a smile on veteran's faces and finally, a few of the GREATEST collab characters in MK history (CMON, Homelander and Omni-man? That shit slaps!)

However, things do fall off rather quickly when it comes to the rest. The pace is at a perfect middle ground within the slow and punishing MK12 and the break neck speed that was MKX. The new KAMEO system I think is pretty good, you can get very wacky with the combos. The problem of this games comes from Netherreal themselves, not the game.

The garbage balancing killed this game. I am not kidding when I say that in one PRO tournament, 98% of the competitors were all using the same character due to how broken it was (Peacemaker), I had never seen something so atrocious in years. The game is INSANELY poorly optimized and they didnt even bothered to compress it (over 118 GB for a fighter, are we serious?). 

The story start up decent and then offs itself near the middle to morph into the overused ""multiverse"" trope and completely fails to use it on top of it

All of this combined with the base price, the crazy amount of dlcs and the fact that they confirmed that support for this game will end up soon, I think its safe to say that I cannot recommend this game. Maybe get it during a HUGE sale but other than that, stick with MKX or MK11",False,59,1719
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,201253978,"SOOO its a Mortal Kombat game yeah we know already. But lemme say smth about it not just being fan, for goods and bads. 

So it has many better sides than old mortal kombat games such as MK11 and MKX. 

I aint talk about graphics its normal that its better than before cause it must be. And for they removed krypt thats bad but they added new mode named ""Invasion"" i think its kinda better to have fun in there. Finding new skins and ranked up ur character then it gives u plenty of gears skins etc. That sounds good. 

For story mode they added part 2 as DLC but it includes in Definitive Edition. Story mode is fun and also it has good story. 

For gameplay , in MK1 there is new combos that mostly in the air makes game more fun and kinda hard to make those combos but some practice will let u be undefeated. Thats good.

And they added KAMEO characters it reminded me MK9 knows as Kompleted Edition, u have second character to pick but its just helping u from side, and it helps u make longer combos and etc. And i liked how kameo's have their own brutalities fatalities. And not much hard to do them. 

And for bad sides ; 
TBH it doesnt have many bad sides but to be sure not everyone thinks the same, if u want more smoothy gameplay and air combos its best choice to have MK1. I just bought the game 1 day ago and already completed half day (12hrs) and i had so good fun and good time. Thats worthy. 

I got the Definitive Edition its including almost all kombat packes and DLCs , i think there was just 3-4 skin bundle DLCs that i didnt get but thats okay. 

I bought it with discount and it worth really.

I highly recommend it for players who likes fights like brutal way :D

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,201206640,"I am done with Mortal Kombat!

Let me explain...
I was a big fan of Mortal Kombat! Although not being able to have the full experience with the 3d games and those before 
NetherRealm Studios, I played a lot and respected the new ones as much as I could. After the release of MK11, things started to change. The story began to deteriorate, the devs decided to be scummy with their prices overall the new products and DLCs; too expensive and they rarely give us a worthy sale!

The quality of the new releases are also bad because the community has high expectations, but all they release are either fan services which its by overall straight up repetition all over with rarely anything new!

By short, when they decided to add timelines to this series, basically showed us the lack of actual potential of being creative and they kept giving us Marvel style garbage slope; although I must agree that the story was getting to an end and making a new one was probably smart, but poorly managed!
The story DLCs and the character DLCs are also not worth it of how bad and short they are!

Now by gameplay wise, the experience can be either stable or the game could be full of lag despite reducing its resolution and other settings.

You can agree if you want, this was only my own perspective through these years, but if you're really into MK still and you love the new games, I would highly recommend you to wait for a sale instead of buying it at a full price; if not then don't!

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,200794087,"Sempre curti jogos de luta  e, claro, acompanhando cada lançamento da franquia Mortal Kombat. Quando anunciaram o Mortal Kombat 1, pra ser sincero, não fiquei tão animado de cara. Parecia que iam só reciclar o que já tinham feito no anterior, mudando umas coisinhas aqui e ali. Tive aquela impressão de que ia ser só mais um reboot genérico. Mas olha... eu tava bem enganado.
Conforme foram saindo os trailers e novidades, minha visão foi mudando. Começaram a mostrar ideias novas, mecânicas interessantes e até personagens com habilidades mais criativas — tipo um que se transforma de forma animalesca, algo que sempre achei que faltava em jogos do gênero. A hype foi subindo.
E vou te falar: valeu muito a pena.
Zerei o modo história e fiquei preso do início ao fim. O combate ainda tem aquela essência clássica de MK, mas agora com várias melhorias que deixam tudo mais dinâmico. Adicionaram um sistema de combate novo chamado “parceiro” — personagens que entram durante a luta pra te ajudar com ataques extras, quebrar combos ou até abrir espaço pra você encaixar uma sequência. É uma adição que muda o ritmo das lutas e dá mais opções estratégicas pra quem curte dominar o sistema.
Outra coisa que me surpreendeu foi a história. Eles refizeram as origens de muitos personagens famosos, e o resultado ficou bem mais interessante do que eu esperava. Mesmo sendo uma campanha relativamente curta, ela consegue ser intensa, bem dirigida e com ótimos momentos. Vale muito a pena jogar, principalmente se você já acompanha a saga.
Visualmente o jogo é um absurdo. Os gráficos são de cair o queixo — os efeitos de luz, os detalhes nos personagens, os cenários... tudo muito bem feito. É o tipo de jogo que te prende também pelo visual, não só pela gameplay.
Sobre o preço: como todo jogo Triple-A lançado hoje em dia, tá bem salgado. Não acho justo os valores praticados aqui no Brasil, então, se puder, recomendo esperar uma promoção ou procurar uma chave em site confiável por um valor mais acessível.
Mas no fim das contas, se você é fã de jogos de luta, curte Mortal Kombat ou só quer uma experiência intensa e divertida, esse jogo entrega demais. Dá gosto de jogar.",True,0,2094

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,200101287,"this game is fun. One of the good MK game but there are still things that could've done better. This game better is than MKX in character model and graphics bur remaining things like story, combat etc... MKX wins!!
my rating for this game is 6/10.

POSITIVES:
1. starting with graphics, the graphics is done so well, all the character models and their clothing are detailed and designed well.
2. The world is so beautiful and vibrant.
3. Very good optimisation, as far as i played there's no glitch or bug but there are some mis-inputs.
4. Visual effects, the particle effects and the animations are improved a lot while comparing to the previous games also the arenas are well designed and vibrant.
5. The game has introduced interesting guest characters but i still miss Kratos. 
6. The cameos introduced it this game balances the characters, like if the main character doesnt have projectiles you can choose the cameo with projectiles for fight. 

NEUTRAL:
1. Story is good but  could've been better, players can easily predict what happens next and some twists can be easily guessed.
2. Brutalities are good but could've been improved as many look similar. Same goes for Fatalities too.
3. Combat is not as good as MKX. MKX had a really very good and snappy combat.

NEGATIVES:
1.  The blood look like paint, also the bone breaking are not that much snappy as it was in MKX.
2. The game introduced Cameo system, i feel its dumb. Previous games had interactive objects during fight which made the fight more interesting but this game ruined it. Timing and planning the attacks based on the environment was more interesting.
3. The arenas look beautiful and vibrant but whats the point? As i mentioned that earlier games had interactive objects unique for each arena made the every arena unique and interesting but here every arena feels the same.
4. I feel the crypt is much more interesting than this invasion mode introduced in this game, initially the invasion more felt interesting but its grinding, after a few minutes of playing invasion mode, it feels so annoying.
5. Customisation is so nice but only if you, i hate the palette system too, also players cannot change the customisation in the selection menu, players should change the armours and clothes only in customisation.
6. Online is WORST.",True,0,3593

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,199745772,"I was really hyped for this game and bought it as pre-order. But from the first week of release its all gone. Story was bad, I mean really bad. They did not bother anything to explain why? For example how did Kuai-Liang got his scorpion powers? Why  there is a Tournament at all if neither of realms attacked each other? There is so many B.S events in this ""Liu-Kang Era"". 

Then the gameplay. This game is not for a casual player. If you play this game, you have to master both main and the cameo characters. In the old MK games if you want to play Mileena just practise Mileena combos. In this game if you want to play Mileena you need to practise both Mileena and Cameo characters. For example, to get max damage Mileena+scorpion, for defence Mileena+ Sub zero, for zone control Mileena+Kano etc. Now multiply this all main characters and all cameo characters. And you have to be precise (For some interactions milisecond precise) on timing with cameo characters otherwise you will drop your combo. So if you are a casual player you'll end up playing just 1-2 characters most of the time. 

When the game first released, some characters like kenshi, raiden+Cyrax duo, johnny cage was really broken. They fixed some of it but still some characters very weak against others. This is really annoying. For example Johnny Cage doesn't need a guest character at all. His skill kit let him extend the combos on his own with a high damage, lets him make pressure with + on block moves and bunch of 50/50's . So good luck in multiplayer mode.

And the single player mode. AKA ""invasions"". You need to do same matches over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. To get what? a couple skins and items. (BTW They are not actual skins, just same skin with different colours and mostly they are terrible and items are barely noticible in game) Isn't here any good skins? Yes there is. But you have to pay at least five bucks. Anyting looking good is behind a paywall in this game. 

This game made for selling DLC's. DLC caharactes like quan-chi and ermac. They aren't supposed to DLC characters. They are in the main story. And this year Netherrealm put the last nail on the coffin. Chaos Reigns Expansion. A DLC with a same price tag of a main game. What a brilliant idea. Is it worth? Absolutely not. The Story was even worse. Characters acting like bad guys in cartoons. No motive, no meaning. ""We are bad guys just because"". Even Kronika has a motive. And also DLC characters mostly terrible. They should add at least another 20 characters to put a price tag of 50 bucks.

Long story short Netherrealm studios and WB messed up this game big time with their greed. The game looks very good from the beginnig.  Its fun for a couple hours. Then nothing more. If you  play at least 2-3 hours daily you can have fun some time later in multiplayer mode. Otherwise game is shallow.",False,86,10499

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,199651784,"I did play Sub Zero mythologies but that was like Battlefield Hardline in a way, just a spin off. Not an ""official"" numbered release by them. I played some of the stuff through the years but mostly started playing it again with 9 up till now.

But just like the original Battlefield 1942 which started in 2003 btw, I was there when this franchise began back in the 90s.

Players were immediately wowed at the digitized graphics.

After its initial release, a bit after, came Mortal Kombat 2. The game had been streamlined....optimized.

The controls smoother, the power moves more strategic and effective. This transition was like Windows Vista VS Windows 7................Battlefield 3 VS Battlefield 4................you get the idea.

Then came MK 3. This one added the ""run"" ability. And there were players that could just ware you out with it and the combos too. Imho I did not like it, I thought it was a wrong direction for the game at the time. Maybe I was just subliminally thinking along the lines of the whole ""zombies that run"" argument years before it was ever a thing .

I point this out because of the similarity to the current cameo system in the modern MK. It was probably a tough choice the developers made to add that. A feature that really changed the foundation of the core game.

Kind of like side stepping in MK4 and a few on. Mortal 4 was the first outing as a completely 3d MK, completely composed of 3d graphics. I guess that made it a mile stone in ways.

ALL the fighting games that are still being made today seem to be like that. Completely composed of 3d assets. But why do that if the end result is just a 2d canvas? lol

I got back into it with 9. It was a much more streamlined 3d then 4 was. I got 10 and 11 on sale here @ Steam. Something about 11 really reminded me of 2. I thought it was polished, balanced, etc etc. To me that is the best 3d MK they have made.

MK 12 or ONE as they called it in their name revision reboot thing. I did actually like the story a lot. Carrying over from 11, Liu Kang essentially became Raiden and did what Raiden did. And Raiden gave his powers to Liu Kang and he starts the universe over. Now Raiden is essentially Liu Kang in a bit of a time paradox. As a bible believer in the modern day I do believe that Jesus Christ has the power to do such a thing with someone. After all he said in his father's house were ""many mansions"". What is a mansion? A really big house, many rooms. I guess you could think of that as cities, states, nations, worlds, realities, depending on the size and scope of your imagination.

I thought the controls and graphics were decent, but I still look to 11 as being the 3d peak at this point. As said before I did not like the cameo system but I thought it was really well done, likely a nightmare to program.",True,0,892

Jo jeet ta tha, use dusre dost nasta khilate the – aur main mostly jeetta tha 😎. Is game se mujhe bachpan me confidence aur khushiya dono mile hain.

Ab jab MK1 aaya, to mann me ek hi thought tha – “Kya ye purani yaadon ko wapas laa payega?”
Aur jawab hai – Haan, 100% laaya!

💥 Storyline – Honestly, ye MK series ki best storylines me se ek lagi. Liu Kang ke naye era ka concept fresh hai, aur har character ka background solid feel hota hai. Cutscenes movie jaise lagte hain – emotional bhi aur badass bhi.

🎮 Gameplay – Fighting mechanics smooth hai, aur Kameo system naye combos aur creativity ke liye perfect hai. Har match me ek alag excitement hoti hai.

🕹️ Graphics & Sound – Visually stunning hai! Fatalities dekh ke lagta hai, “Bhai, ye to next level hai!” Aur sound design to itna crisp hai ki har punch ka asar feel hota hai.

❤️ Nostalgia + Modern Touch – Ye game ne mera bachpan ka passion wapas jaga diya. MK1 sirf ek game nahi, ek feeling hai.

⸻

Verdict: Agar aap bhi Mortal Kombat ke purane fan ho, to ye game aapke liye ek emotional ride hai. Aur naye players ke liye – ye perfect entry point hai MK universe me.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,199388329,"MK12 (AKA MK1) does a lot of things right, and a lot of things wrong.

Let's start with the cons:
1. An MTX nightmare. For those of us that have been battling against MTX business practices, this game has all the trappings of a problem. I am not just talking about DLC purchases for story and character unlocks. They have an in game currency bought with real world money that is used to do nothing but buy skins for characters. There is also a semi-lootbox situation (the shrine) but that doesn't seem to be based on real world money
2. Story: I absolutely loath multiverse and time travel. Every IP is doing it. Every IP is failing from including it. It lacks an original idea, just ""let me copy your home work""
3. Kameos are just meh. There are two few of them, and honestly? I don't like that the kameos are locked to the small number of kameo characters
4. Lacking in characters: For both story and multiplayer roster I feel like the exclusion of characters is painful. No Sonya Blade and Jax? Really? Fine, no Jax, but you're essentially rebooting the story and include all the usual suspects from MK1 (1992) EXCEPT Sonya? Fail. Scorpion is no longer Hanzo? Fail.

The pros:
1. Gameplay is great. The combos flow nicely, invasions is a nice touch IMO. Lots of modes to play around with. Online, couch, and cpu versus, tournament rules, various tower kombat. It has all I expect at the bare minimum plus some new stuff
2. Graphics are absolutely gorgeous
3. Steam Deck functionality. It works just fine on the deck
4. Character customisation: now while I hate MTX for skins, I do like when the game gives you skins for progression in various modes and story, which MK1 also does. It's fun when they let me customise the character
5. Story: While I have issues with the time travel and multiverse nonsense (as stated above) SOME changes to the timeline are absolutely fun for me. As a Reptile main, I love the implications of him and Ashrah, and I love that he's not a bad guy anymore

Not a fan of Kameos you say, well i don't dislike them anymore in all fairness. 
However, to me personally speaking, those Kameos should also have been included as unlockables instead of paid for.
I believe most people would have welcomed the grind somewhat similar to The Krypt or whatnot.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,199335572,"Overall, I would rekommend this game.
To everyone on the fence, who played the previous games, I will list the differences here. Mainly between this game and MK11.
1) THEY REMOVED FRENDSHIPS!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
To me, personally, this was the worst news that I learned the hard way, by buying and playing. The mere idea of having Friendships in MK11 was a bit wholesome. Now they're gone. But in return, Animalities have made a komeback.
2a) To unlock finishing movies, instead of finding them at random in the Krypt, you get them by winning fights as the fighter and Kameo, as there is a ranking system for each fighter and each kameo, separately. To me, this is the best news that I learned the hard way by playing the game. Which brings me to my next point:
2b) The fighter that you choose and the Kameo that you choose each have their own separate fatalities and brutalities, and you kan use either one to finish off an opponent. BTW, you still get more points by doing brutalities in Towers, so never do fatalities, always try to do brutalities. Which brings me to my next point:
2c) They also got rid of Mercy. So if you f*** up a brutality, you don't get another chance, you have to use a fatality or an animality.
3) To me, so far, the fatalities and and animalities are a lot more forgiving when it komes to how far you are way from your opponent to perform them.
4a) Was Scorpion your favorite fighter in the previous game? TOO BAD! He's now only a kameo kharacter.
4b) Quan Chi is, I believe, both a fighter and a Kameo? Idk how they explain that lore-wise.
4c) Also Motaro has come back, but only as a Kameo.
5) They've gone back to where you use the block button as the special move enhancer. I think MK11 totally missed the mark on this, having you use the stupid interact button to enhance special moves. Pfft.
6) Match-up intros are slightly less cool than MK11's, but they're still nice. For some reason, the intro inkludes one of the kharacters hitting the other and knocking them over. It doesn't subtrakt from your health in the fight, but it still seems a tiny bit demoralizing. 
Potato) Peacemaker, Homelander, and Ghost Face (from the movie series ""Scream"") are funny.
7) Runs better than MK11, but its file size has more heft to it. 
8) Nitara is back. Step on me pls mommy
9) Madam Bo, too. Would.",True,0,9343

Online is pretty much empty — barely anyone’s playing. There are more people active in Guilty Gear XX Acent Core Plus R from 2012.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,199285599,"It’s a shame. I have been a fan of the franchise for a long time. While it seems like they’ve made some improvements over the years Im many respects, it seems like they’ve taken some steps back. 

The gameplay itself is decent, and although Im not a huge fan of the kameo mechanic, it provides a lot of diversity to the games (even though most online games feature the same non-diverse characters). The net code is also awesome, game feels great and actually playable at pings like 180. 

Solo content is abysmal. The towers feel repetitive and just stupid in a lot of respects. I don’t want to get bullied through silly armour attacks, I want to be beaten by respectable computer brains and modifiers. And the invasions single player mode is very 1 dimensional. Big step back from mk 11’s towers and krypt mode. 

Fan favourite characters being hidden behind a paywall is also a cheeky marketing strategy. Im all for paying extra money for ghostface or omniman, but paying for beloved characters like quan chi or havik (should have been in the game to begin with) don’t feel great. Not only that, but a lot of dlc characters and kameos are front runners in the meta. 

All in all, even on special, the game didn’t feel great to buy. It’s a good game in a lot of respects, but it’s sad to see a once beloved franchise falling victim to corporate marketing nonsense. Besides that, it seems like so much is invested into making the game look good, and while the game does look absolutely beautiful, it isn’t particularly the selling point for mortal kombat games. It feels like we need a game with an arcade feel to it like mkx. Realism is great and all, but it’s okay for a game to feel like a game still. Customisation options like mk11 was awesome.

I think casual & single-players will have a lot of fun and frustration with it, especially focusing on Invasions and towers of time but that's really all it has to offer. 

Story mode is a long cutscene with a sloppy plot trying to retcon everything that's been done without really moving forward to something new. What IS new is the Kameo system, which tends to lock your characters to certain kameos so you can actually use your moveset in a combo, and that really only comes from trial and error. Speaking of kameos, I get the big feeling they were severely rushed as a later idea.. they have minimal cosmetics, no gear, close to no presence on-screen, and an incredibly limited moveset. Some of these kameos were even characters requested as full characters. As for full characters? We got nickel and dimed for every single one, they release with minimal cosmetics, refuse to do anything additional with those characters, and cosmetics people want? they will charge you real money for (MK2/3, deception, deadly alliance, conan skins for example).

My biggest gripe with the game and the company as a whole: greed. I'm sorry, but having to monetize skins in a fighting game with extreme prices just pisses me off a lot. Not just that, content and character customizations got reduced to a small fraction in MK1, and really just disappointed me a lot. There are also skins that I actually want, but they are time gated and made obtaining them virtually impossible. Not just that, their ""Palettes"" dont really make sense as I don't know what they're trying to achieve with their color combinations, something from MK11 where they missed the point of certain characters with a set tone. As a result, I didn't bother to finish their story mode or even try to do their tutorials, just stopped playing it altogether.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,198757196,"[h3]How the hell can you make a game that has the best gameplay in the series, the best graphics, the best presentation and art direction, but still completely mess up the most basic stuff?[/h3]

The offline content is bafflingly stupid. Like, I wouldn’t have that much of a problem with Towers of Time and Invasions if I could simply play them normally. What do I mean by that? Well, each match in these game modes has a “level” and “attributes,” so the CPU might have more health than you, or you might deal more damage of a certain element—concepts that have no place in a fighting game.

If you have even half a brain, these matches end in a single combo, since they don’t have intros and are only one round long. That’s not fun. You spend 20 seconds clicking “OK → NEXT → NEXT” (the rewards for these matches are so dull and boring that they’re not even worth paying attention to), and then you go to the next match, spend 15 seconds “fighting,” rinse and repeat.

So for every, let’s say, minute you spend playing this offline “content,” at least 50% of that time is spent loading and clicking through menus.

Why? Why the hell did they design it this way? The gameplay is fun, but the game actively stops you from playing it.

Also, why would you spend so much money hiring famous actors (Yuri Lowenthal, Van Damme, Megan Fox, J.K. Simmons, John Cena, etc.) to voice characters, [i]only for the game to skip the intros in pretty much every single mode besides the Classic Towers and VS mode?[/i] And I’m not even getting into the seasonal content, battle passes, weekly and daily missions, the way they dropped support in just two years, and how ridiculously dumb the story is.

Half of these issues could be solved by simply adding an option to toggle intros ON/OFF and set how many rounds you want to play in Towers and Invasions—but NetherRealm couldn’t even do that.

MK1 is a great game, riddled with horrendous, excruciatingly dumb decisions that ruined its longevity from day one. I’ve been an MK fan since MK9, but MK1 made me drop the franchise and switch to Street Fighter instead.",False,13,1281

the only con i have is sonya blade, jax briggs, and kano, etc are all kamos, so they arent technically playable characters in the base game which is a little sad because they are huge characters in the MK Story.

It felt like the developers hated the fan base with some of their ""balance"" decisions. I thought it would have gotten better after updates and since the releases of the new fighters. I got the definitive edition on PC. Advantage is that all my progression crossed over after i linked my account on WB games which was a win. I like the additional fighters.

I don’t play it, I don’t care about ranked ladders, and I have zero interest in hackers, netcode, or any of that. What you’ll find here is a review focused solely on the core experience of Mortal Kombat 1 from the perspective of a long-time fan—someone who grew up with the franchise and still gets hyped for a good story, memorable characters, and throwing hands in style.

And damn, does this game deliver.

[h2]Story & Presentation[/h2]
The story mode is a fantastic reboot—a much-needed timeline reset that gives fresh outcomes to familiar characters. Whether you're a veteran or a newcomer, there's a real sense of purpose and direction here, and it all comes wrapped in top-tier visuals, cinematic-quality animations, and epic sound work that makes every moment hit harder.

The new narrative approach reimagines the klassics in a way that feels respectful and exciting, with enough twists to keep you locked in from start to finish. I played the entire main story (non-DLC) on Very Hard difficulty in about 10 hours, and I was hooked the whole way through. No crashes, no lost save files, no bugs—just raw MK goodness.

[h2]Gameplay & Mechanics[/h2]
MK1 plays like a love letter to the franchise while still pushing things forward. The mechanics are smooth and impactful, with a greater emphasis on kombos and flow than raw special move spam—though both are still very much present. Combat feels balanced and satisfying, and the Kameo system adds an extra layer of strategy without overwhelming the player.

It’s accessible enough for newcomers but deep enough for veterans who want to master every move and maximize every fight. Even on harder difficulties, the AI is challenging but fair—encouraging you to actually learn your character instead of just button-mashing.

[h2]Visuals & Art Direction[/h2]
Visually, this game is stunning. The environments are dripping with atmosphere—especially Outworld, which looks better than it ever has. Character designs strike a perfect balance between classic and modern, with fantastic reinterpretations that still feel true to their roots.

The animations are easily among the best I’ve seen in 30 years of gaming. Every punch, kick, and fatality has real weight behind it, and it all contributes to making the MK universe feel more alive—and more brutal—than ever.

[h2]A Few Gripes (But Nothing Fatal)[/h2]
Is it perfect? No game is. Some iconic characters are locked behind DLC or only appear as Kameo fighters, and I get why that might turn some fans off. The focus on combos over special moves may also not be everyone’s cup of tea. And yes, splitting the story into two parts (with the second behind a paywall) is controversial.

But personally? None of that ruined the experience for me. I don’t care about unlocking every character. I don’t care about online rankings. I care about a solid Mortal Kombat experience—and in that regard, MK1 absolutely delivers.

Also worth noting: despite widespread performance complaints, I encountered zero issues on my rig (RTX 4070 Ti Super, Ryzen 5 3600X, 32GB RAM). Everything ran buttery smooth from start to finish, even under ultra high settings, 1440p and no DLSS.

[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
If you’re a long-time fan from the golden arcade era—or even someone curious about what modern MK has to offer—this is easily one of the best (if not THE best) entries in the franchise. Just get the definitive edition if you’re bothered by DLC content, and you’ll have a complete, satisfying experience from start to finish.

Mortal Kombat 1 is a bloody good time, full of stylish combat, memorable moments, and unapologetic fun. It’s everything you remember loving about MK, dialed up to 11, and wrapped in the best visuals the series has ever seen.

The Kameo mechanic could be interesting if it were implemented in a way that added value, which is not the case, simply because it completely unbalances the main roster of the game.

The game has very little base content and manages to be worse in every aspect when compared to its predecessor. The problem with this game was the high expectations surrounding it. An example of this is the Krypt, which was simply cut in favor of a test with the new Invasions mode.

It’s a good game, and I won’t deny that I’ve had fun with it, but I also can’t ignore the mistakes surrounding it.

The main downside is the poor optimization, probably due to the Denuvo Anti-Tamper system. I feel somewhat underwhelmed that the developers moved on to other projects so quickly, leaving this game behind. It also has one of the smallest rosters in the series, which was disappointing.

That said, I really like how they continue adding guest characters like Homelander, Omni-Man, and Peacemaker — that's a great touch. I'm still hoping the game gets better optimized in the future, ideally prioritizing GPU over CPU performance.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,197357618,"[h1]A Vivid Orgy of Violence, Banned in Three Major Countries[/h1]
It's a damn shame that the aggressive tactics of [i]Mortal Kombat 1[/i]’s publisher, Warner Bros Games, managed to steal the thunder of who should truly be held up high for this release. I am of course talking about the developer, NetherRealm Studios, and their army of imaginative artists, writers, designers, producers, voice and motion actors, programmers, audio engineers, QA testers and admin people who [i]made[/i] this thing and [i]not[/i] the people merely charged with wringing profit from it. 

Because WB Games’s greedy shenanigans—extensive microtransactions, expensive expansion—have not only wrongly and destructively eclipsed the utterly [i]astounding[/i] presentation of this and what Unreal Engine 4 looks like in the hands of true talent but also cost us any future content less than two years after release by essentially putting a sour taste in fans' mouths that they won’t soon forget. Truly, I haven’t seen so much acrimony surrounding a [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] game than I have here. 

The drama has since passed and it’s now safe to assume [i]Mortal Kombat 1[/i] (2023) is effectively concluded, with the [i]Definitive Edition[/i] wrapping it all up in a single neat package. What remains, the imagination and creativity on display, should still not be missed by anyone with eyes and a stomach for digital violence. I implore you to get this, on sale or not, as this remains a great value for the dozens of hours of splendorous visuals and fun gameplay you get for the cost of what seems to be a single night of delivery from UberEats these days. 

There really is so much to talk about with this title, more good than bad, but seeing I don’t get paid to write reviews, brevity be damned. I am only covering the single-player experience because I don’t play multiplayer games anymore. I am mostly interested in this game’s merits artistically and gameplay-wise as it’s what I feel I’m most qualified to speak to, so if you don’t care to read such anecdotal takes, stop here.

[h2]Visuals[/h2]
Even being a long-time fan, I jumped at buying this due to its remarkably colorful presentation. Coming off the darker, dustier art direction of the excellent [i]Mortal Kombat 11[/i] (2019), [i]Mortal Kombat 1[/i] clearly dials up the saturation visually in a welcome change of scenery that is in line with the story’s reboot. Cleverly, I believe this was also done to capitalize on the latest display technology and the vibrant hues now possible on all of our newer TVs and monitors. Classic costumes return in surprisingly bright primary colors, and they work incredibly well alongside vivid projectiles. You’ll see what I mean on the first whizzing fireworks from Li Mei’s fists, the pretty particle effects, or Liu Kang’s blazing forearms and glowing eyes emerging from the darkness along with every other spectacular sparkle obviously designed to take advantage of HDR displays. Owners of 4K OLEDs with deep blacks will be rewarded doubly. If you can, witness this up close on a 48” display or larger. 

(Speaking of hardware, let me take a second to emphasize that to play any [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] game without a fight stick or a lever-less controller totally misses the experience. You need to be quick with your commands to execute and get better and it quickly becomes apparent thumbs are not best for this (but you suit yourself).) 

[h2]Story[/h2]
I found [i]Mortal Kombat 1[/i]’s story mode to be a slow burn compared to the last game but it does pick up toward the end with a killer climax. It is mighty cool the Deadly Alliance is back in this and we can see their insanity in high resolutions. The character artists sure made Quan-chi look like a creepy crazed conjurer, and the young Shang Tsung is the smarmiest, most punchable face in gaming [i]ever[/i], making it a real treat to pummel to your heart’s content. 

After this and the last game's story mode, NetherRealm’s standards are sky high, to the point a live-action feature film is actually a disservice to the franchise, a downgrade in entertainment since a flick is never interactive like this is, nor will it ever be as fully developed, bloody or gory. The expansion, [i]Khaos Reigns[/i], extends on this, and I enjoyed Havik’s villainous sadism as well as the additional world building on display. The fighting in all this is on par with any kung-fu exploitation films from the 1970s, with seemingly every scene’s tension building and broiling over into an epic brawl. This is a game that never forgets it’s a fighting game, and consistently delivers no holds barred throwdowns that make UFC fights look like child’s play.

[h2]Delights[/h2]
NetherRealm rewards loyal fans, so it’s an indulgence how many Midway-era 3D characters return, like Mavado, Nitara, Ashrah, Darrius, Sareena, etc. I love that our Elder God Ed Boon and company seemingly leaves no character of this franchise behind. Test Your Might is back, which is certainly nostalgic. Animalities make an encore, and boy are they something, brutalities, too. Fatalities? Still as creative and sickening as ever, especially the classics from [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] (1992).

[h2]Disappointments[/h2]
No stage fatalities. No krypt. No cleavage or big swaying tiddies (I am particularly disappointed Sonya’s thong from her ‘92 costume was altered to a full-coverage brief). I have a theory that the concealing nature of the getups coincides with Liu Kang's benevolent (read: feminist?) timeline. Apparently, his is to be a respectful male gaze-free zone, not even a gentleman boner to be had, except if you're looking to bathe in the majesty of 1980s Arnold Schwarzeneggar as Conan the Barbarian—he seems to be the most naked one in the roster beside centaur Motaro, or Johnny Cage’s (awesome) Jean-Claude Van Damm skin from [i]Bloodsport[/i] (1988) (A missed opportunity I now realize is we should have gotten an opposing Bolo Yeung (aka ""Chinese Hercules"") but as a skin for Liu Kang!). Seeing depravity is seeping from every other digital orifice nowadays, I’m inclined to give NetherRealm a pass on this and I can always throw in [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] (2011). 

Now Kameo characters—your teammate who pops in at your command to aid in battles—could fall under disappointments in case you were like me and wanted to see Mavado or any of the others fleshed out as fully playable characters. Still, I liked the experiment of this tag-team approach as it’s novel and different.

Invasions mode is…fair. It provides contrast to climbing endless towers, being seasonal with maps of mesas that you run around in connected by portals, fighting wonky hybrid characters (Quan-chi’s head on Frost’s body with Li Mei’s moves was a trip) and wacky modifiers (I loved Toasty with the toasters shooting rocket bread, and Kashoo, a random, chainsaw-wielding evil squirrel that causes chaos during matches) to unlock that season’s cosmetics while you master your main and kameo characters. The whole talisman-relic-consumables-forge-shop aspect of Invasions mode I found uninteresting and even almost meaningless as I was able to win most fights without paying direct attention to what I was doing with them. 

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
As a [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] game, this is not the most we’ve gotten for our money, however, it is the best Mortal Kombat has ever looked upon a bedrock of solid gameplay, and I’ll buy that for a dollar. There were some mistakes made but I’m sympathetic because I’m a fanboy, and [i]Mortal Kombat[/i] is something that’s always been there almost my whole life now, like [i]DOOM[/i]. There is so much gameplay here with a big roster and a hugely high skill ceiling that I think this release will still be being played the day [i]Mortal Kombat 2[/i] rolls around. For now, I am excited to hear [i]Injustice 3[/i] is likely NetherRealm’s next project and hopefully WB Games learns from its strategies and this timeline will right itself.",True,3,2461

While I enjoyed the game at the most there are certain issues that it has. Most importantly the amount of micro transactions and additional content that is being gate kept from you because you haven't bought extra packages is insane to me. 

£6.50 for a playable character 
£4 for a cameo character that doesn't do all that much is ridiculous.
£40 Khaos Reigns DLC which is almost the full price of the base game.

The story is pretty decent and funny at times with brilliant voice overs. As always with other Mortal Kombat / Injustice games there are characters that are just better or easier to use than others which might be a concern to some people. The cameo system is not that good, rather great for the devs though as it gives them more sources of income. A rather fast game for completionists as most achievements are rather straight forward and moderate in difficulty. All things aside I did enjoy my experience with Mortal Kombat 1. If you are considering getting a taste of all the Mortal Kombat 1 content I would suggest getting it on sale. 

Prices on sale: Base game = £15 and Definitive Edition = £22

Game overall is okay, controls are very simple for a MK game which is a plus for some and a negative for some, I liked it. However, it just becomes so repetitive fast.

The game has bugs:
1. the keyboard blocks and you can never get a chance to hit back again (i don't mean the rules of the game)
2. custom keys  mapping is reverted for 1s or 2s at the beginning of the round
3. the game has no purpose if you perform ""COMBOS""
4. bad game design also allows repeated moves forever just to ""win""
5. no run function, no throw with objects or weapons 
6. 3060 Ti 8GB should be enough even for ""ultra"" but with steam in the backgroud you get lag sometimes lag so you have to put steam on low in task manager
7. the players are few in number 1200 at most, you won't find someone to play with .. and even if you do .. they play as if their life is in that game :) .. 
8. if you only have PC keyboard combos are quite hard to do: my advise don't waste your money ...
9. I think MK 1 is done .. there are some bad decisions as to how and what and when the player can do starting with combos that are about nothing else then the opponent being able to ... play .. alone .. :)  why ..

It's the sad reality of gaming now... but why would you make a system where you can't play half the roster?!? They have a system in place that has the characters appear when you use a special, which means they made the sprites for the characters. Yet you can't play as them or those version of them. What a waste! 
This is it, the last Mortal Kombat game I'll buy. I'll just watch gameplay for the storyline if I get curious. I even got the DLC thinking I'll get a wide variety of characters to go through. There's TWENTY ONE Kameo fighters aka characters/skins you can't play as... the base game has 22 playable characters. Even moreso, you FIGHT AGAINST multiple Kameo fighters, which means they have entire move sets. You can purchase 13 DLC characters at the time of this review. None of them are the Kameo fighters (Cyrax and Sektor are not the same as the Kameo ones). Go back to better games like Ultimate MK Trilogy to get a decent roster. Even Deception wasn't disappointing like this even though the roster was only 26 characters. I wasn't even that upset with MK11 tbh... I guess the gameplay was enough to carry it.
I really think the biggest disappointment is seeing characters you've missed, then you can't even use them! Way to tease us with Stryker. I'm also guessing Nightwolf didn't sell well since he doesn't exist when he was in the last game as DLC. 
I'm done rambling... if you want a storyline like the MK11 campaign and nothing else, including no Krypt, go ahead and disappoint yourself with this cash grab.",False,3,448

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,195529344,"Writing this review since recently they announced Mortal Kombat 1 [url=https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810] no longer getting content updates [/url] and will only be about balancing and fixing bugs. I'll be focusing on mostly offline but there will be mentions of online.

Mortal Kombat 1 despite being enjoyable and fun experience lacks of replayability and worse amount of features than previous game. I'll be going from story first.

[h3] Story: [/h3]
In NRS games, Mortal Kombat had arlight story at best, really bad at worst (looking at you MK 11). Fortunatly MK 1 in my opinion was strongest they have written. I really do like characters that the new era and was enganged on what was happening. I even liked text feature when you lose a fight in a story! I think it was nice small addition to it!

Although MK 1 has strong story writing it unfortently falls down when you reaching end of Act 3. It uses multiverse where the fight against Shang Tsung and Liu Kang in previous game was so strong that it caused to have many universes on 'What If'. Personally after Act 3, i was not fan of where it was going but at least the final chapter of MK 1 was a nice touch of ability to play any character you liked.

Unfortently Khaos Reign expansion story was really terrible. It didn't really added much other than making main villain of Khaos Reign story a wasted potential and nothing burger. I would so far to say that it could be one of the weakest they have written so far.

I mostly liked characters in the game but i find their design to be just plain fine. I didn't liked them, didn't hate them. Some notable things are Reptile which in my opinion has the best design they ever had so far. I love idea that he can shapeshift into human and his own form, and Megan Fox infamous acting skills as Nitara.

[h3] Gameplay: [/h3]
The gameplay for Mortal Kombat 1 is in my opinion big improvement over MK 11. The meters are back! Allowing you to do extend combos with at least 3 bars at max. Breakers also make a return but instead uses 3 bars to break rather than 2 and requiring you to have Kameo avalaible. Fatal Blows also return. Now instead of activating attack immiediently it will activate animation prep-up and succesfully landing it will make Kameo then Main Fighter attack with x-ray pop up to show damage they've done. Imo it's much bigger improvement as previous one gave at time frustrating moments.

Kameos are new unique feature in MK 1. They are fun addition to the game despite not making it to main roster but giving them a chance to appear. They have their own movesets that can help your main fighter, brutalities and fatalities. While i do think they are fun, i doubt that people will want them back in the next installment.

Fatalities, Brutalities make an obvious return to the series and they did a pretty good joob on it. Khaos Reign introduced Animality (For free) which is also a nice way to finish your opponents with it.

[h3] Offline Modes: [/h3]
If you reached this review, i had mostly positive things to say. However after this, there will be many criticism pointed out to the modes, replayability and some of nitpicks and tactics that they have used that is alarming.

Firstly ""offline"" mode. Unfortently this game still suffers of requiring an internet connection. Meaning if you attempt to play offline without internet. You will get less amount of it.

Invansion was at launch that contained an leveling system and advancing through until you meet a certain character boss themed and defeat them. As much promises it shows, it does nothing much. Invasion gets repetitve quite fast as when you'll be advancing you through more in easy opponents due to AI just not being smart. I didn't find myself finishing some seasons due to skins of characters that i was not interested in playing. There is also a chance to get Ambush, which in my opinion is a waste of time and just there to annoy you more. Invasions also had a towers on there but there wasn't much to do in there since modifiers wasn't that much entertaining.

Tower of Time was reintroduced back in Khaos Reigns, while welcoming addition, it has gotten a downgrade as there is 9 towers total (12 when there is certain events happening like new character release). It still suffers the same issue as the towers are not replayable enough. Challenges were added tower of time to give a point boost and reward (including free premium currency) which is pretty good. The points are now relied on to be on top x%. Which is fine.

Towers are there also, giving you three length towers, two survival modes. As far as i know this is the only mode that you can play without worrying about internet connection (Story Mode should be also fine).

[h3] Online Mode: [/h3]
Online Mode is there. However like the offline it got downgrades but some upgrades. You are no longer able to join or see the rooms which is really shame as i think it was a fun feature. It only contains now Kasual, Ranked and King of The Hill. Ranked uses the same as MK 11, where you reach a certain rank to get rewards and after season ends, everyone goes back to first rank. There is an upgrade though it as you no longer allowed to decide what character you want to choose, locking in with a character + kameo and losing a match only allows you to change Kameos. Previously it required you to play FT3 matches rather than FT2 matches but that changed back FT2 which is better. You can instantly gain rewards upon reaching a rank which is a nice upgrade. Kasaul and KotH is not much to say about it.

[h3] Other, Nitpicks and Scummy Tactics: [/h3]

Essentialy this is the final category that i've decided to make it whole to one.

First things first, the release and Kombat Pack. I find it unacceptable the fact that Pre-Order Character and Kombat Pack contains characters that are in story mode. It screams to me that the game was unfinished and decided to roll out as a buyable dlc character. You can even play as Shang Tsung in the story mode but he is locked as DLC Pre-order Character.

There is no custom slot that allows you to choose what character skin and gear would you want to have. I find it unfortunate that despite the time of it, we'll never get that feature and will have to rely on favorites.

Monetization on the game is bad imo. The skins that you receive for free are lacking and most of them are recolors of the skin. At previous time, the prices for premium skins were bad to the point they had to tone it down. Even they made paid fatalities that got backlash to the point they had to compensate players who bought them with entire bundle of it.

The customazation is arlight, i do feel there is some upgrades and downgrades to it. I do feel there is less ability to customize your character unlike MK 11 but the skins are really nice despite of that. You can also do end of the round animations of your choosing, which is also nice.

Personal nit-pick but i am getting tired of Kombat Pack having 50% of guest characters. While i do find some guests welcoming (Ghostface, T-1000, Omni-Man, Homelander) it just decreases chance of original characters making return which is really shame because it would be sick if we got Tremor or Skarlet as main fighter.

[h3] Final Words: [/h3]

Thank you if you read this review through the end of it! Personally i enjoyed Mortal Kombat 1 with amount of hours i have but unfortently with scummy tactics, less replayability and end of the content updates, i find it not reccomending this game with the full price is asking for (especially with Defenitive Edition).

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,195451993,"“It’s in our blood.” That tagline couldn’t be more accurate. Mortal Kombat 1, the latest entry in NetherRealm Studios’ long-running fighting game franchise, isn’t just another sequel—it’s a complete timeline reboot. Again. But this time, it feels deliberate, cohesive, and refreshingly bold.

Liu Kang is now a Fire God with the powers of creation, and he’s reshaped the universe into a more peaceful reality—or so he thought. What follows is a vicious, dimension-shattering tournament with familiar faces, unfamiliar alliances, and the same satisfying thwack of a perfectly landed uppercut.

Combat in Mortal Kombat 1 is fast, fluid, and gloriously gory. The core gameplay feels tighter than ever, retaining the bone-crunching satisfaction of previous entries while introducing the Kameo Fighter system—a bold new tag-in mechanic that allows you to summon legacy characters mid-fight to extend combos, interrupt enemies, or save your skin.

It’s not just a gimmick. Kameo Fighters add real tactical depth. Choosing the right partner complements your main fighter and opens new combo trees and pressure tactics. It rewards experimentation without overwhelming newer players.

Returning fighters like Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Kitana feel reimagined with deeper lore and rebalanced abilities. Every punch lands with purpose, and the Fatal Blows and Fatalities are as gruesomely creative as ever—if not even more grotesque in their detail.

Mortal Kombat’s cinematic story modes have always been guilty pleasures, but MK1 raises the bar. The narrative blends surprisingly heartfelt character arcs with absurd twists and multiversal chaos.

Liu Kang’s attempt at peace unravels as alliances fracture, and alternate versions of classic characters emerge. The script is campy but clever, and the new dynamics—like Mileena and Kitana’s sibling bond or a noble version of Shang Tsung—add emotional weight amidst the flying limbs and exploding skulls.

It’s a popcorn thrill ride with more lore than you’d expect from a game that includes finishing moves where your opponent gets impaled by a flying ice dragon.

Mortal Kombat 1 looks stunning. Every character model is highly detailed, arenas are lush with atmosphere (from neon-soaked city streets to lava-drenched arenas), and the gore—well, it’s beautiful in its own twisted way. Blood physics have never been this... artistic?

The sound design deserves special mention. Punches thud with sickening satisfaction, and every Fatality is accompanied by squelches and crunches that make you wince in the best way. The voice acting? Surprisingly solid—though still campy, as it should be.

Online play is mostly smooth, thanks to robust netcode, but the progression system and live-service elements may not sit well with all players. Daily challenges, character unlocks, and cosmetics are sometimes locked behind grinds or microtransactions, which slightly dampens the package.

Invasions mode (the new single-player RPG-lite mode) is a clever twist, offering varied challenges, buffs, and loot across themed maps. It adds a layer of long-term replayability beyond ranked matches.

While the Kameo system adds innovation, it can be jarring for newcomers trying to keep track of double the threats on-screen. The tutorial does a decent job, but some deeper mechanics remain unexplained.

Also, not all characters feel equally balanced—early metas have shown a few clear frontrunners—and the roster, while iconic, feels a bit safe compared to past entries. No wild newcomers or real oddballs yet.

Mortal Kombat 1 is a bold reboot that respects its bloody lineage while embracing change. It’s gorgeous, punishing, and unexpectedly emotional in its storytelling. While the live-service elements and balance quirks hold it back from flawless victory, it remains one of the most complete and compelling fighters of this generation.

Best Served With: A controller in one hand, a bucket of popcorn in the other, and a stomach strong enough for spine-ripping Fatalities.

What MK1 does well:

[*] Soundtracks
[*] Visuals [/list]

What it doesn't:
[list]
[*] Online component (Lack of online lobbies, the game being inaccessible in regions like Africa)
[*] Character customization (Downgrade from Injustice 2, and MK11.)
[*] Monetization (Mostly in regards to Kombat Pack 2 and 1)
[*] Failing to live up to Ed Boon's promises of years of continued support. [/list]

What MK1 improved upon after its release:
[list]
[*] Fixing the desynchronization issues (overdue fix) and adding crossplay after a few months.
[*] Improving the single player experience, via adding the Towers of Time which give free dragon krystals weekly.
[*] Improving the game balance, and the kameo system, fixing issues like player one advantage, combo infinites, etc. [/list]",False,1,77783

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,195268938,"With MK1's DLC's coming to an end, here is my complete review of the game. 

Firstly, I would recommend this game on a discount, even while I'm disapointed overall as a fan of the series, I've still had a lot of fun on the game itself and the gameplay can be very fun and has a lot of the great traditional Mortal Kombat tropes which I love about the series. Some great new character designs that add something extra to some less refined characters, and some very cool actual kombat styles which make for fun gameplay to both play and watch. 

I will however go into the many issues this game has, and why the community turned sour on MK1.

- [b] There is no Krypt [/b]: I noticed this when I first loaded up the game, the unlockables area ""The Krypt"" which has been a recurring element of the MK games since Deadly Alliance in 2002, and had it's biggest showcase in the previous game (MK11) has been reduced to ""The Shine"" this was previously one small part of what was the Krypt in MK11, so having that direct comparison was a red flag. There isn't really any charm in the shrine, it's a chore to put your coins in and get the unshockable, originally you also had to open each shrine item one by one until they did fix this and allow 10 at a time. Although it's very surprising they even released it in a one item per opening format. 

- [b] Kameos [/b]: MK1 introduced the new ""Kameo"" system as it's big gameplay shift, and this has some positives, it can lead to some very creative gameplay and has made space for even more characters from the massive universe of MK to make appearences.

However, unfortunately, the gameplay experience for this isn't intuitive, or fun for many people. In higher level play, you'll also be seeing the same strategy with using the most overpowered kameo and pairing in general. While there isn't really an issue with the mode itself, the issue is that they introduced this as the only option of play. There is no single kombat mode, the mode that's existed in every single MK game, we are restricted to playing kameos all the time. It's incredibly simple to remove an assist option from gameplay (the kameos aren't even on screen until you activate them) there isn't much of an excuse here that even with so much community push back, there was never a single kombat mode provided.

- [b] The story [/b]: (Mild spoilers for the general direction of the story ahead)
The story itself is actually okay, at least at first. We get a reset of the timeline again, similar to MK9, and some of the characters are very entertaining, and you get some great chemistry between people also, like Cage and Kenshi. I also enjoyed the depiction of Reptile here, they leaned way too heavy into ""lizard"" reptile and they manged to meet in the middle here, giving us the human ninja look which is what most people were asking for. 

There are issues with this however. (MK11 spoilers) [spoiler] At the end of MK11, we are given a scene where Liu Kang greets another timelines Kung Lao, this implies the he might be there to guide them into being ""The Great Kung Lao"". [/spoiler] The Great Kung Lao story is one that's very important to the overall lore of MK, a lot of the main story comes to be based on this history, however we have no actually seen this story directly within an MK game, just those talking about it. So naturally a lot of players were excited about MK12/MK1 giving us this tale finally.

However, they went another direction and Kung Lao doesn't really get that treatment, they're a second player to Raiden, in a role swap with Liu Kang from previous games. The role swap if fine, but it is a repeat of the same story, when we had The Great Kung Lao story right in front of us, ready to be told, Kung Lao is always a great character, and he still is here, but he doesn't get to shine as much as you'd want.

[b] Multiverse: [/b] The multiverse was another key part of the MK11 story, and honestly when the multiverse trope gets added to a story, it's incredibly rare it gets better, no, it's usually gets worse. I think MK11 did a fine job with it overall and with it's ending it was a unique way to lead into another reset, I actually didn't mind it in MK11. 

In MK1 however, we just got a new reset and as you go further in, the multiverse becomes more and more prominent, and other than some funny elements of characters being mixed up into hybrids from other timelines (I enjoyed this) the way that it's such a prominent part of the story, it takes away a lot of the stakes and the actual connection you have with the characters when you're seeing there are tons of the same one.

Further to this though, the MK1 universe is MASSIVE, like I said earlier. You really do not need a multiverse, we already have tons of realms that remain included! One of the coolest parts of the MK story which MK Deception made a great point of was this hierarchy of power with The Elder Gods and The One Being, where it connects all the realms to something under the surface trying to regain power and take over once more. 

We get the reintroduction of Havik, a fan favourite from the Chaos realm. We get NOTHING about the order realm, no Hotaru, where are you gonna have Chaos realm without the Order realm? It just seems like with this focus on the multiverse, they missed what is right in front of them, they have this massive world to craft a great story from, and it's pretty easy to actually put it together when the pieces are already ready to go! I very much hope in MK2 we are over the timelines and back to how MK stories should be.

Finally, I need to address the thing which soured MK fans the most.

[b] WB Microtransactions: [/b] The MK fanbase is very vocal and loyal to the series, and due to this loyalty many purchased the special editions with hefty price tags, thankfully I avoided this as I didn't trust the value of it. One of the perks of buying the special editions was more Dragon Krystals, which are the premium currency in the game. Now, as it turns out, the amount you get and what you can do with them is pretty damn poor. I mean, VERY poor. You can buy perhaps one skin and one other cheaper item. 

The game that you paid full price for, while providing many other skins through gameplay (bare minimum) is locking all of the retro skins, the ones that are the most desireable from the long term fans of the series, behind an additional paywall! What a disgusting way to treat your long-term fans, don't allow them to earn the skins, make them pay even more money! Don't worry though, you can earn the 1000 dragon crystals you need to purchase one single skin. You just need to grind the game, oh but also, they capped the OVERALL amount you can earn if you 100% completed every single character and Kameo (which would obviously take a very long time) You could earn 5700 krystals TOTAL if you did absolutely everything, and even just months into the game if you wanted to grab a few announcer voice changes, and a couple of retro skins with a seasonal fatality, that would actually be impossible to obtain without paying more!

The way WB treated this IP is disgusting, it's absolutely no wonder why people immediately felt like they were being ripped off, i'ts because they were! Now you need to understand it was only months into the games release where you couldn't earn enough currency to buy the retro skins, they kept introducing more and more of these retro skins, you had no chance to earn them through playing your full priced game, they wanted more money. Like this is some free mobile game? Very confusing and the greed is as subtle as a WB rep showing up to your door and asking for you wallet directly. 

In closing I since hope WB are nowhere near this series by the time of the next release. Both Mortal Kombat and it's loyal fanbase deserves so much more than this.

From someone who has played MK games since i was young, this game was a throwback to most of if not all the previous games. Without spoiling anything, this games story is amazing (up until the last few chapters, where i feel it lost a lot of momentum) So for that alone, i'd recommend this game. 

But.

I bought the premium edition of the game, which was labeled and slated to have included all of the DLC'S that were upcoming to be released, which wasn't the case. 

So i essentially paid 100$ to play the game early and have Shang Tsung as a playable character? 

As well as WB and Netherealm studio's dropping the ""Definitive"" edition of the game just 2 years after its release and then suddenly dropping support for the game? something seems wrong. 

Great storymode, Online can be fun, but the Khaos Reigns DLC was underwhelming, and having paid 100$ for a version that didn't include the Character Packs seems like a bait and switch.

but i can't recommend this, years after years of being a fan of the franchise and loving the games (all of them) 
i'm sick and tired of WB pulling the most shamefull and absolute BS regarding the princing of their products

i paid full price for the premium edition pre order
then paid another 50 when khaos reings came (wich was waaaay overpriced for a dlc with a very bad written and pointless 2 hour story mode and just 6 characters, it was more than half the base game) 

ed boon promised years of support but we never really got any, the whole game feels unfinished, with missing features that where present in previous games (like creating a private room for online matches)
the only support this game had was the characters added and balancing patches that only buffed or nerfed characters based on how the game was played at a professional level (wich is only like 1-2% of their total player base)
the most interesting cosmetic items where all locked behind a paywall (until they added a way to earn currency in game, wich is very limited and grindy btw)

enraged by the low sales of the base game (probable cosmetic skins) and the massive lower sales of the expansion, WB decided to pull the final insult to the few people who got scammed by this game and decided to add a final ""definitive edition"" wich only has a new ""content"" a new skin for 6 character

i bought that ""upgrade"" only to find out that it didn't worked, it didn't add any of the new content, it just marked as ""purchased"" some items that can be unlocked via playing the game

this upgrade was obviusly listed badly, and they ""fixed now"" making it a full 60 dollar upgrade dlc

so to a player that already spent 130 dollars on the game, the character pack and the expasion, what is the ""thank you"" i got??? a 60 dollars new dlc that has 99.9% of the content i've already purchased and only 6 new skins, wich by the way i could get for half the price if i just buy the currency to get them in game

this not only made me decide NOT to buy this ""definitive edition"" but i also ended up uninstalling the game, and i don't think i'll ever buy a MK game again as long as NRS is managed by the imbeciles that are taking WB to bankrupcy ruining every single movie, tv show and videogames they produce
this an outrageous attempt from WB Games to milk every single penny of any idiot (like myself) that is willing to pay

if you're really a casual player, but a fan of the franchise and just insterested in seeing the story mode, go to youtube and watch it there
if like to fool around on towers or occasionally play with a friend, wait for a deep deep sale of the full package to get the most out of your money

if you're specting a full fledged game, well optimized and that offers a satisfying user experience, stay the hell away from this company, you might get a few hours of enterntainment, but in the end you'll just feel scammed by a multibillion dollar company that is runned by incompetents, because no matter how hard they try to rob us, the consumers they're so f***ing stupids that they're even failing, and miserably, to that as well",False,6,52327

You've already pissed me off enough with the Marvel-esque writing shit you pulled off in the story's later act and Khaos Reigns, but to be unable to even do the rivalry you've hyped in ""Homelander vs. Omni-Man Trailer"" right by giving Homelander—oh, Homelander, the guy who gets clowned on by memes for being a man-child in a cape—an ungodly amount of mixup tools to open the fuck out of your opponents blocking for their lives in the game where the only defensive option is Breaker and nothing else.

But Omni-Man, a thousand-year Viltrumite veteran who rips planets apart with the ease of making a sandwich, gets fuckton of unsafe in almost everything he does.

Omni-Man, outclassed by a goddamn bootleg Superman who cries and shoots laser everywhere when people don't like him?

You have only one job for the guest character rivalry of this game and you still can't even do it right.

And now that this game has all but confirmed its support is dead, I guess Omni-Man won’t be getting his runback against Homelander anytime soon, yes?

Bravo, NRS, bravo. You have disappointed me with both the direction your story is heading and the complete failure to deliver on the most hyped rivalry you had, a one-time dream match that you won't be able to do the rematch of again in the future MK games because ""guest character licensing"" reason, for the last time.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,194912856,"[b]TL;DR: Reject modernity, return to MKX[/b]

The biggest criticism that many people seem to have about this game is the [b]exuberant amount of money[/b] that needs to be shilled out in order to have access to all the characters, and I have nothing new to add to the conversation in that regard, other than simply state that [b]this is the first Mortal Kombat game I've owned without owning all of the characters[/b].

In terms of the actual game: the gameplay is very fresh for Mortal Kombat, the [b]kameos[/b] add a brand new level of depth to every match played, and the [b]air-combos[/b] are a very unique addition and an interesting way to develop on the pre-determined combo-based fighting that Mortal Kombat is known for. However all these innovations result in MK1 straying from the established Mortal Kombat formula, making it arguably a worse Mortal Kombat game than its predecessor MK11.

The graphics, much like all Mortal Kombat games, are very good in terms of visual quality. However they're starting to piss me off with the way they completely change how the people look with every single game. Liu Kang, the head honcho himself, looks nothing like he did in MK11. And this has been an issue for a while, but I think MK1 does it particularly egregiously. This is almost certainly on purpose, since the game is a ""reboot of the universe"", but that remains a stupid excuse to completely change how almost every character looks, to the point of unrecognisability for many of them if it wasn't for the power-rangers-esque color coding.

The character roster might be the strongest aspect that MK1 has over its predecessors. Every member seems [b]hand-picked to maximise fan-appreciation[/b]. All the classics are obviously present (Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Johnny Cage, you know the ones...), however some characters which were staples of the franchise have been removed or demoted to Kameo status (such as Jax, Sonya, Kano...) in order to make room for fan-favorites which were denied the spotlight for a long time (such as Havik, Ashrah, Reiko...).
As per usual, the [b]DLC roster is also very strong[/b], mostly composed of very fun and interesting characters, with a few inevitable misses thrown in there probably just because some people in the development team really wanted them in particular (2 Terminators back-to-back? Really??)

Overall Mortal Kombat 1 is a very interesting entry for the Mortal Kombat franchise, bringing many new ideas to the table and standing out as an instalment to really impact the franchise as a whole. However this is also why [b]it is much harder to recommend Mortal Kombat 1 over Mortal Kombat 11[/b].
The biggest factor in MK1 being a better choice than MK11 is the much more active multiplayer that comes with the advent of being the latest instalment of a series. However, for a strictly singleplayer/local gamer, MK11 might be the better choice, given that its Singleplayer mode (Towers of Time) is strictly better than the abomination that is MK1's Invasions.
At the end of the day, they are both equally good options for a Mortal Kombat game (which says a lot about how good MK11 really was that it still holds up to this day), and you should probably decide which one you want based on which roster interests you more.",True,14,5947

- Ed Boon on Twitter, September 24, 2024

So the developers decided to abandon this game with the Definitive Edition, despite that they promised this game would be supported for a long time after less than two years. Probably because Khaos Reigns was such a dissapointing expansion. Either that, or they are a bunch of greedy liars. The DLC pack was overpriced garbage with a story that is even worse written than the vanilla story, which is also terrible. I didn't even buy the DLC because I knew it would be a let down. I watched the story on youtube instead, and I instead of being a waste of time and money, it was just a waste of time. But I hoped that they would at least fix the abysmal single player content, as they promised to support the game for so many years. But now that is over, because of the NetherRealm/Warner Bros greed and lies.

The kameo system was a mistake as well. Combat gameplay is decent though, which is the only single positive that made the game worth playing prior to the Khaos Reigns DLC. I can't justify this filth despite being a veteran fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise.

The gameplay is better than the story but its gameplay is still inferior compared to other fighting games on the market.

Don't get the game. Just watch all the cutscenes or see someone else play the game if you care about story. There are better fighting games to invest time in that came out at a similar time like Street Fighter 6 or Tekken 8 and there are still better fighting games to play with ongoing support. I don't believe the game is fixable but if you ask me what I wanted from the next MK game it would be to stay away from timeline and reality warping shenanigans, make the story more grounded, not make outworld (especially and specifically outworld) or netherrealm the main antagonist again, bring back tag team mode and ring out stages, stop doing sh*tty video game crossovers, make better post game/side game content and stop catering to normies.",False,5,3218

What really blew me away was the character design—especially Homelander and Omni-Man. Their movements, dialog, and unique fighting styles are just incredible. These aren’t just guest characters thrown in for hype—they feel like fully fleshed-out additions with real weight and personality. The attention to detail in their animations and voice lines is next-level.

Mortal Kombat 1 has many flaws, some of them more severe then others. 

The fighter roster is a joke, some of the most iconic names in the mortal kombat franchise are either missing completely or only available as ""assist charakters"".
The strange buddy fighting system is a joke and completely useless.

But heres my main issue with MK1. The whole gameplay is just to throw your opponent in the air and hit him, while he is kind of floating in front of you as much as possible. Thats endgame. You dont have to learn to duck or dodge or counter or anything. If you want to win, you just memorize the juggle supercombos that keep your opponent in the air as long as possible. The game actually has its own training mode for that, choose a charakter, and the game tells you what the 6 best juggle combos are, thats it. now every one of those supercombos has the potential to roughly take 40% of your opponents health away. So MK1 is either doing juggle supercombos yourself and hitting your opponent while hes in the air for 40 seconds or watching yourself get hit while in the air for 40 seconds. Thats the game. You dont want to do the juggle combo bullshit? You are going to lose. No other playstyle is even remotely able to compete with the juggle combo bs.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,194727548,"On a sale, sure, I'd recommend it. For $30 UDS you get everything but two characters. Come on guys, you knew you were not going to get everything. It's the 2020's now.

Honestly, I'd almost recommend it at full price, but it is expensive if you want the full package with all the bells and whistles, and besides that, it does have issues. First and foremost is the fact there is time travel and multiverse elements in the story. This is where things go to die, it's never good, nor original. In fact, I'd argue it's cliche as hell, and very very lazy. I'm not even a huge story buff, but I don't enjoy these kinds of things, it just mucks things up for no good reason what so ever.

I'm also not a huge fan of it's Kameo system. It's not the worst thing ever, and I'm still having a blast playing it, but I'd much rather of had a flat out expanded character move set then a tag mechanic, but that's personal preference. I can say that there needed to be more of them. There more than what I'd call a handful sure, but some just seem so much better than others, and at the end of the day, it still really does feel like slim pickings with them.

I guess my biggest gripe, is the reptilian racism. I mean, Reptile has always been my main pick out of the roster, and I'm so happy he's back, but when you test your might and succeed, there is no clapping for him like the other characters. Not even the chirp of a cricket. Okay, this was a joke, but it is strange.

My real biggest complaint is of course the microtransactions. You just never want to see it. Thankfully it's not the worst here, but IT IS here, so I got to say a big resounding BOOOOOOO! A close second to that is the Animalities, were they drunk when they did these lol? I haven't even seen them all yet and I'm just like ... wait ... what? His name is Reptile right? There are lots of Reptiles on Earth ... right? So why did he just turn into a plant? Using Quan Chi, I'm like Oh, this has got to be an Octopus right, will all that Lovecraftian tenticles ... right? Nah, it was a T-Rex ... because, I don't know, maybe because Jurassic Park was cool once? By the way Takeda is an Octopus, you know, the guy who's element aligns with Fire? I mean they all must make sense in a way I'm just not getting. Like Smoke, a super stealth based Ninja turning into a rampaging Gorilla. Alright I got to stop, I could do this for all the one's I've seen save Scorpion. Thank God they didn't mess that one up, if he had turned into a f*ckin butterfly I wouldn't have been surprised by now, but seriously disappointed.

Lastly, the lack of modes. There isn't a whole lot to do apart from story, online, matches, and various arcade towers that seem more lifeless than they were in MK11. It feels rather stripped down without a proper Krypt or some other distraction mode that previous titles used to throw in there. 

All that aside. I really dig this game. Like the character designs, graphics are beautiful, animations are as great as they've ever been, move sets are great, finishers are fantastic, sound is amazing, music is killer, guest characters are enjoyable additions, voice actors did a great job. I mean, it's a good game, it's a beautiful game, but yes, given the flaws, I'd snag it on that juicy sale and enjoy it at a fair price.",True,0,1264

I dare say it's the best story I've ever experienced in a fighting game.
Back in MK9, I was thrilled with the reboot after Armageddon 
and never thought it would happen again after the story chaos in 10 & 11.

The game uses elements ranging from MK 4 to MK 11.
I thought it was a very good decision by the developers to relive some of the dramatic twists and see the origin stories of well-known characters retold cinematically.
It's as if they decided 15 years ago to move towards this very game with this very story.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,194299417,"Mortal Kombat 1 delivers stunning graphics and a roster of easy-to-pull-off moves that make it visually impressive and accessible for both newcomers and veterans. The game’s visual design is a significant step forward, with detailed character models, fluid animations, and atmospheric stages that truly bring the fight to life. The intuitive controls and straightforward mechanics allow players to execute signature moves with ease, making matches exciting and engaging.

However, despite these positives, the game feels like it falls short in content. Even with all the available DLC, the overall variety of modes, stages, and characters remains limited, leaving players wanting more after just a few hours of play. The lack of substantial single-player content and meaningful replay value diminishes its longevity, making the experience feel somewhat hollow.

Moreover, the pricing feels inflated considering the sparse content, leading to a sense of overpricing. Fans expecting a comprehensive package might find themselves disappointed, as the game’s core offering doesn’t justify its premium price point. As a result, Mortal Kombat 1 ends up feeling like a visually impressive but somewhat shallow experience—one step forward in graphics and accessibility, but two steps back in content and value.

In summary: Mortal Kombat 1 impresses visually and offers accessible gameplay, but its limited content and high price point overshadow these strengths, making it feel somewhat underwhelming and overpriced.

Story was a mess and did not really enjoy it, I personally heavily dislike the Kameo system and leads to some very unfun interactions, there is basically no customisation, invasions mode is very dull and a chore to complete, the lack of krypt was certainly a choice.

I was also heavily disappointed by both the lack of fan favourite characters and a heavily male dominated roster. Not to mention the amount of flop guest characters, again being completely male dominated. No Jade? No Sonya? No Skarlet?

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,194138654,"I was very invested in the early story, where it was a smaller scale, no fatalities, a simpler time for Mortal Kombat. Farmers and failures. And I was hoping that what would happen is we would see how we went from this peaceful time to the first actual Mortal Kombat. Like, I wanted it to be shocking that someone was killed, and I wanted to see an escalation, with both politics and violence until the characters were trapped an inescapable death tournament. 

Instead, we started off with a great story, then allllll the characters got on the crazy bus, and drove it off a cliff of... nostalgia? Or something? I was willing to accept Liu Kang and Raiden basically just changing roles, even tho it was boring. Because it also came with Baraka being a tragic good guy and a bunch of other good stuff! But I just started laughing after we just retreaded tired, old, and frankly bad storylines that didn't work in the 2000s. 

If you also start laughing at this, then you'll probably continue laughing as the story goes full loony tunes at the end and there's a character called John Kahner (Terminator) that is a mash up of Johnny Cage and Shao Kahn. Like, if you get to this point, just stop the game, restart at the beginning where Raiden is a simple farmer and realize they spent like 15 minutes of CGI time on Johnny Cage's fake movie as a gag, and ZERO TIME explaining why John Kahner even exists, or why you are back at the pyramid other than, ""I guess by now you realize we are just doing the 2000s game's storylines again, so Armageddon had to show up"". It's like the game director and story writer changed half way through. 

Sad. Waste of an opportunity to be quaint and small stakes again like the original Mortal Kombat. And for what, you pushed the storyline all the way back to the end of MK7 (MK8 doesn't exist), and MK9 was a COMPLETE REBOOT. So, you JUST rebooted in 11, and now in ""12"", we are right back to reboot AGAIN? 

Ok, so I mostly play MK for the single player. But let's talk gameplay. Basically, I didn't like it. I don't like calling in someone on the sidelines to help, I don't like the combo system as much as other games, I don't like how everyone is the same power level all the time, I don't like how I can't do fatalities in the story mode.

Kuai Liang is Scorpion? Are you kidding me?  Smoke recruiting a young Scorpion? What the hell is even going on? Either that's not Hanzo Hasashi, or Liu Kang destroyed the whole timeline just to play god.

Maybe, just maybe, this is an alternate timeline and the real MK universe still exists somewhere — but as of now, it feels like they spat on the original story.

And don’t even think for one second I’ll sugarcoat this just because the graphics and gameplay are good. Yeah, it looks pretty. Yeah, it plays well. But no amount of ray tracing is going to fix the fact they butchered everyone’s soul just to make space for new characters nobody asked for.

Some of the absolute clown changes they made:

Kuai Liang is Scorpion, not Sub-Zero. (Biggest disgrace.)

Smoke is a bro-tier human instead of a badass ghost ninja.

Baraka is a sick human now, not a savage Tarkatan warrior.

Mileena isn't a twisted clone; she's Kitana’s infected sister. (Why even bother?)

Sindel went from evil queen to ""loving mommy dearest.""

Shang Tsung is some used-car salesman scammer instead of the sorcerer that traumatized my childhood.

Raiden went from literal Thunder God to farm boy with lightning hands.

Havik and Reiko — ruined beyond recognition.

You didn’t ""reimagine"" Mortal Kombat, you completely gutted it.

I hope they don't even dare continue this garbage timeline because real Mortal Kombat fans — the ones who actually grew up with this — deserve way better than this.",False,3,16

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,193582995,"I give Mortal Kombat 1 a 7/10. The graphics are great, and the character lineup is one of my favourites in the MK series. The gameplay is decent, but there are some issues. My biggest issues with MK1 are the microtransactions, the lack of singleplayer content, the customisation system, and Kameos. The base game costs $70 CAD, but if you want to play as all of the (currently available) characters, you need to pay over $120! The Khaos Reigns bundle includes every DLC fighter except for Shang Tsung for some reason, who you have to buy for an additional $10. I don't blame the developers for this, I blame WB Games. The singleplayer content is also pretty underwhelming. After story mode, the only thing you can play by yourself is Invasions, or the towers of time. There's no Krypt, which was one of my favourite parts of MK11. The character customisation options are pitiful compared to MK11, which I think had the best customisation system in the series. The colour variations between skins are pointless, and you get one gear piece. You also can't make custom presets. I think that the Kameo system adds too much complexity to the gameplay, and should not be included in the next MK game. Many players like the Kameos, but I think they make the game harder for beginners to get into. Long story short, I would only buy this game when it's 50% off (or more).",True,6,6050

However, my laptop barely meets reccomended requirements (2gb less dedicated video ram), and so my gpu gets up to 80* C without fail everytime, which i can deal with, if my benchmark wasnt 45 fps, and an inconsistant 45 at that. constant frame drops. I think the game shouldnt require shaders, as i think thats what makes it unstable for lower end pcs. Not to mention the delay to start. Matches and loading screens take a while. Very annoying! It is honestly a better idea to buy this on your available console, I would even dare to say buy it on switch, and ive played it on switch, the crashing is more bare-able than the lag and fps drop.

Overall, fun game, but make sure you have good pc cooling and EXCEED the reccomended hardware

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,192998577,"MK1 is a beautiful game in terms of graphics and character design, but it is clear what direction they aim to take with future installments to the franchise from now on, and I am not sure I like it. The amount of additional transactions one has to make to simply have access to additional characters, cosmetics (which aren't an essential thing i guess) AND to even complete consequent parts of the story was truly not a wise decision to implement into this game. Some of the few pros of the game is that its achievements are far far easier to obtain than previous games (if you even care about that), and Invasions as an ""endgame"" mode was an interesting and entertaining addition to the franchise. Other than that, the game just feels like a cash grab from every single aspect.

Overall thoughts... I would suggest to just get the game on sale or something. As beautiful as the game is, I do not think it's really worth the price it has, especially if you take in consideration the additional amounts of money you'd have to pay in order to have access to more characters, kameos and even the next story section.

They don't feel as imaginative as past games and in some places feel phoned in. 

REALLY scummy microtransactions: 10/10

They've REALLY nailed it this game with the scummy Microtransactions! Worse than it's ever been so congrats! <3 I bought the bundle pack for full price (because im a dunce) and i STILL didn't have all the characters! Yep! A character that's literally IN the game ALL ready to go.. is £6.99. Want A costume from older games? Buy some in game currency and unlock it instantly! no more messing around with challenges or unlocking it by doing a certain task/milestone. 
Seriously, WB are a really scummy bunch of so and so's.
Want more after completing the game?! Why not try the WAY over priced DLC 'story' that's 5 chapters of NOTHING that ends EXTREMELY abruptly with NOTHING added to the new lore.    


Would I recommend it? I'm sorry but I can't. I LOVE MK. I love the story and characters. I even love the new timeline idea.. but the way they've obviously removed content to try and Milk you dry is awful. 
I don't mind worthwhile DLC etc but none of the DLC/costumes are worth the asking price and it's shoved down your throat constantly.

The cameo system was quite fun, definitely a change from previous titles, but I found it quite depressing that it was a replacement for what I had come to know, instead of just being its own separate mode.
While not being a huge fan when it comes to some of the character redesigns, and the continuation of the timeline multiverse stuff, the story mode was honestly a total blast, and something I very much enjoyed and can see others having a great time with.

The servers are pretty bad, every cut scene before and after a fight is laggy (Although the game play seems to be okay.)
The new systems are unwanted, Kombos are too long and don't feel as bone breaking or impactful.
Just an overall down grade from previous games and i wish the series could rise back to glory.

        [td]Mortal Kombat 1 is a visually stunning fighter with a genuinely fun core gameplay loop. The switch to Unreal Engine 4 pays off handsomely, and the fighting mechanics are as solid as ever. Unfortunately, this potential is hamstrung by significant drawbacks: a poor online experience due to limited server infrastructure, performance stutters possibly linked to Denuvo, a lackluster story mode, and expensive DLCs.

If you primarily play offline locally and can overlook the campaign's weak narrative and occasional performance hiccups, there's enjoyment to be had. However, players prioritizing online competition or seeking good value for their money should approach Mortal Kombat 1 with caution, fully aware of its substantial flaws.[/td]

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,191983450,"[h1] MK1 Review  [/h1]

I had a lot of fun playing through the story mode. I really like the new [i]aerial playstyle[/i] combined with the [i]Kameo[/i] system. However, most [i]Kameo[/i] fighters are not playable as main characters, which is a bit disappointing. Kameos are a new feature designed to strengthen your character’s weaknesses and help you either exploit the enemy’s weaknesses or defend against them.

The [i]aerial combat[/i] in MK1 feels smooth and well-executed. Besides the story mode, there are solo gameplay options like Invasions, which adds more content. However, this mode alters some of the game’s core mechanics by introducing elemental types, character upgrades, and other RPG-like features. It’s a unique addition—you’ll either love it or hate it.

[b]The main story[/b] is solid but not particularly long. Unfortunately, the [b]Khaos Reigns[/b] story mode is even shorter, especially when compared to the main campaign. Only get [b]Khaos Reigns[/b] for the action—otherwise, it's totally not worth the price!

All in all, I would recommend getting the game if you’re a fan of the [b]Mortal Kombat series[/b] or if you’re looking for a unique fighting game with a story mode.

 [*] Steep learning curve for newcomers to fighting games
 [*] Not all characters are available for free
 [*] Underwhelming tower system

Apparently not, because I have to sit there and pray to my lord and savior that I can get a move off in 0.5  of a second.

Secondly, this game is a huge step down from MK11, obviously. The customization options are absolutely terrible, to the point where I look at MK11 and end up reinstalling it.

Third, Havik players, count your days. This is such a massive downgrade from MK11, which was a consecutive Evo game, but MK1 is so bad that they didn’t even give it an Evo spot. WHO THE HELL ASKED FOR KAMEOS??? I have to sit there while a Raiden, Scorpion, Noob, or anyone else does an 80% combo while their Kameo character strokes them off to extend it.

From the moment I started playing, I was blown away by the impressive variety of unlockables, nostalgic callbacks to past games, and stunning visuals that bring every fatality to life in jaw-dropping detail.

The single-player Kampaign Part 1 was an absolute joy, and after finishing it, I sat captivated through the entire Kredits sequence. Seeing literally two million talented people credited showed me just how much passion, effort, and dedication has been poured into making this masterpiece shine so brightly.

This is Mortal Kombat at its absolute finest—fast-paced, polished, clever, and richly rewarding. If you're even remotely a fan of fighting games, you owe it to yourself to jump into this phenomenal, lovingly crafted experience.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,191834941,"This might genuinely be the *WORST* Mortal Kombat game of all time. Worse than Mythologies, worse than Special Forces, worse than MK vs DC. The kameo system is unbalanced, unfun, and ruins the experience singlehandedly. That's not even accounting for the god awful story line, horrific character redesigns, pathetic guest characters, sleep inducing bonus modes, and Megan Fox.

Let's start with the story: It begins after timeline number 3 began (right after #2 got ruined once it started to become interesting in the MKX comic) and the Mortal Kombat tournament hosted in Outworld, which is led by Sindel, Kitana, and Mileena. Turns out, Shang Tsung from MK11 has his own timeline where he won the final fight in aftermath and decides to attack Liu Kang's timeline. Sound confusing? You're not the only one who felt this way. Long story short, Pyramid of Argus fight between all the ""titans"" from the main roster of characters leading to Shang Tsung and Quan Chi being defeated, The End. Or is it? Well Titan Havik didn't like not being involved so he decided to try and destroy the timeline too. 2 hours later of boring as hell story later and he's defeated, Bi Han is Noob but not evil ig because silly god magic or something, and all's well. Or is it? Yeah it is.

Netherrealm decided to redesign several characters. Havik is now Darrius even though Darrius is already in the game. If you're not aware, Darrius was a citizen of Orderrealm (Seido), but is the leader of the resistance, a group trying to take down the oppressive regime of the government. Havik is now that. Ashrah now isn't locked into the Netherrealm due to her demon roots, slaying other demons and other villainous creatures to purify her soul. She's now just able to leave the Netherrealm but somehow still shackled to it? They never explain it very well. Takeda is now Kenshi's cousin, and is also part of the Shirai Ryu, even though the creation of the clan was never shown during any part of the story, even in Khaos Reigns. Cyrax is pretty much what Takeda and Kung Jin were in MKX. Rebellious kids involved in a cutthroat group. Sektor is like her keeper, and is kinda just an asshole, even though Sektor and Cyrax were almost always close allies who trusted one another. Tarkatans are no longer a race, but a disease, which makes little to no sense and really isn't necessary to any part of the story apart from tying Mileena to the Tarkatans while still being a regular person. Scorpion is now Kuai Liang, which makes it down right impossible for Sub Zero to ever exist in another Mortal Kombat game, unless Hanzo is going to just randomly be a cryomancer in the next game (if there is one).

MK9 and MKX focused on horror icons. Freddy, Jason, Leatherface, Alien, and Predator all fit the games fairly well in terms of the themes of MK and the tone/direction the series was going in. MK11 was about action/super hero film main stays that had new projects releasing like Joker, Spawn, Terminator, and Rambo. Terminator, Rambo, and RoboCop were a bit silly and didn't belong in MK in my opinion, but it wasn't THAT bad. Now in MK1 we have random bullshit like 3 characters with a different coat of paint in Omni Man, Homelander, and Peacemaker, Conan the Barbarian, the T-1000, and Ghostface. None of these characters belong, none of them make sense, and half of them have been irrelevant since the 90s. I hate guest characters from franchises that aren't fighting games, because it's just cheap cash grabs, but when I saw KP2's guest characters I gave up hope on NRS to give fans anything good for bonus content post launch.

Invasions is terrible. I really can't explain it all that well. It's kinda like a table top rpg with really easy or brutal fights sprinkled throughout. It's not worth playing unless you want recolor #932. What sucks even more is that the mode was really enticing when it was first shown off, and it was hyped up a lot. Seasonal bonus content? Feels like the 3D era Konquest modes? Expansive rpg elements? Boy was that all lies and deceit. 

Megan Fox is the worst voice actor ever. I did a video series playing the story mode and I had to pause the game because I was dying of laughter from just how god awful she is at voice acting. She's not a great actor by any means, but she's definitely not terrible. However, if you put her in a VO booth get ready for the T-6900 to be reading lines like an illiterate 3rd grader. Just disgusting that NRS thought her performance was acceptable. At least Ronda Rousey gave a shit.

Overall, MK1 just might kill the franchise. I genuinely don't see myself being excited for MK13 when that gets announced, and I make it my job to play this series. Mortal Kombat is my favorite game series of all time. Deception is my favorite game of all time. Hell, most of my top 10 favorite games ARE Mortal Kombat, but MK1 might actually be my least favorite game of all time.",False,1,1988

If the paywalls weren't enough, the game doesn't add anything shockingly new to the series. Some new mechanics here, updated graphics there, but overall its like a COD game, nothing new just a paintjob and some marketing crossovers.

The campaign is very cinematic and actually sets up the stakes and character motivations, which is something most games in the genre fail to do.

[h3] Replayability [/h3]
There's plenty of seasonal singleplayer content, but it admittedly has balancing issues, making it mostly a trivial grind if you distribute your stats right.

[h3] Controls [/h3]
The controls are less complex than Street Fighter's and Tekken's and should be easier for new players to get into.

[h3] Online Play [/h3]

[h3] Pricing [/h3]
Many people have rightfully complained about overpriced additional content. However, the base game is enjoyable enough. If you can look past the occasional main menu popup advertising new content, it's fine.

[h3] Performance & Loading Screens [/h3]
You'll want to take the system requirements seriously as stutters etc. can be quite disruptive in this type of game. I did enjoy the game even on my old GTX 1080, but I do not recommend it. I've since upgraded to a 5080.

The worst of it is the shader compiling. After every update, you'll find yourself in a very long loading screen when booting up the game. This is a terrible choice in terms of user experience and it's ironically punishing the people that the content updates are supposed to draw back in.

Mortal Kombat 1 is absolutely phenomenal! It's easily the best fighting game I've played recently and arguably the peak of the Mortal Kombat franchise. The gameplay is incredibly polished, the visuals are breathtaking, and the overall experience is fantastic.

I was also incredibly pleased and grateful to see that this Steam version includes full Arabic language support! This is a fantastic addition for the large Arabic-speaking player base on PC, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the story and navigate the menus in our native language. Thank you to the developers for implementing this on the PC platform.

However, this excellent support on PC makes it even more baffling and quite surprising that the same Arabic language support seems to be missing from the console versions (PlayStation/Xbox) of the game. Why is there this disparity? Many players prefer consoles, and it feels strange that they don't have access to the same localization features that are clearly ready and implemented on the PC version.

It would be great if NetherRealm Studios and WB Games could bring parity across all platforms. I sincerely hope they consider patching in Arabic language support for the console versions as well, so that all Arabic-speaking fans can enjoy the game fully, regardless of their chosen platform.

Overall, Mortal Kombat 1 on Steam is a masterpiece, and the inclusion of Arabic here is highly appreciated and a major plus. I wholeheartedly recommend it. My main point of feedback is the hope that our fellow players on console receive the same language support soon!",True,0,4457

Mortal Kombat 1 reboots the legendary franchise with a fresh timeline, offering a cinematic story mode, refined mechanics, and an engaging multiplayer experience that makes it a worthy addition to the series. While it delivers a fantastic core gameplay experience, some of the new features may not fully resonate with longtime fans, and the absence of certain classic elements leaves room for debate.

A Compelling Story with High Production Value
NetherRealm Studios has once again crafted an impressive narrative-driven experience. The story mode is a highlight, blending high-quality cinematics with intense battles to tell an intriguing tale of a reimagined Mortal Kombat universe. The new timeline brings unexpected twists to familiar characters, making even long-time fans question their allegiances. The voice acting and motion capture are top-tier, adding emotional weight to the experience.

Refined and Satisfying Combat
At its core, Mortal Kombat 1 continues the franchise’s tradition of tight, responsive gameplay. The combat feels fluid, strikes land with satisfying impact, and character animations are polished to near perfection. The balance between accessibility for newcomers and depth for competitive players is well executed. Kameo fighters add an extra layer of strategy, though their implementation may take some getting used to for series veterans.

Smooth and Stable Performance
Technical stability is another major strength. Whether playing on high-end PCs or consoles, the game runs smoothly, with minimal performance issues. Online connectivity is solid, with responsive netcode ensuring fair and enjoyable matches. The visuals are stunning, featuring detailed character models, beautifully designed stages, and gruesomely over-the-top fatalities.

Multiplayer: A Strong Competitive Scene
Online play is an excellent experience, with ranked matches, casual lobbies, and a strong matchmaking system. The rollback netcode ensures fights feel fair and responsive, making it an ideal battleground for both casual and competitive players. The variety of modes helps keep multiplayer engaging, from classic one-on-one fights to tournament settings.",True,1,1463

The pace feels sluggish—like, where’s that snappy, fluid combat I loved in MK11? Everything moves slower, the mechanics feel clunky, and it’s just not as tight or responsive. I used to rip through fights in MK11 without breaking a sweat, but MK1? It’s like wading through mud.

And don’t get me started on the story. I was expecting something epic, but it’s a total disappointment. It’s all over the place, lacks the punch MK11 delivered, and honestly feels like they phoned it in. The whole vibe is off—gameplay’s a chore, and the narrative’s a snooze.

On top of that, this game just isn't quite what it should be; it's a step back from MK11 in all the worst ways.
Among other things, they returned to the standard 3-gauge super meter system (although keeping fatal blows as opposed to x-ray attacks), which isn't that big a deal on its own (personally I prefer the dual-meter system MK11 had), but they made executing enhanced specials SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult than in MK11. 
You have to be practically frame perfect in order to execute one. They're even harder than in MK9/MKX, which the system was derived from-- I can fairly consistently proc enhanced specials in MK9, but in MK1, it's a fucking dice roll. This is even more annoying because doing enhances in MK11 was 100% consistent and I can pull it off nearly every time (since the timing is AFTER you input the special, instead of JUST BEFORE you press the face button to execute the move).

The Kameo system is just... Boring, really. I'm not sweaty enough to say whether it's busted or useless, but I can say I spent most of the story mode almost never using Kameos because it just wasn't fun or satisfying to engage with. It feels extremely gimmicky and like a game mechanic the devs would toss in last-minute in a final level, rather than the ""redefining new mechanic"" it's almost marketed as. I just don't enjoy it at all and think the game would be better off without it.

And now for something completely subjective; I really don't like the redesigns for most of the cast. I do like Reptile's design, at the least, but the other redesigns of Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Raiden, etc. all just kind of blend together into ""young eastern fighter guy"". I'm also just personally not a fan of Liu Kang's new ""fire god"" look.

Stage interactions are gone and stage fatalities are gone, kostumes are sorta gone, moveset customization is gone. You know the pre-fight dialogue, the feature so good that other fighting games started copying? Well, I guess since they ever so slightly slowed competitive matches, they're almost completely gone. The only interactions are at the end of the fighter select in Versus mode.

There's still something here though. The stages may not be that interactable but they have good music and look good. You don't really need to customize your moveset when they gave every fighter all the kombos and specials they could ever want. Kostumes are still bad; you get a lot of gear but no loadouts. You can't change your costume in the fighter selected screen, you have to manually go to 'Kustomize' and equip the gear and palette that you want. That or you can let the game randomly choose for you between each match (why???).

Guest characters are justified, but locking the MAIN ANTAGONIST of the game behind a paywall is actually insanely greedy.

It's a wonderful gore fest. Brutal as ever and extremely satisfying to play. For me it was the sole reason that convinced me to buy the game and I don't regret it.

Character roster is strong, there is plenty to pick from, even if you don't buy any of the DLC. It's fair to note that Shang Tsung can't be played unless you pay for unlocking him (ridiculous decision by NRS). Quan Chi being a DLC is also a bit annoying. But if you decide to spend some extra cash, you won't be disappointed. Guest characters are extremely well done both visually and in gameplay.

Kameo system is alright, I don't have anything good nor bad to say about it. I'm not one of those crazy combo sweats, so I'm mostly using Kameos as block string fillers or long rage poke tools. If the system was removed all of a sudden, I wouldn't even notice.

Singleplayer content is a bit lacking. Story is forgettable and lack a solid hook. Play it to watch some cinematics. Aside from that you have your standard Towers and the new Invasions mode, which I personally played 2 or 3 times before forgetting about it. Some character specific combo challenges, but that's pretty much a standard these days. Ultimately, it's fine but nothing special.

Cosmetics are hit or miss. Some DLC costumes look really cool, but generally most of default ones are uninspired or plain ugly. Add to that the fact that DLC store works on a weekly rotation, showing only around 10 costumes each week. If you're looking for a specific costume for your favourite character, better check in every week to see if it finally appeared. It's like they don't want you to spend money on the game. The currency for buying them can be earned through the singleplayer modes, which is nice.

The game is entirely held by it's brutal presentation and cool cinematic moves. Everything else about it is either mid or just bad. I enjoyed my time with it and I like returning to it every now and then, but don't expect a top class fighting game.

Linux experiences some performance issues while running this game. It's very choppy, especially during cinematic moments. There may be a fix for it, but I couldn't find one. It plays great on Windows though.",True,1,4736

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,191063698,"I was worried about the reviews, so I've waited to buy it on sale, for 22% of the release price. Honestly even for 50% I wouldn't have regretted the purchase.

For context, I played MK4, 9, 10, and 11.

+ graphics are amazing
+ I really enjoyed the first half of the story (I mean first half of ""Part 1"", haven't played ""Part 2"")
= second half of the story is OK, felt a bit chaotic and generic to me but still OK
+ UX is great (with one ""but"": I would usually leave the game for the day after a given chapter's final cinematics, when the ""Chapter X"" subtitle appeared, announcing a new chapter with new characters, which seemed like the logical place to do this, but when I started the next session it would make me watch the previous chapter's cinematics again, as apparently they are treated as a single cinematic with the next chapter's opening ones; my advice would be to watch them until the first fight of the new chapter and only then quit the game... but then again, rewatching more cinematics is a good way to bring you back into the story so maybe it's not bad)
+ as for gameplay itself, I've never really played these games competetively (except with friends) so I'm not an expert, but to me it seems pretty similar to MK11 which is OK; I feel like maybe a few classic moves for my favourite characters are missing but then again if I wanted to play the same game over and over again, I would not have bought a new one
+ character selection is decent
= I was worried about being force-fed characters from other universes, as I hate crossovers, but none of that was in the main part of the game (except maybe for an ad popup about T-1000 in the main menu); still though I would prefer it if they weren't in the game at all (like in the character selection) as this breaks the immersion for me if I see the Scream guy there, for example
+ I've recently upgraded so dunno about performance / optimization, but on 7950X + 4080S I've got stable 60 FPS (it's capped at that even without VSync, for gameplay reasons I'd assume)
- as far as I understood it, the negative reviews were mainly for ""Warner Bros.' greed""; they mentioned the need to pay extra for ""half of the story""; I was wondering what all that was about, but it instantly becomes clear when you start a new game, with a big screen letting you choose between ""Part 1"" (what you bought) and ""Part 2"", which is locked until you buy DLC... I mean I'm fine with more content being available, but if I buy a game, I want the whole story, and then maybe some side stories in DLCs... which kinda IS the case here, I guess, as the Part 1 story seems pretty much complete in itself... so maybe it's just the way they put it that triggers something in people... either way, you can always watch Part 2 on YT
+ main story (Part 1) took me about 10 hours (repeated maybe 2 or 3 fights), I think it's fair for the price I payed, plus of course there are Towers, multiplayer, some challenges etc. so there's plenty of content
- the Invasions mode does seem a bit silly to me, as someone mentioned, but maybe I just happened upon a stupid one this season",True,0,698
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,191054397,"I want to refund this shit because I'm tired of it. Tired of it taking 100+ GB of Space on my PC. Tired of getting laggy matches against sweat lords who have not stopped playing. MKX is WAY better than this trash. 

This game is so bad, it's not even a Mortal Kombat game. It feels rushed, incomplete and ultimately it only got two years of support. Which for the price, is a joke. Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6 are WAY better games. Not only does this game have so much bullshit in it. Like Kameos, Overpowered DLC characters and more. 

Call me a complainer, give me clown rewards. I do NOT care. This game is dead, it has less players on it on PC than TEKKEN 7! Tired of getting matched against people in 'Ranked' who are higher levels than me or people who are in the lowest tier bracket but are level 300. This isn't a 'Ranked' Mode. I can control who I verse in Tekken and SF. If I wanna verse harder opponents I can, but if I wanna wait a little longer to get someone my skill level. I can. That is what this game is missing.

The 6 hour long story was ""Decent"" at best I cant even recommend buying the game on sale.",False,17,406
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,191035051,"As someone that is a really big fan of MKX, I really don't find this game that bad. I know a lot of MKX fanboys are calling this game the worse thing ever, but I disagree. MKX is still my favorite, but I think this game is pretty good. I don't really have a lot of hours since I like watching these games A LOT more then playing them, but I still feel like I can form a good opinion.

Pros:
1. The graphics and animations are absolutely stellar (if your computer/console can run it). This is definitely one of the game's highlights; it looks amazing. All the stages are super well detailed, with a bunch of them having time of day options. The stages don't have interactables anymore, though, which is sort of unfortunate since I feel like that was something that defined the NRS fighting games. The animations all pop and look incredible, such as Raiden's electricity, Sub-Zero's ice, and T-1000s mimetic poly alloy. 

2. The DLC fighters are really damn good (not necesarilly in gameplay). They all look great and sport a ton of references to the source material. I was kind of iffy about the lineup this time around, but NRS has certainly proved me wrong. NRS has put a ton of effort into these fighters, especially with Ghostface, T-1000, and Noob Saibot. 

3. The roster is pretty good. I know the roster isn't finished (hopefully), but it already includes a ton of fan favorites that were missing from the previous titles, along with polishing some characters (like Baraka). The only really ""missing"" characters are Jade, Skarlet, Kabal (reimagined with T-1000), Kotal (reimagined with Conan), and the rest of the combat kids. Some characters also got sidelined as a kameo (will get to that later). I also appreciate how they included a lot of 3D era characters that have been missing for many years. All in all, very solid and a lot of these ""missing"" characters have been rumored to possibly return (mainly Jade and Cassie).

4. The gameplay is very solid. It strikes a pretty good middle ground between the super fast paced MKX and snail paced MK11. Pokes are actually punishable and moves that are supposed to be unsafe actually feel unsafe and punishable (for the most part, though it really comes down to matchup knowledge). Every character fits their niche well and nothing feels super OP (like unreactable mix in MKX and zoning in MK11). 

5. The game has proper modding support which is always a good thing. You can do stuff like change the character models to whatever you like, which has never been heard of in other NRS titles. 

Cons: (a lot of these will be personal issues)
1. The customizability is a severe downgrade from MK11 (and Injustice 2). They reverted back to singular skins and then added a million color palettes that no one asked for. Yes a lot of the skins do look good, but the MK11 customization would have simply been much better.

2. I personally don't like needing three bars to break. I feel like it encourages you to hold your meter and camp with it, which can be pretty lame. You also need your kameo active to break which is kind of silly in my opinion. If I have the meter I should be allowed to break, no questions asked. I think MKX did it better with the two bar breaker (thank God it's not MK11's garbage breakway at least). 

3. I still don't like fatal blow. I think comeback mechanics are good for fighting games, but not like this. It's scaling can be really strange; it can either do little to no damage or double your combos damage. A lot of them feel cheap in the sense where you can rob your opponent with little to no skill involved, or you can anti-air them for guaranteed damage since they are armored on startup and you can't block in the air in NRS games. I guess it's not the worst thing they could have brought back from MK11 (regenerating bars and breakaway can go to hell). I think DBFZ did it best with the ""sparking"" mechanic (not really with last stand, though).

4. The game and DLCs are hella expensive. Definitely wait for a good sale if you want to pick this game up. I think I bought it for 50% off. 

Mixed:
Well, here is the elephant in the room: the kameo system. I think it's great in some ways and bad in others. It's good in the sense that it can produce some really sick combos and make some gnarly setups. It includes a ton of different MK characters which is good in the sense that they are IN the game, but bad in the sense that you can't actually play them. I feel that only a few kameos are actually viable for each character, and obviously there's a meta and everything, but the goal is to at least make all of them somewhat viable. When considering no kameo, every character is still pretty viable (except Tanya lol). Playing a character with a bad kameo (for your character) can just feel like straight up losing since they sometimes matter more than your actual character. Some kameos are straight up useless with certain characters. On the other hand, some can feel pretty broken. You can now do grab combos with kameos, which is cool, but it reeks of krushing blow grabs from MK11, which were stupid af in my opinion. MK1 also brings the return of armored launchers, which will give any MKX player a heart attack. Armored launchers are dumb and there's a reason why they were mostly purged from MKX (they still exist but only for a few characters and they are two bars so sort of balanced I guess). You can also confirm mix that normally wouldn't lead to anything to full combos. For example, Havik is super top tier now because his primary mid string is a 50/50 between low and command grab which he can combo both with Mavado kameo. Other characters like Scorpion get near full screen conversions with Ferra and Homelander can confirm his insanely fast command grab also with Ferra (I see a theme). Overall, I commend NRS for trying something new with the kameo system, but I am personally not the biggest fan.

If you're an MK fan, you should definitely check this game out. If you're a general fighting game fan, you will probably enjoy this game, but have more fun with Street Figter or Tekken. I don't think WB should pull the plug on this game, though. It still has a lot of room to grow with new fighters, new story expansions (make Onaga the main villain again please NRS), and gameplay tweaks. If they do pull the plug, though, at least we will have Injustice 3! (yay?)

Edit: I realized I never even spoke about the story. I thought it was pretty good up until the mutliverse bullshit. I know everyone says this, but the mutliverse crap is really that bad. I thought the story would have been a charming kung-fu story with good humor, but NOO. Also, the Khaos Reigns story expansion sucks dick. The only things I liked about it were that they brought the kamidogus back and that khaos realm looks really cool. That's it. The actual story really had no substance since everything basically returned back to where it was at the end. I get Bi-Han is an asshole, but crashing your brother's wedding is top-tier hating. The dragon language stuff was interesting, I guess. Some random multiverse Rain dies, and they clearly tried to make you care, like I don't give a shit we barely got to know him at all lol. Havik throwing a temper tantrum when his kamidogus got stolen really painted him like a little bitch. He also gets packed up by his own creation, which is comedic at best, and then Noob Saibot bascially gets locked in gay baby jail afterwards. Like, ok?? The endings for Sektor, Cyrax, and Noob Saibot obviously hint at more, but they aren't canon at the end of the day. At least Sektor and Cyrax are playable now (I don't really care about the gender swap) and Noob Saibot is cool as fuck, so the DLC was good when ignoring the shitty story.",True,0,4587

great game, very fun action!

BUT!!!~!

Holy crap! why the hell are the charging so much for the 2nd combat pack!!~!???  

Its nearly as expensive as the base game!

Ill probably pick up a couple individual characters, but hell to the NO on that price!!!

Tekken an SF6 are a lot cheaper... i get the added story mode, im sure its fun, but i play to learn and eventually get my late azz online once i get down the new mechanics... i suppose im glad i was late cuz with KP1 ive got a whole lot to exp[lore... hopefully it goes on sale at some point soon... 60% off sounds about fair...",True,0,13274

The animations have never been cleaner, making every fight feel smoother than ever. The only thing I wish they had kept is Liu Kang’s classic screams—he was my main in previous MK games, and that iconic sound just added to the experience.

This game is ok, not the best MK, but good at this price for the content it offers. The game is more colourful than MK11, Kameos are fun and there are some new and interesting characters. As someone who plays only the single player mode and no multiplayer, I would say that the story mode is good, and I actually like the invasions mode since it provides a lot of fights with varying parameters. They also kind of mix 2 characters into 1 in invasions, so fights feel fresh. Also the fights and characters change each season (around 60 days) so things are kept fresh. Towers is almost the same as MK11. There is no crypt, something that I loved in MK11 and surely missed here.

The only thing I disliked is the character customization. Most customizations are same looks in different colours, or a slight variation. The good stuff is behind premium currency, which I will never buy.

A truly remarkable achievement for such small indie studio not backed by a giant media conglomerate. Thank you Zaslav, very cool.

Edit: After a whole butt of finagling through task manager, Process Lasso and so on, I could manage to stabilize the fps. Basically you have to not only disable non 3D cache / E cores through Process Lasso for the game's .exe or else it will use whatever core it wants, you have to give it almost realtime priority in CPU, I/O, memory...

The good. I love MK! I've been playing MK since I was 13 and I'm now 46! 33 years! 33 MFK YEARS! Anyway, I'll probably never stop playing MK unless they mess it up real bad and I'm sorta ashamed to say that. With that being said, for the most part, I actually like this game. The graphics are pretty phenomenal although the optimization was not so great at first (I haven't had any graphical issues in a minute). The series has looked good for awhile now and although imo this looks better than 11, I'm not sure how much better. 11 looked really good. The fatalities, brutalities and animalities were great in this one! Especially the animalities.  I actually like the invasions so those were a plus for me. Other than that it is just ok in comparison with the rest of the series.

The bad. At first I had issues with the optimization. After a few patches, and waiting a significant amount of time for shader building (almost everytime I want to play) the game runs OK. I say ok because for a AAA this pricey it is nothing special. It is what it should be but nothing more. The main story is... bad. Not horrible, imo, but definitely bad. Once again, for the money we are all paying the story should be better and include fatalities or something. I just wanted to get through it to unlock characters. If the story is going to be that bland I though they should at least make it shorter, or funnier? For me the cameos were somewhat bad. Ive gotten used to them but I'm pretty sure I don't like the idea of not being able to fight without them. I wouldn't say the cameos are bad but I do think the implementation was. It's not a bad game but it is not a good game either besides the fact it is MK! MORTAL KOMBAT! Sorry.

The ugly. I am tired, and I mean f$^&*n! exhausted, at this garbage of a crap DLC story and ""extra"" characters for the price of a full game! What is the deal?!!!! Yeah I want to play crap characters like Conan, Ghostface and T-whatever but only enough times to see all their fatalities. Yeah I could just go watch them on whatever but I actually want to do the moves myself. Then I could give a sh1+! You really want me to pay $50 for that. And wait for the extra content?! Fah Q!! I'll wait... until it drops down to almost nothing to purchase. Not only that but this game has become, like many, a micro transaction nightmare. 

My fatality: back, forward, down, down, front kick. I recommend this game at the low price of$25. If you can get it for that, NIKE. If not, I don't think it's worth it. I think thats what I paid, or close to it. I would never pay $60 or even close and I definitely wouldn't buy the DLC. We all need to stop supporting that garbage. MYSELF INCLUDED",False,83,3510

Been having an absolute blast with this game! The combat feels smooth, the fatalities are as brutal as ever, and the roster is great. It’s a perfect mix of old favorites and new blood (pun intended). 

That said, the paid DLCs are a bit much. I get it, everyone needs to make money, but it's honestly starting to feel like the game isn’t quite finished unless you drop some extra cash. Feels a bit scummy.

What is good is the size of the characters on screen -they are smaller than in MK11. Too bad the dull, uninspired character designs and monetization tactics are letting down the game tremendously.

Spent $120 on this game around release + all DLC and can't even play the game. 

EDIT: After the T-1000 patch, it seems to at least be playable which is nice, I've been having a lot of fun on the game again but they really do need to add more content.

Seems much more realistic than before when they only said one and the same phrase all the time. Gameplay is adaptable, understanble and quite easy to memorise and perform after some practice. Main story is cool. Invasions are fine except for the ""Survive"" with saws (really difficult ones and irritating). Towers are my favourite, play them all the time. 
Yet a couple of things that cathes the eye and there is no way you can explain them even out of magic perception. 
First: Nitara's wings just disappear during Fatalities and Brutalities. Like, where do they go one of a sudden? It's probably a glitch.
Second: In Kung Lao's Brutality ""Grind Away"" he thwors his has into opponent's chest and stay there, but at the same time Kung Lao already has a hat on his head. Since when he's got 2 hats? Even if to take into concideration that his hat is magical and it returns to him, there is still no way he can have 2 hats. So, it also seems to be a glitch. Hope they fix these two soon.

I really try to support MK i am a big fan of the story and lore, and I pre-purchased the last few releases, only for the game to be on sale at steep discounts a few weeks after. 

But after MK9, MKX and MK11, MK1(23) is for a lack of a better or nicer word, disappointing.
1. The story mode was not as engaging, and there are too many changes to lore. Expansion story was too short, and to me, was just selling and using unwanted / unsold assets from the Season of Khaos in late 2023 / early 2024. I love Havik. As a final boss for the expansion however?  yeah disappointing.
2. DEI infested things littered everywhere. Unnecessary pandering detected. Especially Khaos skins. Unnecessary pink and green hair. Oh god. 
3. Invasions is just a grind. MK11 Konquest (Shang's Island) was MUCH better than this - and it had more easter eggs and things to explore. Invasions - why am I doing this when most of it should be done by an AI bot. I AM NOT AN AI BOT.

There are definitely positives, game is well balanced now, graphics are amazing, roster is good, finishers are imaginative, FLOYD was amazing, OG Sub Zero back as Noob!? YES!  

But as an OG MK fan from the start... 

ugh.     

Can Mr Liu Kang please use the hourglass and reset Netherrealm back to its glory days when they didnt have to pander to DEI or to an overbearing publisher that forces microtransactions and gambling for content, and actually make something us OG fans want?   You didn't need to gender swap Sektor and Cyrax. WHY.  Old MK2 Sub Zero is now Scorpion? and he's married to Harumi?!  WHAT IS GOING ON!?

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",True,2,1565

Unfortunately, the gameplay and designs are the only things I like about it. MK not having real lobbies is still kinda nuts. The story is not good, and feels like it was just a leftover focus-group curated afterthought from the era of ""MCU Multiverse"" junk, changes made to certain characters didn't effect them very much narratively and feel like they were made simply to drum up conversation (If you wanna make the LK Cyborgs women, that's tight, but why not bring up the sexism that was alluded to by Noob Saibot back in 11? The setup and payoff is right in front of you).

Invasions suck, how is it that SF got a konquest mode before MK ever got theirs back? The latest Kombat Pack is incredibly fucked up. Crossovers are cool, but MK fans not getting MK characters is extra wack. Too many people have discussed the cash shop, so I won't do it here.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,189179489,"First of all: This is my first review ever. Also its my first  time  playing any MK game.
I bought the game so me and my gf could play a split screen game. I like the game it self and its  mechanichs so far. There is a lot  to learn and every character is a little bit individual. Story is also  nice to play. Also i play  keyboard vs her controller. I also like that it features story ""unrelated"" characters such as  omni man etc... 
Now to the 2,3 thing i did not like:
First some characters as the ""main villain"" (forgot his name) are NOT in the  base game?(You gotta buy extra) I mean,  I dont rly care ab it but  i play other video games aswell and ik that if i rly like a game and suddenly such a ""big"" character of the game is ""missing"" i would be a lil pissed, not  in this case tho  bc i dont played the other  parts or am a follower of the game... but  for fans , this must suck.
2. I am german but ofc  i  obv speak english. Too bad  that my gf does NOT speak english so well and my game is turned on in german. And i dont know which  GENIUS  GIGABRAIN  came to the conclusion to make the german text as  FAULTY and UNREADABLE  as possible. My beautiful language got BUTCHERED into pieces. ""Fighter"" in german would be ""Kämpfer"" or the female version ""Kämpferin"" but NO, some brainwashed fishhead decided to write ""Kämpfer:in"" and THAT in EVERY SINGLE: MENU, TUTORIAL and LOADING SCREEN. My eyes started puking from this and when i saw  the  longer version ""Kämpfer:innen"" pressed THREE TIMES into 2 sentences, i started to feel the cancer  cells spreading from my eyes into the rest of my body. MK really pulled a brutality on the german language  and their players. If you want ""gender neutral blblabla "" language just  say ""Charakter"". I just wanted to  play a 2d 1v1 game and not a forced  political agenda. Atleast give us normal minded players the  option to turn that bs off but NO... ofc not.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,188981817,"So I have played enough single player (only one online match and I got my butt kicked instantly) to get a general idea of how this game feels. My feelings on this game is a mixed bag and makes me wish that Steam would put a ""Maybe"" option for recommendation.

I have been following Mortal Kombat since the release of the Sega Genesis port of the first game (I was 7 at the time and clearly not the age to be playing the game. Thankfully, I didn't know the Blood Code and the Fatalities.). It was the very first fighting game I have ever played. So for a long time, it was tradition for me to play the next main entry in the series (I played the two spin-off titles and avoided any future ones because of how bad they were, however, I do hear good things about Shaolin Monks so I will try that sometime.) The story and lore of these titles kept me playing all of them (not counting Vs. DC Universe as that was a stupid idea to begin with).

Sadly, starting with MK 11 (which is my least favorite in the franchise), a lot of bad corporate decisions showed up in the series and I was starting to lose interest in the franchise. The 2010s trilogy (MK 2011 [no longer available by the way. Thanks WB], MK X and MK11) had good fighting mechanics and excellent guest characters. However, because of my disappointment with MK11, I thought maybe I should avoid the next entry. At some point, I saw a sale on this game along with the Khaos Reigns DLC and thought to myself why not get it.

Okay, so do I think that this game is better than MK11? Yes. Do I think it's the best in the franchise? No. MK 1 has some good and bad things in it.

Let's start with the good. The character roster is way better than MK 11. I was happy to see characters like Reptile, Quan Chi and Ermac again because they were missing in MK 11. While I like characters like Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Noob Saibot, Baraka, Mileena, Sheeva, Sindel, Shang Tsung, and the guest DLC characters; the rest of the roster was kind of weak. I do like the story in this game and made me interested in playing it all the way through. The fighting mechanics are about the same as the 2010s trilogy so not much has changed.

Now for the bad. Oh Boy! The Bad. Like MK 11, MK 1 has the nasty greedy microtransactions that WB Games (who recently shut down Monolith Productions, creators of Blood, Condemned, and FEAR; at the time of this review. RIP Monolith), who has been persistant on encorporating them in every game they have under their catalog. Some of the character roster doesn't seem to be very diverse, which leads me to my next big gripe with this title: Kameo characters. Why is this here? Why can't I just play as these characters (well, maybe not Motaro as he looks tough to program as a fighter) instead of taking a page not only out of Marvel vs Capcom 1, but reminding me of the awful PS1 ports of X-Men vs SF, MSH, vs SF, and the aformentioned Marvel vs Capcom. I mean seriously, why aren't Jax, Sonya and Kano playable characters? I know I didn't play the Aftermath portion of MK 11, but really? Why not just have a Single 1 vs 1 or Tag Team like in MK 2011? I'm not going to mention the DLC guest characters as I know only half of that roster (I never seen The Boys, Invincible, or anything that Peace Maker is in, so I am not familiar with the characters) Oh Yeah, where are the stage fatalities?

A big problem with the game has to be Invasions mode and the amount of grinding to just get a character's 2nd fatality. I put in 41 hours into the game so far and only unlocked 6 characters' 2nd fatality. It's a slog to get through. As for Invasions mode, it's just a bunch of fights and other challenges on a board game-like map. One thing I can't stand about this mode is the fact that I can't control the camera at times when I need to. The camera always faces a specific direction depending on where the character is at. I also hate the clues that the game gives to you when a certain area is locked until you solve said clue. I solved one as Reptile using a specific fatality that the clue required.

Overall, while there's more good and bad, I can only type in so much. In conclusion, I feel that the franchise needs to be in the hand of a different publisher who hasn't had a nasty track record in recent years. WB Games has the rights to everything Midway made and they need to sell them to somebody else. One who can sell DLC, but not be aggressive about microtransations.

I have one last question in the end of this review:

Game performance and load times are far worse, an the game feels obnoxiously unoptimized at times, despite merely having marginally (barely even noticeably) better graphics than MK11. The character interactions at the beginning of each match were downgraded from the last game, and the overall aesthetic of the game hardly even feels like Mortal Kombat. 

You could spend hundreds of hours playing MK11 because you had all sorts of things to work towards like getting new gear, cosmetics, intros, outros, and all sorts of other things to customize. MK1 took all of that away and stripped it down its bare bones. 

Mortal Kombat fans waited an inordinate amount of time  between MK11 and MK1 hoping it would be even more groundbreaking than the last game, and instead what fans got was a game with less flair, less identity, and arguably even less content than MK9 from 2011. 1 step forward 10 steps back.

if you're mainly into the mechanics, you might not be disappointed tbh, but growing up with MK since the sega genesis days, it was all about the aesthetics, crazy character design and fatalities. 
the character design and story is something straight out of leftist blue haired ideology school, some characters look awful and the story is laughably bad, its a ""girl boss"" era of MK, outer world is ruled by women, all the the guards are black women and it's a mirror image of Earth NY apparanlty lol, with all POC's mixed in there.

The characters are well-written, and the narrative is packed with twists, betrayals, and epic moments. The gameplay is fast-paced and brutal, with a perfect balance of accessibility for casual players and depth for competitive fighters.

The roster features a mix of classic fighters and new faces, each with unique moves and fatalities that are as creative as they are gruesome. The Kameo Fighter system adds a new layer of strategy, allowing you to call in assists during battles.

The visuals are stunning, with detailed character models, fluid animations, and over-the-top gore that stays true to the series’ signature style. The sound design, from bone-crunching hits to the iconic ""Finish Him!"" call, is top-notch.

Pros:

Revamped Story: A fresh take on the Mortal Kombat lore with cinematic flair.

Refined Gameplay: Accessible yet deep combat mechanics.

Stunning Visuals: Jaw-dropping graphics and brutal fatalities.

Cons:

Steep Learning Curve: Mastering combos and mechanics can be challenging.

Limited Single-Player Content: Outside of the story mode, options are somewhat limited.

Microtransactions: Some cosmetic items are locked behind additional purchases.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,188147699,"[h1]A True Knockout and Return to Formula [/h1]
 – Mortal Kombat 1 is a shining example of how to completely reinvigorate a franchise.  More importantly, MK1 nails the trifecta that makes a fighting game enjoyable for me;  Graphics, Sound, Presentation/UI. 
I’m 42. I was just a kid when Mortal Kombat came out. It wasn’t until MKII that the series really grabbed my interest, and awe.  It wasn’t the gameplay, or gore however.  Sights and sounds had a bigger impact on me.  If a game looked or sounded like crap, I wouldn’t touch it.  MKII had hugely improved visuals, a new art direction – more dark and sinister – and massively improved sound quality, full of big impacts, effects, and over-the-top grunts and groans. (nothing has changed by the way. More on that later).  The groans were ridiculous. I loved it.  Every arcade I went to always had MKII turned up, and the above reasons are exactly why. It just sounded cool as hell.  The ports were mostly abysmal relative to the arcade version. Call me a purist I guess. 
MK3’s gameplay on the other hand did have an impact on me. I’ll never forget the first time I saw someone juggling with the secret unlockable “smoke” character.  Combos lead me to learn the concept of juggle mechanics. But MK3’s visuals and sound also impressed me – again, arcade being the best way to play it.  But after this, my interest in the series pretty much died. I’d discovered Tekken on the playstation. I’d go on to play that series for the next 20+ years. 
Forward the clock 30 years, and here we are.  Mortal Kombat 1.  This is the most impressive game I’ve seen and heard in over a decade, possibly longer.  I’m a 42 year old gamer who’s been burned out for years by seeing his favorite game franchises go to the dumps. 
Let start simple; 
Graphics. Yes I’m that guy.  Wow me with the best visuals I’ve seen in years, and I miraculously manage to overlook many flaws.  This is in full swing I suspect, but I can’t be certain. MK1 looks so god damn good I don’t think I’ll ever not enjoy playing it.  Check that off the list. Aces.  Just to be transparent, I do also own the PS5 version, which I've sunk additional hours into. PC graphics get a little bogged down, but I run medium 1080p on a modest setup, and it's mostly smooth, so I think they've ironed out most of the issues that people mentioned shortly after launch. moving on... 
Sound – Nether Realms has always had, and continues to have, some of the best sound designers in the world. I know this because I am a sound designer – well, I was. I’ve moved on to a different career path, but I kept my ears.  While I mostly worked on synthesis for several companies, I know good sound design when I hear it.  MK1 has a cinematic atmosphere. The sounds might be straight out of a sample library “something something cinema impacts vol 12” or whatever. Irrelevant. What matters is how you use those sounds. Punching, kicking, dismembering, blasting, teleporting – every single sound in this game is satisfying, used to such good effect. I cannot say enough good things about the sound. Music is well-implemented, matches the vibe, and just overall very good. This is in stark contrast to Tekken 8, where by 3 seconds into the character select, I’m greeted with “OHH!- OHH!- OHH!-Oh! Oh!...FML. It really makes me want to punch someone in the face! The Irony here is they succeeded to some degree in getting me in the mood to fight! But…Getting me into the mood to fight in a video game is NOT the same as making me want to actually fight someone – In Tekken’s case, I’d punch the music/sound lead at Namco Bandai.  Kudos to Nether Realms for delivering the goods, as they always have.  
Presentation!!!! HOLY S***.  Mortal Kombat 1 won me over completely with this. For years, the experience of playing fighting games for long periods was always somewhat hampered and dragged down by obtuse navigation, repetitive and undeveloped music loops, tinks, tanks, and clicks of menu scrolling and selecting, and excessively long load times. MK1 has none of this bs. There’s no douche bag announcers saying “Get Ready for the next battle!” (Tekken 7) past-their-prime obnoxious announcers like Lenne Hardt  (Tekken 8) – seriously what the f*** were they smoking at namco hiring her.  No Cliché’ and idiotic symbolic phrases muttered before every match (GG Strive). It’s such a relief.  Mortal Kombat 1 sticks with what works. The deep, mean, pitch-altered James Earl Jones-esque announcer.  And the eerie and mystical Liu Kang to narrate the intro and parts of the story mode, with just the perfect amount of Asian accent to keep things feeling more overseas, and less American.  
With MK1’s presentation, everything moves along without getting bogged down.  There are basically no load times. The devs have figured out how to properly keep the show going without losing pace.  For anyone who hasn’t yet seen it, watch the intro, and see how it transitions into the main menu. Then select a simple match vs cpu; 2 figures emerge from the brush in front of you, while the camera slowly moves into a closer position, and the rest of the packed roster of characters materializes in the bottom half of the screen. It’s so sick.  This is how a PS5 game should be like. The menu is evolved, part of the whole experience.  The background behind them is a lake with rolling hills, a sparkling lake, mountains, and colorful Asian forests. Getting from the menu, to anywhere in this game feels natural and seamless. The big point I want to make is that this seamless menu and presentation overall  has a profound effect on my mood; I stay immersed, content with what I see and hear, and I want to stay. This is the only fighting game where I can freely navigate to the different modes without feeling annoyed, distracted, or frustrated.  
In all honesty I haven’t played the game long enough to give anyone a lot of feedback regarding how good the balance of the fight mechanics is.  I can tell there’s some “tiers”. I can tell there’s some characters that’ll juggle you until you’re dead. That’s ok. I came from playing Tekken for 20 years.  I know juggling can ruin a game. But even on Medium difficulty, the game seems to strike a perfect mix of tactical combat, and brutal punish combos from the CPU. I’m ok with this, because they’ve found a way to make the AI challenging without feeling cheap. Above all though, the devs of MK1 have put so much thought and effort into so many other aspects of the game, that I frankly I DGAF if it’s balanced or not. I hate online play, especially for fighting games. Give me a fighting game that plays to the strengths they’re typically known for.  Graphics! Sound Design! Slick presentation! 
All three of those = FUN!!!  MK1 delivers the goods.  Perfect for deep progression, or just local 1v1 with a buddy, or 1vCPU, It’s something you’d think a lot of games would succeed in doing, yet so many fighters in this generation have failed miserably, notably due to the little things that just make it a miserable experience. “Heaven… or Hell?” (GG Strive).  Neither. Earth Realm please! 
Massive props to the devs who made Mortal Kombat 1.  For the first time in a long time,  I feel like I’m playing a game that was designed with my generation in mind. We are video game OG’s. Nether Realms accomplished this by removing the bs that currently plagues the other franchises, and just delivers an incredible spectacle that I want to keep coming back to.",True,0,927

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,187854589,"EDIT: After playing MK1 some more, I can really see why it died. 

Basically, the game is really unfit for casual players. When you play online, almost every hit results in a combo. So unless you can spend a lot of time to learn all the strings, combo launchers, and kameo interactions, you're going to be getting juggled for 30-40% of your health every match, over and over and over again.

Also, many of the paid characters and kameos have extremely weird attacks and abilities that are very hard to read or react to (fighting against Ermac and Quanchi feels like fighting against bosses in some other game). And of course you can't go into practice mode to test them out and learn their attacks unless you cough up real $$$ to buy these characters. 

All of this makes the game super stressful and annoying to play online if you're a casual Andy. So it's no surprise to me that most players bailed early on. 

OLD REVIEW:
MK11 was better, but MK1 is still pretty fun if you enjoy online matches. Crossplay is amazing. I don't particularly like kameos, but they're alright.

Story-wise, this is easily the blandest MK. All of the characters were so much cooler in MK9 and MK11. Everything was Marvel-ized, like they want to make MK story more kid-friendly. Shao Kahn is just a dumb jobber now, Cyrax and Sector are ironmen (ironwomen?), Shang Tsung and Raiden are a massive downgrade compared to MK11, Mileena, Kitana & Sindel are very forgettable, etc. If you're in it for the story mode, it's really better to just watch it on youtube.",False,0,4671

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,187837196,"This game is an embarrassment to the franchise. I was so excited for this release after enjoying previous entries in the series but I ended up being severely disappointed. The story was terrible as well as the voice acting, the fatalities were lazy (look at these new animalities for example), and the skins were horribly ugly. As a female gamer I hated the designs for the female characters. It was bad with the men too but they really went out of their way to make the girls look as ugly as possible. They need to bring back sexy to Mortal Kombat because women enjoy that too. The gameplay was extremely boring, especially so in invasions where your progress is reset in every season just so you can go through the same maps again to receive more lazily designed excuses for skins and other cosmetic items. The Krypt was not added to the game so now you are stuck with a half-assed shrine instead where you spend 1k koins each time to receive a randomized reward with no completion tracker so you don't even know what's left to get from the shrine. They've turned this game into a live service game so getting everything 100% is impossible and a waste of your time. If you are an achievement completionist avoid this game, because one of the achievements is locked behind a boss battle that appears once in every season of invasions (which lasts for roughly 6 weeks or so) for only 3 days and they don't announce it anywhere on their social media to try to get you to sink all of your time into this garbage. Getting all of the achievements for this game was a slog and was the worst experience I've ever had playing a game. This game isn't even worth it on sale.

I can't say anything about the story because I haven't played it. I wanted to, since I played MK11’s story, but as I mentioned, I eventually got bored and lost interest.

I hate the intros in this game—some of them are cringe-worthy (a big downgrade from MK11). I also dislike the Kameos and the fact that I can't play as Jax or Kano, among others.

And seriously, why is this game 174.84GB? How? What went wrong? This game is bigger than Red Dead Redemption 2!

I don't even want to start talking about the greed in this game. I hate that I have to criticize it because I love Mortal Kombat. The MK franchise is special to me, but this game is just not fun, and the DLCs aren’t saving it.

If you like fighting games, please try Street Fighter 6 or just play the older MK games. If you really want to try this (maybe because of the DLCs), do yourself a favor and get it at a discount.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,186481319,"Unfortunately this game had great potential, but it was rushed out the door with nothing much to show for itself and is a greatly disappointing mess. I bought the Khaos Kollection edition (which I believe contains all content that has and will be made) for £19.99, average saving of £50+, and I still feel shortchanged.

My review in short: Do not buy this game UNLESS it is on sale in the future for £10 or less. It's got enough highs to keep you entertained, but the lows really do sour the experience.

As I have been a MK fan since the 1990s I feel I should give a more in depth review to others who might be in the same position as me:

GRAPHICS/ART DESIGN 5/5
Once again NRS smashes it out of the park, and I cannot fault how the game looks. The New Era looks exactly how it should, and the visual design of the characters and stages really pop. My only grievance is, given how similar the graphics are to MK11, that the facescans of the characters from 11 didn't carry over. Huge fan as always of the art direction. There was stuttering and drops in framerate, but I cannot speak to that being a problem with the game or my ageing rig.

MUSIC/SOUND 4/5
The musical scores really heighten the energy of both gameplay and cutscenes. The meaty SFX of the moves and the environmental sounds really pull you into the moment. However, some of the voice acting felt a little more hammed up/phoned in than previous titles. Megan Fox's performance was abysmal, her character's dialogue was easily the worst part of this already disappointing game.

GAMEPLAY 2/5
Off the bat the return of Fatal Blow is great, a much better system than the cheapening X-Ray moves from 9 and X. The pace of fights doesn't seem all that different to 11, although I am not a competitive player and may be less knowledgeable on mechanical details.
Cameo system adds a new element to kombat, giving players a greater choice of special moves and combos to execute. However, after playing for a short period of time it becomes clear this is a somewhat underbaked feature that only adds more bloat (now you have to remember the moves of all cameo characters to be able to counter effectively) seemingly at the expense of the main roster's movesets. The multitude of combos each character had seems to have scaled down, presumably to give the devs enough time to finish the Cameo characters.
Certain fatalities and Fatal Blows have been ported in from 11, and reuse of assets clearly demonstrates to me this title was rushed by the studio by publisher demands. Likewise the vast customisation options in 11 or even the larger array of skins in X seem to have been cut down for this game, with many characters lacking.
The Krypt was cut in favour of Invasions mode, which amounts to an overly simple boardgame with repetitive fights and frustrating opponents, all for little reward.
Microtransactions return with a vengeance in this game, not as in-depth with the Dark UX as MK11 but certainly tiresome to behold. Unsure what else to say about MTX when they're so ubiquitous now.
Finally the roster feels like a swing and a miss. It somewhat redeems many 3D era characters by giving them more interesting and rewarding movesets or stories, but I have mixed feelings about the included characters. However NRS has pushed the guest characters too far in my opinion, with many other reviews also wishing for a classic character's return in lieu of pandering to comic/TV/movie fans instead.

STORY 1/5
*PARTIAL SPOILERS BELOW*
Here I feel the greatest disappointment. The ending of MK11 provided a perfect setup to a soft reboot (which I'm not entirely sure the state of the setting around MKX warranted, but it at least managed to make it fun) and for the first half of the base game story it works really well.
The New Era characters really are sold to us and some end up being much more fleshed out than previous incarnations. I was quite enjoying seeing things play out in Liu Kang's New Era without the contrivances of time travel or alternate realities.
Unfortunately this more reasonably paced plot gets unstuck when the story decides it needs to return to the climax of MK11 and unleash multiple timelines, rendering all that characterisation utterly pointless and making me not care in the slightest about it anymore. For a small time where only two timelines are suggested to exist I was disappointed, but could buy into. Soon however, it all unravels into slop.
The Khaos Reigns expansion fares no better, with characters being plucked from random timelines and an even greater amount of confusion as to who's who and importantly confusion as to why I should care.
Given the really interesting and (for MK as a franchise at least) unique setup I was very disappointed. MK9 managed to handle rebooting in a really careful and well executed manner, and I'd have preferred to see something with that level of restraint. They took a swing and really missed, which is frustrating as it achieved a great first and second act.

OVERALL RATING 48/100

Give this one a miss.
If you are new to the franchise do not bother, despite signalling itself as a reboot this feels like a tired late instalment rather than a refresh. Try MKX or MK11 instead. If you are an existing MK fan, stick the games you already own.
I could only recommend this game if it drops below £5 at any point, maybe pick it up to breeze through the thin-on-the-ground content to tick it off your list then be on your way.

I just updated my solution:

Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Task Scheduler for MK12 Priority Management
1. Open Task Scheduler:
	* Press Win + R, type taskschd.msc, and press Enter.

2. Create a New Task:
	* In the Task Scheduler window, click on Create Task... in the Actions pane on the right.

3. General Tab:
	* Give your task a name, e.g., ""Run MK12 Priority Script at Startup"".
	* Ensure that the task is set to Run with highest privileges.
	* Choose Run whether user is logged on or not.

4. Configure Triggers:
	* Go to the Triggers tab.
	* Click on New... to create a new trigger.
	* In the Begin the task dropdown, select At startup.
	* Click OK to save the trigger.

5. Configure Actions:
	* Go to the Actions tab.
	* Click on New... to create a new action.
	* Select Start a program.
	* In the Program/script field, enter powershell.exe.
	* In the Add arguments (optional) field, enter the following command to run the PowerShell script: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File ""<YourGamePath>\SetMK12Priority.ps1""

For example, if your game is installed in C:\Games\Mortal Kombat 1, the command would be: -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File ""C:\Games\Mortal Kombat 1\SetMK12Priority.ps1""

6. Conditions Tab:
	* Uncheck Stop if the computer switches to battery power if you want the task to run on both AC and battery power.

7. Settings Tab:
	* Ensure that Allow task to be run on demand is checked.
	* Ensure If the task is already running, then the following rule applies: is set to Stop the existing instance.
	* Ensure If the task fails, restart every: is set to a short interval (e.g., 1 minute) and retry attempts are allowed.

8. Save the Task:
	* Click OK to save the task.
	* Enter your user account credentials to allow the task to run with administrative privileges if prompted.

By following these steps, you’ll ensure that the task starts at system startup, keeps running, and manages the MK12 process priorities automatically. This method offers a robust and reliable solution.

Story is bland. When u finish the first part story you receive an achievement that is titled ""What just Happened?"" rofl.

Krypt is gone. Another L, it is basically replaced by INVASION, but now you just have to fight for your rewards and chests are rare.

No Jump scares. Something that made me love the series were the typical jump scares, especially in MK10 and MK11, now there are no jump scares, a cool idea would be if you get ambushed in Invasion you get jump scared by the character you are facing in combat.

Added Cyrax and Sektor fem versions instead of Cassie Cage or Jade. That's what we needed in life, a female version of Cyrax and Sektor, can't stop waiting for a Johnny Cage female version, oh wait...

Can't switch Fighters while in a Tower. (Towers of Time) because NetherRealm Studios knows how much I enjoy playing the same character over and over again instead of trying multiple characters to see whom fits me better.

I hate the whole KAMEO ideea. I might be biased but this is just a sad escuse to add more names to the game. Darrius, Kano, Jax, Kung Lao, Sonya and Goro all deserved to be in the game in my opinion.

MK1 has 22 playable characters and 12 dlc characters (35%)

So basically when u pay 60$ for the normal version you buy 65% of the game.
I wonder if the next MK will have 50% playable characters and 50% dlc characters.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,186167926,"Review Title: A Brutal Rebirth Worth Every Punch

Review:

Mortal Kombat 1 is a triumphant reboot that blends nostalgic brutality with modern finesse. From the moment the first fatality lands, it's clear this game is a visual powerhouse—the graphics are stunning, with crisp character models, dynamic lighting, and gorgeously grotesque environments that elevate every bone-crunching blow.

The new Kameo Fighter system adds a fresh layer of strategy, allowing for creative combo extensions and tactical assists that keep fights unpredictable and satisfying. While the gameplay feels slightly slower than MK11, it rewards precision and timing, making every victory feel earned.

Single-player content is robust, with a cinematic story mode and the inventive Invasions mode offering hours of solo fun. Customization options are deep and rewarding, though the absence of the Krypt is a minor letdown. Online features are still evolving, but the core experience is solid.

At $70, it’s a premium price—but if you’re patient, the game often goes on sale for up to 50–60% off, making it an even better deal. For fans of the franchise or fighting games in general, the value is absolutely there. This is not just a game; it’s a statement. Mortal Kombat is back, and it’s more vicious, vibrant, and victorious than ever.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,186154472,"Been playing fighting games since the beginning since I've been alive since the beginning of time. This is easily the best Mortal Kombat to date. It's missing a couple things I wish were there like bosses, stage fatalities, babalities, friendships and even character kustomization is a bit 'meh', but there's tons of gameplay and the actual fighting mechanics are really really fun and fluid this time around with much less restrictions on what strings can combo into what specials than MK11. 

My favorite Mortal Kombats have been 9 and X because they just had the funnest combo systems. Lots of variety and some really long ones with good practice. All the games before that were funny, but come on, MK2 tournaments were annoying. Games were hell to play. 11 felt to me very limited in what will work, making it repetitive and I lasted roughly 6 hours total. Bored Stiff. MK1, or 12, hits on all the sweet spots and the overall quality is pretty triple A while still running clean on my dated, yet uber, PC.",True,1,8190

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,186129198,"This is generally based on it's asking price, not a sale price, To be quite honest, I'd say it is worth it if you can get the entire bundle for under 40 USD Overall the game is solid, the fighting is fun, the moves are brutal, the combos can be awesome, and I can't recommend it enough if you are planning to play with friends. But my experience devolves to ONLY offline gameplay. I do not play these games online nor do I play any fighting game online unless I am going to play with friends or family, I don't play these games enough to become the very best like no one ever was, nor do I want to become a toxic FGC member.

My main issue lies with these issues: First and foremost The history of Netherrealm Studios and their constant greed, Microtransaction city, and it is mainly due to their success with MK Mobile, which I played maybe once and dropped cuz it got boring to me. But the idea that they would start selling fatality tokens, currency to buy outfits that you can earn in game but PURPOSEFULLY lock it behind you needing to play hours, days, months, and years of progress is disgusting to me too. Look at the greatest fighting game of all time TEKKEN 3, you can beat that game with different characters unlock them with each run you beat in the arcade. Even having access to modes like Tekken Force, and getting Tekken Ball after you put enough time into the game... which didn't take days, months, or years to obtain, and not a single dollar more than what you paid for the game. Season Passes are shitty, but unfortunately too many (""gamers"" *cough* pay pigs *cough*) have agreed that this is how fighting games need to be now. But then in this game, if you didn't pre-order the game you have to pay 8 USD for Shang Tsung... you know that character that you get to play as in the Story Mode? And who has been a playable character since MK2 to MK9. Even if you buy the fucking Khaos Edition Bundle, you still need to fish out 8 USD (plus tax btw) to get Shang Tsung on top of that, which I refuse to do so he is still sitting in the Character Select screen Locked, what's even more insulting is that I am UNLOCKING SKINS FOR HIM DESPITE HIM BEING LOCKED! Not to mention selling HOLIDAY FATALITIES?! Charging money for fatalities should be illegal. Hearing all this made me wait for the sale for this game, Although I assumed I'd get Shang Tsung anyway since when you bought MKXL you got Goro. (who was also a pre-order bonus by the way) 

And one big thing I have to bring up is Invasion Mode... HOLY SHIT is this an absolute fucking chore to go through, You don't think much of it at first, you are on a little map and have the camera behind your character in third person and you do fights to keep moving forward and you think ""Ohh this isn't so bad"" then you hit the realization... ""This... Is... Boring..."" Continuing forward with Invasion at least after about an hour or two of playing you fight boss type enemies depending on the season, Everyone else you have to beat them once and you can move forward, But these enemies, you have to beat once, then they get up and activate some bullshit abilities, mainly Armor and elemental attacks that they remain invunerable until they are finished with their crap. And they want to claim ""This adds difficulty."" No this adds to the ""I'm going to be as annoying as fucking possible"" factor more than difficulty, Difficulty adds a since of challenge, Like the computer being more alert to your attacks, using more combos to wittle your health away instead of just taking hits like a chump. Adding MORE health and more damage reduction to an enemy doesn't make them harder, and I hate that argument because so many people are just so brain dead that they think this equals difficulty, That'd be like in Dark Souls if you defeated one of the first easier bosses, it got back up and had a cutscene of it putting on massive armor then you defeat it again only this time it took you 10 minutes instead of about 3-5 minutes, and then AFTER THAT, it gets up again and hovers in the air and rains down an unholy amount of fire on your ass and if it kills you there, you gotta DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, Dark Souls can get difficult but their are definetly not bosses like I just described in that game. And the minigames... Ohh my god whoever designed these needs to be punched in the throat then fired, They start off innocently enough, ""Use cyrax's bomb to destroy blocks before time runs out"" ""Escort the creature on a roomba to the other side of the fighting stage while defending it against zombies (which are the easiest ones)"" ""Dodge elemental orbs until time runs out"" etc. But once you keep progressing farther... you get to some of the most difficult ones that could ever exist. They make you want to rip your hair out of your head. And oh of course they are ""Optional""... But not if you want 100% completion on the map itself Sonny Jim so YOU BETTER GO FUCKING DO IT, OR YOU AREN'T COMING INSIDE FOR DINNER TONIGHT! It is 110% a boring, undeniable, absolute, slow fucking chore. Fighting games are supposed to be fun, you are supposed to feel accomplished when you complete something like these. But it is just so pointless and so irritating.

All this game has going for it for Single Player, and Local Multiplayer, or Online with Friends is the Story Mode (Not part two, that one sucked my ass) The combat itself, and some of the customization... if you unlocked anything for your characters you like. But this game is 100% not worth it's asking price, you have so many better options to spend money on with gaming right now, Hell, CAPCOM released a big ass bundle of fighting games in one big collection Marvel vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics you could buy that and it's cheaper than MK1 and you'd get more dollar value there than you would here.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,185530703,"I'll warn in advance that this is going to be a long review.

Whenever I try out a new game in a franchise I always do my best to go into it with fresh expectations, and I did so with this game as well. However this time I was sorely disappointed. I'll start with what I do like about this game:

1. The fatalities/brutalities have definitely been stepped up a notch and I'm glad to see it.
2. The cinematics and graphics are fantastic.
3. While the control scheme is slightly different than it's predecessor MK11, it's a relatively easy thing to get used to.
4. Takeda, Quan Chi, and Reptile are all fantastic additions to the roster.

Now onto the things that I don't like. While the story mode itself is good, it just doesn't feel like it has the same amount of thought behind it as the MK11 campaign did. In fact just about everything about this game feels rushed. 

One of my main complaints about this game is probably more of a personal preference, but I'll say it anyway. The change to the art style and general character skin designs are just boring. They made it too simplistic. I don't like the new art style. The second thing that this game failed to deliver on for me is the kameo system. You rely way too heavily on it in fight, and it just makes it feel like you're not the one really fighting. And on a secondary note, with the addition of kameo characters we also lost things like custom intro/victory cutscenes that were unique to each character like we had in MK11. Instead every time you go into a fight it's the same damn cutscene. 

The third thing that I don't like about this game is the addition of characters like Homelander, Peacemaker, and Ghostface. It just feels like you're turning Mortal Kombat into a goofy superhero mashup game. Which is just not what Mortal Kombat is about. The fourth thing that was upsetting to see is how badly they paired down the character customization abilities. There's nowhere near as many skins or different gear pieces for each character than there were in MK11, making the game feel less personal and honestly less rewarding. In MK11 the reward for being really good and dedicating yourself to the game was gaining the ability to customize your favorite characters to your heart's content, even allowing up to 4 different variation slots per character. So in comparison to it's predecessor MK1 just isn't on the same level.

The last thing is more of a minor gripe but on top of everything else, it just pisses me off. The new menu UI is horrendously boring. In MK11, everything in the menu was stylized, well formatted, and it was interactive. It made just moving through the menu's to do things an enjoyable experience and it's something I miss in this game.

So in conclusion, while MK1 did some things right it also did a lot of things wrong. Maybe with the next game Netherrealm Studios will listen to their community.",False,1,128478
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,185497387,"This game hurt my right index finger.

In all seriousness, definitely a very good storytelling game, however there are a few plot holes and contradictions in the story. As for the gameplay, it is very fun to learn combos and get used to the characters, however there are a lot of balance issues when it comes to certain character's combos that you cannot escape from without a Combo Breaker because it never ends, such as Scorpion, Reiko, Liu Kang, Ghostface, Smoke, Johnny Cage, and Raiden. But other than that, the gameplay is fun. You will also encounter a lot of input delay due to how the game functions, but you will eventually get used to it. 7.5/10 for me in terms of gameplay.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,185386719,"Very dissapointing. Imo, Ed Boon is too stuck in the past, nostalgia is killing this game. I can only call this a half-hearted reboot that soullessly follows the trend of Marvel-esque multiverse stories, that although entertaining enough, keeps on digging the grave of whatever potential this franchise's lore had by never taking it too seriously.

As for the rest, it's a game that failed to learn from the mistakes of MK11 and even doubles down on some of them. The worse aspect in my opinion being the customization part of the game. Like, sure, the Krypt wasn't perfect, but Invasions is infinitely worse and padded in a way that seems to want to kill you from boredom. This game is monetized very heavily and honestly, the free stuff is a drag to get and not worth the hassle, with the exception of the grindiest stuff.

As for the towers of time, they don't seem to have changed as much at first glance, but after playing for a bit you notice how they have no sauce at all compared to the last game. The levels system and making the floors (minus the top one in some cases) one round encounters was not a great idea, not to mention, the loot is pretty boring most of the time.

The multiplayer is dead at this point. It takes ages to find matches and the Kombat League is basically unchanged and as flawed as ever. And don't get me started on the Kameo system or the DLC pricing.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,185041513,"Been a Mortal Kombat fan since the very first one in the 90's and used to go to the Arcade daily for MK3 as a teen. I've completed the campaign for MK1 and what started as a very promising game ended is such disappointment. Let's first talk about the good: 

- The core combat system is really great. It's extremely satisfying, as usual, to complete combos and fatalities. 
- Graphics are crisp, fluid and optimized. The environments are rich in detail and really impressive. 
- It runs great on handhelds. I also played this on my ROG Ally X and it was a treat. 

The bad: 

- Everything seems locked, even after completing the campaign, behind some sort of microtransaction, paywall, or a LOT of grinding. This is a massive let down for me. I've played 10 hours of this game and I stil cannot access almost anything, apart from maybe a couple different skins for characters. This is after already paying $60 for this game. You pay that much.. and you're still faced with a half-game, where the rest is locked behind a paywall, or incessant grinding. Shame on you developers. I will never support another MK like this. 

- The story goes from ""pretty damn good"" to ""wtf just happened"". I mean literally, even one of the last achievements is called ""What just happened??"". The end of the first campaign is an absolute sh*t show. And right after you complete it, you're slapped with another paywall to continue the story further. LOL!

- The grind: In order to even get the juicy gear, skins and other interesting stuff, you have to complete ""invasions"" mode, which is truly a boring grind.

Pros: 
Kameo system is fun and love the characters choose for them
Combat feels different, more focused with no scenary elements or variations, just you and the kameo moves
Story mode is better IMO that previous games, specially 11
Don´t feel to grindy comparing previous game
Some new designs from characters, music, scenaries are top notch and different
Most important, feels like a proper reboot but still with old flavour

Cons:

Some new designs are too way different for everybody liking them
Kameo system plays like tag, so if you are used to previous games maybe you don´t like it
Live service and monetary stuff
Feels like a introduction to the new setting, for good and bad.
Technical issues like shaders preload and how they appear in game show the game was a bit rushed (game
doesn´t require SSD but it´s totally needed it for avoid stuttering)

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,184252943,"So the only similar game to this ive played is Injustice, which set my expectations of this game REALLY low. 

And at first it wasn't fun, i started off with the sand time guy and was getting my ass handed to me because i go for reads instead of combos and he had a lot of low range combo building attacks. But I still had a bit of fun. Then I started up the story.

I had no idea that I was basically in for a movie, all the first where REALLY easy (i played on normal difficulty), except for the final boss who killed me twice before i beat him. Other than that I didn't die except at one strength check when i wasnt looking. 

That being said, the fact the game was so easy only made it more apparent that in that 10 or so hours of story i played through, MOST OF IT WAS FREAKING CINEMATICS. And actually good ones too, This game is basically as much of a movie as lord of the rings, which in its own right is insanely impressive.

Its not easy to sell off a 10-20 hour game at 50$, but I think mortal kombat is an exception, i think its so incredibly fine tuned that it is indeed worth that exhorbitant amount of money.

Not only that, but im still enjoying it, i havent even played online yet but the seasonal events they release are incredibly fun, the skins you can earn look amazing, and even without those its still fun to try out all the different characters, and learn to fight with them.

The controls of mortal kombat are very smooth, and easier to pick up than injustice 2s controls, they also make a shit ton more sense. One of my favorite parts about them is many of the are universal, such as forward+back+x allowing for a ranged attack on most characters. 

My ONLY problem with this game is its too combo based, I haven't played online, but after fighting a few high difficulty bots (and losing), it becomes apparent that a single combo doing up to 500 damage after starting from a light or quick pull-out attack means your fucked after 2-4 hits. 

Other than that, amazing plot, great characters, super fun game mechanics, super easy to learn game mechanics, so much content to keep me engaged once i've beaten the game. Just all around well done Netherealm, you really knocked it out of the park on this one.",True,0,2702

Playing this game online is atrociously bad, It's very laggy no matter how good the connection is between you and the opponent. There are lots of bugs with this game when you play online.

This game needs more stability patches when it comes to the online.

Oh and not to mention the Invasion mode is hot garbage, Ambushes are annoying and the whole mode is just repetitive fight after fight. Test your might for some reason has Test your strike bars which is already puzzling enough. And avoiding projectiles for a mode is lame.

Not to mention single handed kombos are utterly flushed out because you need to depend on using your kameo to keep continuing it which is dumb.

Only good things about this game is the returning/guest characters in the game. Other than that, I wouldn't play this until they're done with the game entirely when it comes to online.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,183831182,"Ya'know. MK1 got so much crap early on, it kinda put me off...

But now that I've played it, it's become hands down my favorite form of MK to play.

Do I think some things could be improved? (Kameos having a weird call-in animation that you can SOMETIMES cancel but never feels consistent) Sure.

But do I think it's ""Trash"" or ""Dead""? God no. It's far and away better than MK11 in my eyes, and I'm sure that will get me some hate, but It's just my take. 

I played ""Ko-op"" through the entire campaign via parsec, as well as some of the towers and invasion mode, and had an absolute blast, and even alone, it's a game I've dumped 14 hours into over two days.

I will say, I'm not a ""ranked"" guy. I don't lab my ass off, and I don't try to go for the most optimal stuff every single game. I am however, no stranger to fighting games. I've played just about everything under the sun at least some, and am pretty consistently playing SOME sort of fighting game. I've chased the ranked dragon in multiple games, but MK just never was that kind of game for me. It's always been a ""with friends"" experience, and for that, it's been an amazing ride. I'd say I've more than got my money's worth out of the game and I've only just begun.

Maybe the hate comes from over-optimization in ranked, but that's never bothered me either way. FFS I play Eddy, Lidia and Lee Chaolan in Tekken 8. I'm not here to play top tier, I'm here to play the game, and for what MK1 is, it's a fantastic ""Pick up and play"" game.

My Ko-op partner had only briefly played one single session of MK11 for maybe....an hour at most? And he was kind of mixed on it. Now with MK1 he's already picking up character Archtypes really well, and making his own strategies around using characters compared to my own, which is really cool to see. There's a lot of freedom at the Low~Intermediate levels. I can't speak for high~Top level play, as I'm not garish or self-centered enough to put myself there (Or delusional.)

Out of the entire roster, there was only one or two characters that didn't immediately appeal to him, and he's no stranger to fighting games either, just mortal kombat. He was able to pick up and play within minutes, and go toe to toe with me who had been playing MK since I was 4 years old, which I think both speaks to the accessability of the game and his prior experience with fighting games (And just in general he's quite good, when he's not in his own head.)",True,0,1829
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,183829199,"I'll be honest, the game is surprisingly hard and unfun to play on online mode.

The gameplay is cool with bots and all the interactive voicelines too, but you'll most likely go to multiplayer since i did not pay that much of a price to play with NPCs in a multiplayer game. And this is where my love for the game goes down, not even in the first match i already started getting combo'ed without having the ability to break the combo at all, but even if i did do that they would just combo me in the corner again no matter how many keys i press. And additional info is that i was playing on a controller too. I literally couldn't win A SINGLE online match i played, there was one time where some random ass dude literally combo'ed me in the air for 5 and more seconds, and THAT WAS MY THIRD MATCH.

Now this may look like a ""skill issue"" whine but i am just complaining on how unwelcoming online is for casual players.

To conclude this, i am not saying that the game is bad, in fact, it's fun. But what irritates me is the multiplayer mode, which places me with players with a way skilled level than mine.",False,0,223

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,183738068,"its honestly a shame how amazing the character and environment artists did when creating this game. the characters have some of the best designs to date and the stages are breath taking. what really is the issue with mk1 is the lack of content and abandonment of the game after being promised it was going to be their most supported game just for WB to cut the chord of the game and start the next one because they got greedy. No KP3, Khaos reigns was awful, the rushed released with a ton issues and no krypt? The game play is one of my favourite in the series, that netherrealm really delivered on. Its a shame that the game was abandoned as i believe it had so much potential to do well if they just listened to the player and stopped charging so much money for fatalities and cosmetics. This game really fell short because this was WB's cash cow, there was no love or passion behind this game, just another project to pump out money. Games are starting to lose their purpose and its the corrupt companies behind the hardworking developers and artists really ruining it for everyone. If MK can get away from WB and find a different publisher, one that will actually give it the love it deserves,  then maybe it has a chance of redeeming itself, but as of right now, ive never seen such a criticised MK game in the 10 years ive been playing it. I also was NOT  a big fan of the selection of characters we got in KP2. So many other characters were requested, they had Jade, Sonya, Kano, Skarlet being requested and instead we got Conan and a bunch of awful guest characters who no one even wanted. The timeline BS needs to end in this game, im tired of hearing about timelines and dimensions, its getting old and unoriginal. Thats what MK1's story is missing, originality. We were promised that MK1  was not a continuation from MK11, but thats exactly what it was, a continuation from MK11. Its a beautiful game filled with empty promises which really breaks my heart as i love this series, but companies are getting corrupt and greedy and this will be the death of many more games to come.",False,1,11684

The 130GB download is ridiculous and I was worried because a lot of ported console games with bloated download sizes also run like garbage on my PC (looking at you Forza). Luckily MK1 runs smooth as butter with my 4060ti and i5-12400F.

After a few hours I am loving the gameplay although as a noob I'm obviously total garbage. The campaign is fun, and some of the early fights with simplified characters and move-sets has helped me learn quickly. Loving the amazing graphics and vibrant color palette.

This game has gotten mixed reviews on here, and as a noob to fighting games I can't speak to the finer details and mechanics/character balance, or how this game compares to previous mortal kombat games.

I think this is step down from mk11 since most of the characters have this intro before the fight which they talk to their opponent then fight, unlike in mk11 where you can choose your intro per characters which add more options for players especially if they have favourite characters. I tried different characters to play as and I must say they are pretty fun but sometimes they can be confusing especially when the when their list of movesets does not explain much how to pull of their special moves or combo or if there is requirement for those. I think there are easier and hardest character to play as. Some combos are hard to pull off since there is this specific window or timing that you must learn or pay attention to but they are very short of timing or window. Also character design on most character  are downgrade for me compared to mk11 or even street fighter 6 especially the female characters. That being said, it is not a bad game or anything but I wish they did better job for both long time fans and new players. I cannot speak for microtransaction but I heard they are pretty expensive.

This game has bizarre performance issues for being out as long as it has been.  Loading the game takes longer than I like, starting fights in invasion mode takes longer than I'd like, scrolling through characters in the menus even has an excessive loading time.  As far as the game play goes, it is no improvement on the previous game and in fact I feel has less content then previous games in trade of what I feel is a very lazy live service system that seems to be there to primarily sell you skins that you may have missed out on from said live service events.

I really liked MK1 at first. But then it seemed like it had non-stop updates every single time I went to play it, and not small ones either that would only take a few minutes. I stream my PC games to an arcade machine, that is how i play MK1. Mortal Kombat was meant to play on an arcade machine. The days when I want to quick just turn on my arcade and play MK1, i cant, because its got more updates to install and takes at least 30-60 minutes average. Then after the updates when the game finally starts it take another 10 minutes or so to ""recalibrate"", how annoying!!! And it's every single time there is an update. You waited an hour plus for the update to download & install. The game finally gets loaded and they make you wait more. Very rarely have I been able to boot it up and just play it. I HATE IT!!!

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,182057178,"I do recommend it, but with a few 'buts'.

It's fun! I think that is what's most important here, and the game looks great. Was really fun seeing a newly imagined story and roles for characters. Fighters feel distinct from each other, which is something NRS struggled with in the past in my opinion. I find myself really wanting to fire up the game and play, which is something I haven't felt since MK9. It's not all sunshine and roses, though.

However, the DLC and micro-transactions are wild. I bought the 'Khaos Reigns' edition on sale, thinking I was getting everything. I didn't. four or five kameos aren't playable still, and I cannot play as Shang Tsung, which is awful. He was a pre-order bonus, that i wasn't aware of. Even worse, he costs $10 CAD!! I know this isn't NRS doing, but rather Warner Brothers, but damn that is shameful. Bring back the Krypt!! Was so much fun unlocking everything with my hard earned koins, instead of paying for everything with a credit card or gambling my in game currency.

Secondly, the Kameo system is just odd. It feels clunky and takes away from the experience. Just a personal knitpick.

Lastly, performance issues on PC are still abundant. Make sure you install this to a SSD for best performance.

Sure! Here’s a draft of a review based on your feedback:

Mortal Kombat 1: A Thrilling Return to Pure, Unfiltered Chaos

After finishing the latest Mortal Kombat 1, I can confidently say this game is a wild, beautiful ride. From the moment you dive in, the graphics immediately grab your attention. The attention to detail is absolutely stunning—the character models are incredibly lifelike, the environments are rich and dynamic, and the brutal fatalities have never looked better. It’s clear that the developers have poured immense effort into pushing the visual boundaries of what Mortal Kombat can deliver. The blood, the sweat, the bone-crunching action—it all looks so vivid, it feels like you're stepping into a living nightmare... in the best way possible.

But more than just the visuals, this Mortal Kombat entry nails what it's all about—pure, unrestrained fantasy. The story pushes the limits of reality, as Mortal Kombat always does, blending absurdity and spectacle in ways that only a game like this can. It’s easy to get caught up in the nostalgia, and while there are callbacks to the past, this isn’t about clinging to history. It’s about embracing the insanity of the Mortal Kombat universe where, quite frankly, anything goes. The game doesn't ask for your suspension of disbelief—it demands it. And that’s exactly how it should be. The world of Mortal Kombat has never been a place for logic or realism; it's a playground for outrageous imagination, where anything and everything is possible.

What really shines through in this new iteration is the energy and chaos that make Mortal Kombat special. Every fight feels like a spectacle, every move has weight, and every finishing blow is as satisfying as ever. Whether you're a diehard fan or new to the series, Mortal Kombat 1 invites you to leave any cynicism at the door. This is a game that thrives on the craziness of its own existence, and it's all the better for it.

Mortal Kombat has always been about pushing boundaries, and this installment is no different. If you’ve ever enjoyed the series for its unapologetic over-the-top action, you’re going to love what this game delivers. So, let’s leave the past where it belongs and enjoy the chaos of today.

Lot's to get into but the main ""new"" aspect of the game: Kameo's. They offer a baseless slowness to the game, with most player you run into spamming some type of cross map kameo. Fight's get boring, and become much more of a cat and mouse fight.
I've grinded multiple seasons to the top rank, and enjoyed lot's of fights, but this rarely changes other than players playing more and more safe. Good fights are far a few between, with less combo's and more pokes and running, as the game encourages.

Lack of content, and bad content. The DLC Khaos Reigns was priced at $40, close to a full game and offered an extremely bad written ""multiverse"" story, and 3 fighters who are designed well but not worth $40 regardless. Combos are very minimal, more than MK11 but still a dumbed down version of anything previous like MK9 and MKX. Enemies fall out of the air too quick to combo after doing a chain, or a single combo and you arent able to extend it.

This is painfully obvious with the future DLC support being cancelled, and the player-base dropping.
Again, Tried my absolute best to love this game and defended it when I could but can't anymore and would never recommend it. The worst mortal kombat to date, and disappointing beyond measure.

If you are fond of MK Story, especially original timeline, and how story went up to Armageddon, then its first reset in MK9, and how events happened up to MK11 ending?
Don't buy this game for Story :). Literally garbage, and the worst so far.
If you want PVP: ping it always high due not tweaking their netcode, but still playable. Gameplay, combos are great.
I said MK11 is the last game I'd buy, then I did the mistake again.
If you want my honest opinion MK11 is far better, in character design, story, and gameplay
My rating 6/10

If you want to play story mode, yes you can get at on sale.
For Multiplayer it could be quite fun if you invest time, yet I had to refund it because its poor netcode my average ping is 30ms up to 70ms in all different various games, but in MK it's always above 120ms (Wired)
You can't select type of connectivity you are looking for, nor quality of connection which is the simplest feature that must be in every fighting game for example SFV & DBFZ you can select how many bars from any to 5 bars.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,181568683,I am a veteran Mortal Kombat player as I have played all Mortal Kombat Games for almost 30 years. I was a bit hesitant to buy this game due to the new mechanics and I wasnt really thrilled at MK11 small combo mechanics. I prefer a much longer combo system like the original Mortal Kombat games. Overall The story is new and fresh and feels pretty good compared to other games I was happy with it. The combos feel a little better than Mk11 which is nice. I still feel Sam and Dean Winchester would have been a great addition to this game since i think its Warner Bros. anyway... also with the tag system it just makes sense if they were going to put them in a Mk game this would be the one. Im not really that thrilled about all the superheros i like the darkness of mortal kombat games and darker characters. Even ares from Injustice i think would have been a better fit but thats my opinion im sure not everyone has the same one. The combos are are a learning curve and some i feel are still very difficult to pull off which is nice for the challenge but almost impossible in online gameplay for some. I also miss erron black so would have been nice to see Stryker at least get his own move set but i guess i can deal with a cameo.

ahhh well, I will never not recommend MK to anyone who wants a good fighter to play. 
Grown up with MK, so I have a nostalgic love for it, but majority of their games are great, even the side quests.
sadly the prices for some of these games and dlc's be wild, but gotten on sale so I did put my hours into this one to 100% it, plus was my first fighter on KBM.
I'll always love the lore they do with MK, even in the sense of it being rather similar in the reboots/redo's

for MK1 though... I did really miss the KRYPT. and having that hype for ""part 2"" of the story I was lowkey expecting a little more with that KHAO'S dlc, but regardless it's another decent story in the line of MK

Not to mention the storyline itself is so terrible, It doesn't even count as a mortal kombat game. The special attacks (the x-rays) are terrible and half the characters have the same one. Youre forced to have a ""kameo"", basically another character to sit there and really do not a whole lot. And the worst part about them? They involve themselves in your x-rays to ruin it.

This is not a good experience and disappointment towards the ""FUN FACTOR"" of Mortal Kombat 1 and will soon going out for publicity for my upcoming reviews.
Please don't make this experience become a negative effect ( which will include the full refund of what I paid only to be forever be in a sourfaced condition towards all Mortal Kombat games ) because I am a die- hard fan of Mortal Kombat game since the beginning way back in 1992 as an arcade game, and will only rip into small pieces the costume of scorpion, not to mention what would I say to your Mortal Kombat booth in the upcoming Fan Expo!
I am only asking to return my koins rightfully belong to me and allow me to purchase that specific epic Windbreaker with +42 Hit(s) of armor during Activation!  In my humble opinion, this is not so much to ask, but we must follow the rules of the game, and I am telling you, Steam directed me to contact you because they have no control on your server!

""Oh that's a disappointment!  I really do hope Mr. Tobias Boon could read this!
Please begin the refund process and I will notify Steam that I am not satisfied with my experience with Mortal Kombat 1 and I demand a full refund!
Enjoy the rest of your day Zephyr.

In addition to that, this is what I said to WB Games Support:
""OH and it was not an accidental purchase!  The game said an error has occurred!  The game won't let me purchase the talisman even though I tried to farm as quickly as possible in order to beat the time.  I followed the rules, WB Game Support does not buy what I said.""

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,181424286,"Good and fun game but next time you release a kombat pack give me all the fighters at the same time, don't make me wait months for them to drop.",True,0,1234
Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,181423399,"Incomplete and soon to be abandoned.

Let's start with the positives. Obviously this is the best looking Mortal Kombat game of the bunch, it looks stunning when things are working right and it really gives the feeling of a smooth flowing game. The characterization of (some) of the characters also adds a lot to them and makes them more memorable.

Now for the bad. This game basically released incomplete and even two years on it appears unfinished. Compared to MK11 there are

Fewer characters: MK11 released with 25 and ended with 37, while MK1 released with 23 and will be ending with 35. Removing third party characters leaves us with 32 and 29 respectively. MK1 also adds no new characters to the series.

Fewer customization options: MK11 featured 3 customizable item slots, a customizable skin slot, and the ability to change your characters special moves from a list or pick from a preset. MK1 now only features 1 item slot, the skin slot remains but on average has fewer/less diverse choices, and custom moves have been entirely done away with. Furthermore, MK11 showed you items you hadn't unlocked. MK1 no longer possesses this feature, and if it were active it would only reveal just how many items are now relegated to RNG from the shrine or in store purchases.

The krypt, crushing blows, and condition specific brutalities have been entirely done away with.

The kameo fighters system adds little to the game, at best it functions as the name implies, a cameo, while at worst it seems to be an excuse to reuse assets or barely pander to fans who have wanted certain characters to return. In the case of some of these characters, they've been unplayable since 2006. These characters replace one of your throws and half of your fatal blows are taken up by them, though they do have their own brutalities and fatalities that are at the very least deserving of mention. As a feature they can extend or start combos, act as ambushes, or set traps. However this relies on the kameo button which, as will be brought up, has a tendency to eat your inputs (even making a sound when activated) and then not doing anything.

Two years in and this game is horrifically optimized for PC. For context, my machine is capable of running Cyberpunk 2077 with maximum graphics settings and maintain a constant 60+fps. I had to use a third party application to set the best settings for MK1 because the default settings and the recommended ones provided by the game's own system were extremely laggy, sometimes taking multiple minutes to open up a single player match from the main menu and with the screen frequently artifacting. Even now after character intro lines I get to watch them have a staring contest for about 30 seconds before the fight actually starts, and these are in offline battles. Combo inputs are frequently eaten, they will even appear in the practice mode's input showcase without actually going through. This has made some character combos actually impossible (at least in my case) for a controller that is supposedly fully supported. (This is via wired connection on a controller that has little or no input lag in any other game).

I made the mistake of pre-ordering the premium edition of the game. Within days of release my game (a supposedly ""premium"" edition) was invalidated by the introduction of overpriced, exclusive, limited time skins and fatalities that were then quickly made no longer available for purchase again. A pumpkin head fatality was released and was going for 10-12 dollars, up to 24% the price of the base game's current cost. The team behind this didn't learn from it, and the Khaos Reigns expansion is now the same price as the base game. To no one's shock but the management apparently, selling what should be a 15 dollar dlc with 6 characters and a story add on for the price of a full game didn't sell well. As a result, there are several leaks and reveals that netherrealm studios will soon be dropping support of the game they said would be their longest supported service.

People were scammed, people were lied to. Many (me among them) have tried to get refunds for what is still 2 years on an unfinished and broken mess of a project that's all polish and no substance. 

(Oh and a note to the marketing team: selling a ""bundle"" that is theoretically cheaper than buying items individually and not allowing you to actually purchase one of said items on it's own is legally dubious and constitutes a scam. You might wanna get on that.)",False,1,3199

When I first saw the game, I was like? What is this?! The  character design, the concept, the weirdest  new design of Scorpion and sub-zero.

I bought the game a year after its release. First of all i had to change my mindest that this was completely different from previous Mortal Kombat games. After doing this and taking a new perspective  i was able to start playing it and I was able to form a relatively summary opinion.

The character designs are good, the story is good, the combat mechanics were strange at first but easy to get used to. I like that old characters were bought back. The character skills design are good and the combos are too. I think the Khaos Reigns DLC story turned out fantastic, compared to MK11 Aftermath, It's much more inventive.

BUT!

I think the price of the Khaos Reigns DLC is a bit high. The guest characters.... expect for Ghost face, I think they are unnecessary. The fact that Cyrax and Sektor became women was a bit strange at first and many people think this.

All in all. I think players need to completely distance themeselves from previous Mortal Kombat games and treat Mortal Kombat 1 as something completely new. if they succeed, it could be an enjoyable game for anyone.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,180952717,"### Review of Mortal Kombat 1

**Mortal Kombat 1** came as a pleasant surprise, proving that the series hasn’t lost its edge even after all these years. The developers managed to preserve the brutal dynamics fans love while introducing fresh features that make the game relevant for today’s audience.

**Gameplay** remains true to its roots: hardcore combat, spectacular combos, and bloody fatalities. At the same time, the new Kameo character system brings a fresh twist, allowing players to experiment with strategy. This innovation seamlessly fits into the overall style of the game without undermining its core principles.

**The story** is unexpectedly engaging. The reboot offers a fresh perspective on familiar characters while maintaining the signature drama and epic scale that Mortal Kombat is known for.

**Graphics** are impressive: every fight, arena, and character is meticulously detailed. Fatalities remain as inventive as ever, solidifying their status as the franchise's hallmark.

Minor drawbacks, such as a somewhat unfair monetization model in places, don’t detract from the overall enjoyment of the game.

### Score: 8.5/10

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,180695188,"Pros:
         - Best Base Roster since MK9
         - Kameos being a unique way to familiarize newer fans with more 3D & obscure characters
         - The return of Animality (Last seen in MK3)
         - Good Visuals/Graphics
         - Invasions Mode's mini games & arcade styled cinematics
         - Seasonal Fatalities
         - Air Kombat 

Cons: 
          - Megan Fox
          - Dominic Cianciolo is a terrible writer (Story-wise, franchise has been flopping since the MKX game)
          - Limited character customization
          - Overpriced DLC/Skins
          - Guest Characters shouldn't take up half a Kombat Pack, in a trend where fans are left to argue & debate which of their favorite characters should instead return for the other 3 DLC slots. 

Overall, I recommend MK1. The Kameo system is a bit odd at first glance, but ultimately feels like a universal variation system that helps keep you invested in your main fighter. Personally, the main thing NRS did right was finally listen to their 3D era fanbase.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,180390743,"The game has a lot of pros and cons, buy only if you are a fan of the series looking for a different gameplay and willing to look past the flaws it has.

I personally like this entry to the point I bought this game two times. Is it the best MK game? Not under many aspects, but gameplay wise it is definitely my favorite out of the 4 (or better yet, three since MK9 is no longer available) both to play casually and watch on a competitive level. 

Story: 6/10.

For being set in a new universe, a new timeline, a change for most of the characters origins story are expected so the devs tried to introduce new players to a new setting, however old fans like me might not like most of the characters backstories. Unfortunately, the story is also a rushed mess and most things just happen for the sake of it. There are some good things but unfortunately they don't hold a candle to all the flaws it has such as making some characters disappear for no reason at all or, in the case of the story expansion, do things that lead to nothing and finish with a massive plothole. I already forgot most things about the story, something that unfortunately even MK11 suffered from personally.

Graphics: 10/10

Simply beautiful, models look great. Not much to be said other than everything looking great, from the details of the stages to the likeness of the characters. I literally jumped when I saw Van Damme and Skeet Ulrich!

Gameplay 8-9/10

I am stuck between giving this game an 8 or a 9 because I genuinely enjoy it, however the Kameo mechanic is something not everyone likes and in this game, that is a core mechanic. If we were given a chance to play solo (possible with mods) or add tag team it would get a much higher vote.

Sound 9/10

The soundtrack is amazing, especially the Khaos Reigns stages which sorta give DOOM vibes, voice acting is great... Save for the voice acting of THAT character, but I hope mods will fix that in the future lol

Mods: 9/10

The game has a lot of support from the community since day 1, some mods are actually cool ranging from old school announcers, to skins for characters and kameos, Camera mods (my personal favorite) and many others. Definitely the main reason why I picked this game a second time

DLCs: 7/10

Unfortunately this is where MK1 sorta fails. I am giving it a 7 mainly because some characters are fun to play as but most either don't fit MK1's setting or they have been nerfed to the ground to the point not many play them.
First of all, my main complaint is about Kombat Pack 1, most specifically Quan Chi and Ermac: Are they cool? Absolutely. But do they deserve to be DLC? Absolutely not. They were in the story, they were fightable too, and worst of all, in the past someone leaked the select screen which included them both as part of the base roster, only to be used as a cash grab for a DLC pack. I think they shouldn't have been there. Takeda is the only exception to the rule where he is just great. Peacemaker turned from being strong to not being used by anyone, and this is also the game where Homelander bodies Omni-Man lol. The second pack has pretty interesting characters but honestly Ghostface is the only one that stands among them as well as Noob Saibot. 

Microtransactions: 3/10

This game has a lot of them, from crystals which are needed to buy skins, from skins themselves, announcers and gears for some characters, except that some may be deceiving as they sell stuff that can be unlocked in game if you're patient enough. The last straw was the Seasonal Fatalities which if I am not wrong costed around 1000 crystals or so, fortunately they didn't repeat that as of now, but that's just typical WB stuff.

Overall... I'd give the game an 8/10 because I genuinely enjoy it.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,180369157,"Not very happy with this game, story mode was fun while it lasted but as a casual player online servers are poor and invasions is unbalanced and full of slop. Aside from final boss rewards, skins/palettes/gear available in invasions store & earned in invasions mode also often look awful and aren't effective motivators to play. I have only ever reached the final boss twice and both times were a gruelling slog & hurt me psychologically. Reward skins look amazing but definitely not worth the time invested and i did not have fun doing it.

While this is one of the most visually gorgeous games i've ever played (when running on my pc), I prefer to game on steam deck where it eeks out maybe 35-40 fps tops with FSR on performance profile & lowest settings which looks blurry and a little bit plastic. MK11 performed much better on deck, while backgrounds are definitely less detailed than MK1, MK11 hits 60fps at (iirc, either high or i think) highest settings without upscaling, which hints that MK1 is poorly optimised.

This game is also a 100+ gb download and i haven't played it in a few months because it takes a full day to download. Keeping my system on all day during my day off just to download one game instead of playing anything is dumb as hell, and chokes the bandwidth for my whole household.

- The port is good
- I think the game is in a good state right now not perfect by any means, but you can use the majority of the cast thanks to the Kameo system of course.

Cons
- They need to add more moves and special moves.
-  Always so slow at fixing major flaws and very late to balance the game, even when the game has a big tournament coming they seems don't care at all. It is a trade mark for NRS laziness.
- Also always starts from scratch and no legacy moves, so there are no rewards for veteran players
- Missing some stable og characters
- The female character needs some work they're too skinny, like there are no thighs at all It's like a 12 years old girls. thanks to PC mods we are in good hands to fix that. I pity console players.
- They keep lying about the game's longevity and supporting it for years to come & we all know will never be the case same for 1-2 year window that's it.

They needs to build from this game onwards to add moves and keep the existing ones (just like Tekken). It is better for esports players and makes the game a more global game for other fella fighting players.",True,1,47777

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,179782343,"Mortal Kombat 1 reboots the series, offering nostalgic experiences for longtime fans while introducing modern mechanics to attract new players. The visuals are stunning, with detailed character models and environment designs. The dynamic combat and the grandeur of the Fatality animations make the series more impressive than ever.
The gameplay retains the classic Mortal Kombat feel while adding variety through innovations like the Kameo Fighters system. These new mechanics enhance both strategy and fun. The story mode stands out with its cinematic narrative and fresh reimagining. However, as a Scorpion fan, I would have preferred Hanzo Hasashi to remain in the role instead of Kuai Liang. Hopefully, Hanzo and Rin will reunite in the next game.
Instead of the Invasions mode, bringing back the classic Krypt system from previous games would have made the experience more enjoyable. Mortal Kombat 11’s Krypt, in particular, was my favorite for its rewarding system and the chance to explore fighting arenas. Additionally, a nostalgic mini-game like Motor Kombat from Mortal Kombat: Armageddon would have been a fantastic addition to the game.

[h2]OVERVIEW:[/h2]
As someone new to the Mortal Kombat series, jumping into MK1 felt like the perfect gateway. The reboot not only welcomed me with open arms but also made me curious enough to catch up on the iconic legacy of the franchise. It’s clear this game was designed to bridge the gap between veterans and newcomers, and honestly, it does a phenomenal job.

[h2]THE BREAKDOWN:[/h2]

Graphics and Presentation:
MK1’s graphics are absolutely stunning. From the hyper-realistic character models to the intricately detailed arenas, it’s a visual treat. The lighting, particle effects, and sheer creativity in fatalities elevate the game’s cinematic feel.

Storyline and Reboot:
The story mode strikes a great balance between welcoming new players and winking at long-time fans. It’s a bold retelling of classic events, with a fresh spin that made it easy for me to connect with the characters—even if I didn’t know every detail of the original timeline.

Gameplay Mechanics:
This is where MK1 truly shines. The combat system feels tight and rewarding. As a newcomer, I appreciated how intuitive the controls are, but I can see how veterans would love mastering advanced combos. The addition of Kameo Fighters brings an extra layer of strategy, keeping the gameplay dynamic.

Multiplayer Experience:
Online matches are fast-paced and exhilarating. The competition is tough but rewarding, especially when you pull off a killer combo. Some lag issues pop up here and there, but overall, the experience is solid.

Replayability:
From unlocking Fatalities and cosmetics to mastering every character, the grind never feels repetitive. Add in multiplayer, arcade towers, and new DLCs on the horizon, and MK1 has plenty to keep players coming back for more.

[h2]FINAL THOUGHTS:[/h2]
Mortal Kombat 1 has been an incredible introduction to the franchise for me. The rebooted story gave me a chance to jump in without feeling overwhelmed, and the gameplay is a perfect mix of approachable and challenging. Whether you’re an old-school fan or new like me, MK1 delivers a knockout experience.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,179613113,"This game is incredibly fun, I've found myself playing this game nonstop for hours before and I'm sure I will again, the characters and the gameplay are really entertaining, and the events keep me coming back to this game, but there are just too many issues for me to give it a positive rating as of now, some of the problems in this game just make it unbearable to play at times and honestly kill the vibe whenever I feel like playing. 

The main problem that most people have with this game, including myself, are the micro-transactions which are just waaaay too expensive. Like why do I gotta spend 30 real dollars to give sub-zero a different coloured shirt?

The optimisation on this game is also just awful, majority of the time I play this game it just runs terribly even when the graphics are on lower settings, even on some really good machines it will still run poorly.

And the main problem I have with this game is that every single update this game gets forces me to completely reinstall the entire game, it's not a problem with my computer nor is it a problem with steam. It just gets incredibly annoying to have to redownload over 100 GB of a game that runs like a powerpoint presentation.

If you're willing to put these issues aside and you want to play a good fighting game, I'd say give Mortal Kombat 1 a try, it is an amazing game but it just sucks that there are so many issues holding the ratings down.",False,186,2381

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,179599265,"the Kameo system is just...not balanced, 90% of the best kameos are locked behind a paywall and it's not fun to take 50% damage off getting clipped by a random low or overhead, cause at that point the game just becomes a snowball fest of who has the faster mixup and further reach and it's just annoying, the gameplay is slow and clunky, the kameo system makes it so there's usually 5 characters who are broken and then the rest of the roster is too terrible to win against them, and pretty much all of the soul of mk is removed from this game, the designs are boring, the stages save for a few are cookie cutter and also boring, the lore is too focused on realism, but also somehow time travel (two contradicting things btw) to be interesting so both story modes are poorly written snoozefests, this 70 DOLLAR GAME with a 50 DOLLAR DLC has a cash shop and paid currency which is the only way to get the actually GOOD and ICONIC designs, so now you have to throw upwards of 10 to 100 dollars if you're someone who for example loves all the MKDA skins because most skins save for the UMK3 ones are 10 dollars, iconic and beloved characters got either backseated or completely ignored entirely and not added period, or just outright bastardized (kuai liang being scorpion for example so now hanzo is basically a jobber, the beloved poster boy with years of lore and the most hardcore and die hard fanbase on the roster just got shelved and basically cucked by the guy who's supposed to be sub zero, let that sink in.) Liu Kang being ruined in lore and in gameplay, i mained liu kang since mk9 and i refuse to play him in this game because they made him so boring. basically all of mk's soul and identity just died with this game, all for the sake of that corny ass ""new era"" bs they're trying to push to us when nobody asked you to change this series in the first place because we loved it as is and we have for decades now, but it is what it is, another franchise i grew up with and loved being ruined by censorship, unnecessary rewrites and greed. it makes me so sad with this one though because my love for mk runs so deep i tried SO hard to force myself to like this game, but it's just not the series i once loved, i miss the old MK. Straight from the go MK. chop up the soul MK. set on his goals MK.

there's a lot that caused this game to suck, but to really break it down for you, i will now open up with point 1: the retcons and now turned awful lore

MK9 and MKX are simple to follow, the same cannot be said for the rest of the series, mk9 introduced multiverses into the story, yes, but this game and mk11 overdid it trying to follow that marvel hype and completely convoluted any sense of a story that Mortal Kombat had left, mk11 had you fight kronika, basically a glorified thanos for control over the realms and time itself, not only does she barely have a character so she's really uninteresting, but if that wasn't bad enough, you now have liu kang fighting dark liu kang while jax fights the future jax who is actually present jax and the jax fighting him is past jax (essentially mirrors between the same character, but apparently from different timeline where the only difference is everyone is dead and evil) and the whole ""ending"" of it gets thrown out the window for the aftermath dlc, which makes it even worse because the aftermath dlc in mk11 makes the rest of whatever lore mk had left even worse because sindel and shao kahn got retconned to be together thus completely rendering all the other lore she had useless all to force a corny romance plot in the middle of a crisis that could LITERALLY END THE UNIVERSE, but that's just mk11, that's the tip of the iceberg, mk1 releases and undoes everything that was already undone all for a ""new era"" thus throwing everything in mk11 out the window as well, kuai liang is now scorpion (literally why did anyone think turning hanzo into a jobber was a good idea?)  sub zero is back to being bi han, who is evil and only evil, he has no other personality traits, smoke is an errand boy now and sporting the worst design he's ever had, etc. but if you thought ""oh maybe they reset the timeline again to fix the lore issues introduced in mk11"" you would be wrong, mk1 throws i think the worst curveball i've ever seen in gaming by confirming that ALL the mk lore is canon because ALL the timelines are real, including the mk11 one we just painted over because mk11 kitana walks out of a portal to another universe to help liu kang at the end of the game, wow what a moment i sure hope this doesn't have dire consequences later.


now onto point 2: the story and  DLC

""Mortal Kombat 1 Khaos Reigns"" released and everyone was optimistic this update and dlc would save the game, little did they know it would be what killed it,  the story somehow gets even WORSE in the dlc, similar to how it did with aftermath, Khaos Reigns is all about making Havik so one dimensional i thought the only word he knew was ""khaos khaos khaos"" because that's all he ever says, no explaining of his plan, no deeper villain origin, just ""i hate all of you die"" and that's it. this dlc makes the timeline thing even more confusing, because apparently this is another evil timeline but not the same evil timeline from mk11, it's an even eviler timeline where nothing else happens but evil, that's it. the whole timeline is fanservice where you see different styles of different characters and different clones or combinations of characters, with absolutely zero substance outside of looking goofy and making every fight in the dlc boring because it's just clones of the same characters we've already fought, and then you get to the finale of the dlc, noob saibot is here, except it's less shocking because bi han was already so evil that basically nothing changed, but somehow they make him cooperate and together they all beat havik, the end, roll credits on a snoozefest with as much depth as a puddle, and then they ask you to buy EVEN MORE microtransactions after you just paid 50 dollars for the worst dlc in fgc history, congrats from Ed Boon, u just got fucking scammed.



now onto point 3: the design

mortal kombat peaked mk9 and mkx and then Netherrealm proceeded to never make games as good as those two again, another example of something i love being ruined by corporate greed and unnecessary changes, we now live in an era where street fighter and kof are more explicit than mk (in design obviously, they don't do the gore and all that) and mk's entire brand for 20 years was literally being as hyper-risque and hyper violent as humanly possible and now ed boon just got on twitter and said these designs were ""unrealistic"" but motherfuckers in mk1 liteally survive having their hearts ripped out in fatal blows and fight in heels, i'm not saying this was a requirement to make a good mk game, cause i know that's gonna make me sound crazy, but the difference here is even if these designs were a bit overboard/sexualized, they had FAR more personality than anything in mk11 or mk1, they don't have to have fan-service, just give them personality again, all these characters look too normal now in comparison to how cool they were, some characters who i wouldn't even call problematic (like jax) got his design ruined so bad he's basically a different guy every game, but they built a horror-risque aesthetic and then they essentially gentrified and ruined all the designs randomly and massively slowed down the gameplay and added multiverses into the story trying to appeal to a crowd that never liked or played mk in the first place, so now you shot yourselves in the foot because half your core fanbase is leaving and all the casuals had their fun with the game and are done with it now so you have nothing left, return this series to it's roots of being hyper explicit and unapologetic about it, that is what EVERYONE loves about this series before you ruined it, stop trying to make this series ""safe"" and ""realistic""",False,9,3023

The short.
For starters this game is overpriced. For the future Komplete edition, it better be 70 AT MOST for both stories and all characters unlocked with some stones to spend on cosmetics on top of that. If its all on sale and youre here for the nostalgia like me, go for it. The content just lacks here for me. And micro transactions really dropped the love even more for me...

The good!

The graphics and customization is great! I love the time you have to put in on a fighter to get pieces and make it your own style. Its a good move to reward hard work and time put in. The top player rewards is another great way to keep the community involved toward a goal of competition for all players. The story has a new direction which allows more diverse thoughts and ideas. But a little too familiar this time. I hope in the future, they look at Deception or Armageddon story and branch out some more. As a die hard fan. Of course they have my money every year to show my support since I appreciate the universe growing up with it.

The Bad (IMO)

Ive loved Mortal Kombat my entire life and have dedicated alot of my younger years to learning combos and loved the stories of Deception, and the idea of Armageddon. I explored every nook and cranny for hidden skins or fighters like the Noob/Smoke fight in deception. Here they have implied the most basic ideas from both and COMPLETELY disregarded the love that went into those games. The story of Shujinko really was unique. And this story felt completely reused, using the hourglass as an excuse to redo the tournament again. Nearly the same exact idea with Raiden's Amulet previously. I really want to pay for the Chaos Reigns but havent since I heard how short it really was with lack of content for the price.

 MK9 had the 2v2 fighter mode which TRUMPS over kameo's here. Fight me, the kameo idea is nowhere near as good. They could have added 2v2 online instead. Fight with your friend against 2 other players. 

All previous games had a Crypt and they completely removed it and got lazy. Making a bowl to melt your gold in. I miss the secrets, the easter eggs and the exploration. Whoever made the call to not put time in here is a bum. Yet another missed mark for exploration and dedication Netherrealm used to give the fans.

The servers for towers of time are terrible. I get removed to main menu after getting close to the top of a 7+ fight tower with hard modifiers and  it is extremely frustrating. Im not sure what to do about this...

 Im sure everyone is tired of the mention of Micro-Transactions. But all my mains were blocked behind a paywall this year. Characters that have been part of the universe for so long. Guest characters I understand, but characters in the story that already had a move set built like Quan Chi and Shang Sung is really low. Characters in the older mk9 were 2.99 ea. They doubled that price. Kinda allows Pay to Win with kameos too since Movado is probably has best support set that you have to pay to have an easier and higher win rate. Not complaining here, but most players wont have that access,

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

A lot of the playable roster is locked via expensive DLC such as the $30 Kombat pack or the hate crime that is known as the $50 Khaos Reigns DLC.

Servers are really unstable and every time you play you are confused if the enemy is lag switching or if the server is on 3 Jack Daniels.

Overall the game feels like the only thing you get that is $60 worth is the graphics while everything else feels like a $20 game or in some cases a free to play game with the insane DLC prices and $10 skins in the micro-transaction store.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,179128783,"I'm gonna give this game an true and honest review only based on my opinions on the game, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt. 

I can say that I enjoy playing this game. It has a decent balanced pace in matches where it's not all about speed and combos or just zoning. The game has some unique mechanics that make it stand out from other Mortal Kombat games like:

Up blocking: this mechanic allows you to gain a frame advantage if you block an over head with an up block, not a standard standing block.

Super jump/jump cancel: essentially if you punish your opponents attack with an upper cut you can cancel the upper cut's end lag with a jump allowing for combos.

Kameo assist: you get the option to choose an off hand character that acts as an assist that can allow for some pretty crazy plays or extend combos or add pressure in ways that the base fighter can't do on their own. Alot of people do complain about this system cause it kills the possiblity of some popular characters to return as full fledged fighters, but I think it's a nice since it gives some characters the opportunity to return wether or not they're lamped or standard fighter. 

The game also has its negatives like having alot of expensive micro transactions because.......Warner Bros. of course. And I also don't like the mechanic with the grabs where you have to guess between two buttons to count grab cause it changes depending on the type of grab. I think it's a stupid mechanic cause if you succeed in predicting a grab but you press the wrong button you're essentially getting punished for countering. 

The campaign was a bit disappointing to say the least. I expected more out of it and I was pretty sad to see how it ended up. The games secondary game mode is a bit boring and repetitive with little reward so there's no point in playing it. 

I'd say the game is not beginner friendly at all due to the somewhat complex play style and abundance of characters to learn and also the additional assist characters that add a whole new layer of complexity. The game can be buggy sometimes but otherwise it's a good looking game. 

Sadly, I dont recommend this game to someone who doesn't have the money to spend on it or has any formal experience in fighting games.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,178769875,"**Mortal Kombat 1 Review**

Mortal Kombat 1 delivers a fantastic experience that brilliantly builds on the legacy of its predecessors. The game takes everything fans loved about previous MK titles and dials it up, bringing a fresh spin to the brutal, visceral world of Mortal Kombat. From the graphics to the mechanics, it’s clear the developers have poured their hearts into capturing the intense energy MK is known for, while also introducing enough new elements to keep both longtime fans and newcomers hooked.

The fatalities in MK 1 are jaw-dropping, and they showcase some of the most creative, gory sequences the series has ever seen. They’re relentless, gruesome, and perfectly choreographed to keep players engaged and horrified in all the best ways. While another fatality or two would have been welcome to add more variety, the ones here are absolutely top-notch, pushing boundaries with every gruesome detail.

Overall, Mortal Kombat 1 is a *geektastic* game that captures the legacy of Mortal Kombat and drives it forward with passion and excitement. The fights are fluid, the fatalities are next-level gore, and the gameplay is refined and addictive. If you’re a fan of the franchise, this is a must-play—and if you’re new to MK, there’s no better place to jump in.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,178476852,"Mortal Kombat 1 Review: A Bold Return to the Roots with a New Twist

Mortal Kombat 1 brings the iconic franchise back to its roots while adding fresh and exciting elements to the formula. With its return to the beginning of the MK storyline, players experience a reimagined universe where beloved characters have new roles, alliances, and personalities. NetherRealm Studios has skillfully woven an alternate narrative that feels familiar yet refreshingly unpredictable, making it a must-play for fans and newcomers alike.

Story and Characters

The narrative reboot offers a fascinating reintroduction to iconic characters like Liu Kang, Raiden, Scorpion, and Sub-Zero, but with altered backgrounds and relationships. The plot is filled with twists that keep you engaged, with new alliances and rivalries changing the dynamics between these beloved characters. Liu Kang, now a god responsible for this new timeline, serves as a powerful central figure, guiding the player through a world that’s both nostalgic and unexpected.

Gameplay and Mechanics

The gameplay in Mortal Kombat 1 has been streamlined but remains brutal and deeply satisfying. Familiar mechanics such as combos, Fatalities, and brutal finishers are still there, yet the game introduces the new “Kameo” system, which lets you summon iconic characters to assist in battle, adding a layer of strategy. Kameo assists add exciting possibilities for chaining combos and give players more control over the pacing of the fight.

NetherRealm has also refined the controls to make moves feel smooth and responsive, making it approachable for new players while still offering depth for veterans. The game rewards skill, timing, and creativity with endless options for devastating combos and over-the-top special moves.

Visuals and Audio

Visually, Mortal Kombat 1 is stunning. The graphics are sharper than ever, with highly detailed character models, dynamic stages, and impressive lighting effects that bring the world to life. The gore and violence are still as intense as you’d expect, but the presentation is more polished, delivering one of the best-looking games in the franchise’s history.

The soundtrack and sound design complement the visuals perfectly. Punches, kicks, and Fatalities sound visceral, enhancing the immersive feel of the combat. Voice acting also stands out, bringing personality and depth to each character and grounding the outlandish storylines in believable emotions and motivations.

Modes and Replayability

Mortal Kombat 1 offers multiple game modes to keep players engaged, from the story mode to online multiplayer and the classic Towers. The addition of the Kameo system and the variety of characters also give players a reason to keep experimenting with different combinations, adding a layer of replayability that keeps the experience fresh.

The game does have a few minor setbacks, mainly in the online matchmaking, which could benefit from more robust options and faster load times. However, these issues don’t detract significantly from the overall experience.

Final Verdict

Mortal Kombat 1 is a triumphant return for the franchise, delivering an exciting reboot with enough fresh content to feel innovative without straying too far from its roots. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or a newcomer, Mortal Kombat 1 delivers intense, cinematic, and brutally fun gameplay that will keep you coming back for more. NetherRealm has managed to honor the legacy of Mortal Kombat while successfully forging a new path, making this a title that’s worthy of the franchise’s legendary name.

Not only that, but once you are done with the story the game feels very empty, Injustice 2 had tons to do with the guilds, multiverse and just cosmetic building with characters.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,178350692,"I'm a bit conflicted about this game.
I don't regret buying it (it IS a good game and was also on discount) but it has some flaws its' predecessor didn't.

I REALLY like some of the new stuff (the new takes on classic characters, letting you explore Johnny Cage's house, etc) and some of the stuff they brought back as well (mini-games and characters like Havik and Ermac).
A few other things are ok but nothing I would miss (characters like Reiko or Li Mei and basically the whole ""Invasions"" mode once you leave Cage's house).
The graphics have improved enough on a technical level that players going back to MK11 again should at least notice a difference (if you value graphics over gameplay, the newer game is superior).


However, the game's biggest problem (aside from its' price) is all the stuff they removed.

First of all, the customization is very limited compared to the last game. You can get new skins, but not choose special attacks and there's only one type of gear for each character.

I've gotten so used to mechanics like stage interactions and Mercy that it feels like missing a limb. Also, keeping the ""change stance"" button is a strange design choice, now that it has no practical use outside of certain mini-games.

The Kameo Fighter system is basically just tag-team assist without being able to switch to the other character. This gives you a whole additional roster of characters you can't actually play as.

The ""Invasions"" mode has you traversing the worlds in a board game style more similar to the map in Super Mario than MK11's Krypt, which gave you full freedom of movement.


And then there's the pricing...

The standard edition of the game has a story mode that takes a few hours and I heard the DLC (which is priced similar to a full-length game, even at a discount) is shorter. After playing the game 3 times or so, I've completed 38% of the achievements without even going for it. I don't see myself spending hours in Invasion mode the way I did in MK11's Krypt and just choosing a skin and a single piece of gear isn't the same as combining different skins, multiple gear and special attacks.

The fact that several DLC characters are present in locked form on the selection screen implies that this is not really the ""full"" game you're playing, yet it's not called ""MK1 light"" or anything (My title screen actually claims that I'm playing ""Khaos Reigns"", despite not having the DLC).

The fact that they recently started putting advertising for this game inside the previous game, along with the temporary discount, suggests that maybe they should have lowered the price to begin with, or included more content in the base game to justify the price.

Thoughts about the Kasual part of the game might be different from person to person.
But for me its enjoyable. I don't complain about it.
But online is disgusting. It's a pay to win game. Kameos change everything. The Characters that are released as dlc are always broken(there are exclusions). There is a definitely balance problem in this game. As a sub zero main, I can say that you have to spend more time in the game. A player that is obviously worse than you can win against you. If you wanna reach to the top. Learn the meta. Play the strongest. You don't have to be blind to not see these because Mk1 not being in EVO 2025 shows us that this game has problems.

That devs are atoning a bit and giving out more of a complete game for free if you've already got the khaos reigns pass is neat, and a step in a good direction.

All the extra features and gimmicks beyond campaign and arcade modes are not welcome -- and also don't make sense to me given the title ""Mortal Kombat 1"" suggests a return to form. I'm not sure if it's paywalled or progression limited or what -- but only 1 fatality per fighter along with an animality that often seems to have nothing to do with the character is not acceptable. I want 3 fatalities, a related animality, a friendship, and some variations in the brutalities out of the box. 

Unlike other reviewers I thought the campaign was fun an engaging. I find it odd that finishing moves are never available in the story, but that's not a big deal. The tutorial and variations are great. 

So many odd choices. What's up with the mansion? That's a half-baked mode. Why are all these weird progression RPG elements (talisman, upgrades, skins, etc) even here?

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,178269645,"this seems to me to be a pretty big improvement on MK11 (which felt horrible to play after the lightning quick genius of MKX). so that's a great start, but unless there's a *radical* shakeup in the way these giant brands do business with us the consumer, this is still just improvements on a dying boat. lemme tell you how this one sank to new lows for me.

I've got this sort of gaming OCD about notification about new content. these new games keep dropping with hundreds and hundreds of small cosmetics to unlock, and this one's especially bold in how annoying its notification is -- it's a big yellow golden* mark, just like that. it seems that size to the main menu lettering, the notification that you've got some unseen unlocks. and this is all for a reason, this sort of thing doesn't happen by accident.

I unlocked some new scarf or pair of shoelaces or whatever for a character I don't own (and don't plan on ever owning), and I wanted to just get rid* of the notification* that there was unseen crap to be seen and then forgotten about. so I tried to access the character's cosmetic menu (you have to do each one per character select - it's obnoxious as HELL), only it's not a character SELECT for a character you don't own, it changes to Character PURCHASE. takes you straight to a loading online link to buy their overpriced, likely AI-voiced characters. so I can't seem to GET AT the character or its kosmetics unless I buy it. so I've got* a notification* symbol always on my main* menu* that I can't turn off ... until I buy the character. the menu is designed to wreck havoc on itself untill you buy everything they tell you to.

this is bad, bad business. I know they think they're smrt, I know they think they've got it solved, but they haven't. the common, casual dialogue on MTX had turned from annoyed into nearly revolutionary by 2023. and they're planning on trying to wring the last couple thousand bucks they can out of this whole embarrassing shambles. their Mortal Kombat franchise has had its sales cut into a fraction of what it used to sell. I wonder why that is?

just one more thing and then I'll go play MKX or something and scrub this from my brain if I can. (gameplay is much improved, but what does that matter when playing the thing makes you want to take an acid bath afterwards to get the WB stink off? what's it all worth, all this greedy filth?) so they've got their own Street Fighter lame MTX Fighter Koin system, where the stuff you do just casually in game nets you koins for a sort of slot machine to RNG your way to cosmetiks you'd actually use, and I 'cashed' 5,000 of those for a pair of hand wraps and some kosmetik I kouldn't use bekause it's for a karacter I don't own. THAT'S what we're dealing with - you have a strong RNG chance on earning gear you can't even use. unless you buy their overpriced character DLC.

it's just ... buck this. why do they DO this to themselves? seems to me AAA Gaming was doing amazingly well for a decade or so there - from PS2 until the end of PS4. and during that time I guess they found out  they COULD get away with Ubisoft's taktics, they COULD stooge their costumer and they'd keep coming back. well now they don't seem to be doing that anymore, because the customers are realizing they don't NEED the AAA drip anymore. there are much more passionate developers making much more interesting games for either as much or even less money. and MK1, though I like it way better than MK11, is like the perfect storm of making the costumer, who always used to be right, feel like total spit just for buying the base game. 

if you've got a great tolerance for corporate backwash practices (or you're wealthy and can afford everything trhe game's gonna keep throwing at you until the next one comes out), I recommend this game. it's decent. it's not anywhere as good as SF6, but if you're into Mortal Kombat...? the gameplay on this one is better than I've seen people give it credit for. but seriously, probably just get X. that's the best one anyway. be well. we're getting there.",False,0,268

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE! It's an absolute ripoff and if you're one of those unlucky people that bought the $100+ edition when the game launched hoping you got everything, sucks to be you; you reap what you sow.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,178067201,"Mortal Kombat 1 is hands down the best fighting game I’ve ever played—and that’s coming from someone who used to think blocking was optional. I only got into it because my friend begged me. Like, full-on “please just try it once” energy. I didn’t even own the game, so he had to Remote Play me like I was some kind of digital freeloader in the laggy corner of the internet.

At first? I hated it. I don’t like Tekken. I don’t like Street Fighter. I barely even like tutorials. But something about MK1 just clicked—maybe it was the satisfying crunch of ribs shattering in slow motion. Maybe it was the blood. Maybe I’ve got unresolved issues. Who knows.

Now? I’m a full-blown MK disciple. I finished the main story like I was watching an epic action movie that someone handed me the remote for. I’ve become that guy—preaching Mortal Kombat to strangers at bus stops like, “Have you accepted Liu Kang as your Lord and Savior?”

The game is brutal, clean, and weirdly beautiful. The animations are crisp, the story is wild in the best way, and the fatalities are so dramatic they make Shakespeare look like a children's book. One minute you’re uppercutting a dude into space, the next you’re getting stabbed 47 times by someone with a glowing spine.

And let’s talk real: Pro tip—don’t get MK1 unless you’re grabbing the Khaos Reigns Kollection on sale. Because buying characters one by one at full price feels like you’re paying rent in Outworld. It’s pain. Emotional and financial.

My favorite part? The game turned me into a fighting game fan. Me. A guy who once lost to a CPU on Easy in Smash Bros. The pacing, the controls, the combos—it’s all super satisfying once you get into it. And when you land your first real Fatality? Oh man, it’s like your brain throws you a surprise party.

Update:
Okay, real talk—I don’t love this game like I used to. I kinda fell out with it after realizing I’ve learned every character, every ability, every trick in the book. At this point, it’s like being in a relationship where you know exactly how they’ll react to everything. The excitement? Gone. The mystery? Dead. The gameplay? Still good, but let’s just say the spark isn’t sparking anymore.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,177957659,"So, firstly, I will preface this with this will be an in-depth review of this game from someone who doesn't play it competitively. I'm a very casual player and only play online if it's with someone I'm already friends with. I really only play the single player Invasions mode. 

Speaking of, I've been playing the Invasions mode since season 2 and it has most definitely come a long way since then. They've improved upon it, trying to create new mini-games that are now optional which is fantastic. I'm not too big on all of them but thankfully you don't have to do them! I will say, when it comes to come of the mini-games, my game will just straight up crash. Sometimes I'll be able to play it once but if I try to retry if I fail it, I'll crash. That sucks and deters me from trying some of them, even when I'm interested in trying to complete it. Besides that, I really like the little type system for the characters. It's cute, but sometimes I wish there were more playable counters for some of the cast; it's not that big of deal, though. I'm really happy the developers made the decision to cut down on weaker color palette skins and made less skins that are really cool looking. Overall, Invasions is a lot better than how it used to be, but it could still get better.

The reason why I played this game in the first place is because of how good the game looked. As an artist, I absolutely adore all the work put into this game. The lighting and graphics of this game are unbelievable. Some of the shots or frames of characters just straight up look real. The art team did a phenomenal job with this game and I can tell the people working on it do care about it. Genuinely, all the artists involved with this game are so talented its insane. I have a camera mod because I love to go through the fatalities or character screens to get better closeups and the detail is insane. So much of this game is rendered and I can fully appreciate it with the camera mod. I can't get over the way the team was able to animate WRINKLES!!! How did they get the character models to squeeze and stretch like actual human skin?!?! UUUUGGH this game is so beautiful. With the mod, I'm able to look through each map environment and the detail makes me want to explode. I LOVE how pretty this game is I even love collecting the art work in this game and looking through the gallery here because it's all such great work. The story itself is fun but it feels a bit rushed towards the end, though that didn't really stop me from having a good time. Honestly, I could go on and on about how gorgeous this game is to me.

I feel like it's important to bring up the microtransactions this game suffers from. Now, I may be biased considering I was, unfortunately, hyperfixated on Overwatch and this game saved me from spending any more money on that godawful game. The microtransactions are not fun but they could by all means be worse. 5 dollars on a skin that comes with 5 other recolors doesn't sound that bad compared to 20 dollars for a skin on games like Overwatch or Fortnite or Valorant. The fact Shang Tsung has to be bought separately if you didn't preorder the game is scummy though. You even play as him in the story mode and he's treated as if he's not a DLC character, getting skins per season and having the same 35 levels as base game characters do. Also, 40 dollars for the DLC was crazy. Like, at first I hated it, but then I played through it and got a ton of cool skins (WWII Johnny <3<3<3) and the new character pack came with it so I didn't mind it as much. It's just......damn... my wallet...

To sum it up, I think the game is fun and very beautiful and I'm in love with Johnny Cage",True,6,25429

Overall Thoughts
Mortal Kombat 1 revitalizes the iconic franchise with stunning graphics and intense gameplay. The visuals are spectacular, showcasing detailed character models and vibrant arenas that enhance the overall experience.

The gameplay is very good, combining classic mechanics with new features that keep battles engaging. It’s easy to learn for newcomers, but offers depth for players looking to refine their skills. The audio complements the action with solid sound effects and a fitting soundtrack.

The story is well-crafted, taking players on a thrilling journey through the Mortal Kombat universe, complete with memorable characters and engaging narrative arcs. The game runs smoothly on fast PCs, with only minor bugs that don’t detract from the fun.

With an acceptable price for the amount of content—offering 20-30 hours for those seeking 100% completion—Mortal Kombat 1 is a must-play for fighting game enthusiasts. Overall, it earns a strong 9 out of 10 for its impressive visuals and captivating gameplay.",True,0,815

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,177752100,"Mortal Kombat 1 is an absolute blast, and I’m really impressed with how they’ve rebooted the series. Despite the usual money-grabbing practices we’ve come to expect from WB Games, the game itself is a standout experience.

The gameplay feels incredibly smooth and satisfying, blending classic Mortal Kombat mechanics with fresh updates that keep the action engaging. The graphics are stunning, with crisp detail and fluid animations that bring the brutal combat to life. The roster is filled with badass characters, and the variety of skins and other cosmetics adds a fun layer of personalization for players.

The story mode deserves a special mention—it's ridiculously fun and over-the-top in the best way, perfectly capturing the chaotic energy that fans love about the franchise.

On the technical side, the game performs excellently on my setup: a Ryzen 9 7950X paired with a 3080 Ti. It runs flawlessly with gorgeous visuals and smooth performance. I’ve also tested it on my Steam Deck, and I was pleasantly surprised. It looks and plays much better than the Mortal Kombat 11 Switch port (if you know, you know). While it doesn’t quite match the crispness of the PC version, the experience on Steam Deck is still solid, making it a great option for portable gaming.

Streaming the game from my PC to my Steam Deck and displaying it on a bigger TV via Ethernet has also been a fantastic experience—it runs beautifully and delivers the kind of smooth gameplay you’d expect from a high-end setup.

On one hand, it's an immensely fun fighter with great character variety, amazing visuals, fun combos, etc. All of that makes the game worth it imo... but the other shit makes me fucking despise this game with a firey passion. The overpriced DLC, I'm sorry to say, but I really, REALLY don't give a fuck if it's a new story expansion, $50 for the most mid story ever was criminal, the only reason why I bought it was cause of KP2 and the preorder skins for free. The kameo system, now I personally do like the kameo system, I think it adds a lot of combo potential with ALL characters and they ARE fun imo, but (for most of the game's life cycle), half the roster felt like they NEEDED kameos in order to make it out of F tier and the other half felt like they were ripped straight out of MKX without any fear in the world that they may need to use their kameo to help win the match. Gladly, they have seemed to fix this issue a bit, by making the characters better on the base roster, but it has taken WAY too long for it to be this way, it should've been near the beginning of the game, i.e. Season 1. The overpriced costumes, I fucking hate them. Gladly, we have a feature to earn dragon krystals now, but, FOR THE LONGEST FUCKING TIME, we were stuck with either leveling up characters with the XP bar moving slower than a fucking snail, or pay real money. Having $10 skins for a $70 game is criminal, but again, they fixed it now by making them... 5 bucks. I'm personally sick of the bad customization in the recent NRS games. It was great in IJ2, piss poor in MK11, and imo better in MK1, but the costumes THEMSELVES shouldn't ever reach the ball park of entering the double digits in terms of price. I keep bringing things up that WERE issues, but are NOW fixed, because I played the game day 1 on PS5, and had to wait for a year for the game to get ACTUALLY good, when it shouldn't have to be that way. WB, give NRS more time to develop their games so you mfs can earn more money for your coke parties and diddy brigades. Not giving your developers any time to make a game will mean it's rushed, which will make your product not worth playing, let alone buying. Now, I personally hope that this game doesn't get canceled, cause even through the ramblings of a mad man up there, I DO love MK1, but NRS just needs to be rid of WB so they can get back to making games without needing them to be out by THAT date or else.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,177489954,"Shalom brothers! Today, I would like to talk to you about why MK1 is  possibly the worst fighting game of all time...

Khapter 1: Mileena gyatt nerf

It has become apparent that they have nerfed the REAL successor to the outworld throne's gyatt... please... add the flesh pit Mileena skin from MK9!

Khapter 2: Kameos (with a k):

I absolutely despise the entire Kameo thing. It seems like another way to get us to pay for Janet Cage. Really, they should've added the freak off game instead of kameos as it would help disadvantaged players win a game of a set...

Khapter 3: Invasions

Due to recent political drama within my beautiful God-given lands, I would not like there to be any references to such 'invasions'. However, I do like this gamemode when my Palestinian neighbour stops playing after RQ when I play Noob Saibot all the time. They should rename 'invasions' to 'special military operations'.

Khapter 4: Noob Saibot

I know I kinda sound like a bit of a hypocrite, but Noob Saibot might be the biggest piece of shit since sadam Hussein threatened to use my throat as a toilet/urinal. Who knew Bi Han could be such a bitch not in life only, but in spirit? Really they need to remove boon tobias rn before my Palestinian neighbour pitches a fit and invites Hamas to our residential block.

Khapter 5: Lack of Jewish kharacters ($$$)

Really they should've added 'The Rabbi' which i suggested in an earlier Tumblr post. Honestly, MK11 is way more Jew-friendly with 'The Kollector', being able to play him was such a blast and I had great fun against my German roommate! (until he locked me in a room after spraying Raid insect spray, talk about history repeating itself...). Janet Cage could've been our Star of David in shining armor with how obvious that she is from Jerusalem...

Chapter 5: The ninjas:

WHY ARE THE NINJAS SO STUPID??? We all know that the ninjas are true followers of God. Onaga is a true representation of how Islam destabilises our little paradise in the Middle East. Therefore, Reptile should be removed!

Konclusion:

In konclusion, I hate the game, I hate everything, I have only written this review after I was destroyed by 10 Bi Hans in KL (as Noob Saibot, fuckin' bastards).

Overall, I felt MK1 delivers an amazing mix of nostalgia and innovation that will keep you hooked for hours. Highly recommended for any fighting game fan!

now that the game is no longer being supported, this is laughable for a new entry in this long running series. WB let this game rot in a closet because they weren't making bank selling skins. Wait for a steep sale for whatever komplete edition eventually comes out. Just go back to MK11.

The Game is now in a much better polished state and is definitely worth copping now compared to Launch. WB is smoking mad fent for charging 50$ for the new DLC however.

Let me state here that the tutorials for this game leave you SO much more confused than you would just watching someone play the game at a high level. They almost never indicate when you need to chain everything into one Kombo or if you need to dodge back and avoid or move forward first. They are the most Misleading part of learning this game i have done in my ( at the time of writing this, 42 hours of gameplay.) I have had a better time just running the character kombo trials and messing around in Practice mode than trying to complete the tutorial on the various  aspects of the game.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,176869408,"I want to start off by saying that the gameplay is good. I have generally have no complaints about that. I am the farthest thing away from being proficient in fighting games, but even without having that experience, I can tell this is quality. Or at least that it's better than MK11. All the characters feel easy to control, the combos are (relatively) simple to pull off, and I've genuinely had a good time playing it.

However, this is where my praise of the game begins to taper out. Because despite the fun I have had with this game, knowing what I know now, I would have saved my money and spent it elsewhere. This is a good game, do not forget that if you continue to read further, but understand that there are series things wrong about this game that you NEED to take into consideration before buying this. Like, oh i dunno, the fact that i got scammed. Literally.

I pre-ordered the Premium version of this game, it came around to about 110 USD. That's not the exact range, it's a ballpark. This was the most I have ever spent on a single game in my entire life. And what did I get for buying the pRiEmIuM eDiTiOn? Only one kombat pack. That's it. Every other Premium Edition of a game I have every bought has included all DLC. Now, you could say it was my fault for misinterpreting what was said on the promotional material and that i should have read the fine print and blah blah blah blah. And I'll give you that, I should have looked into it more. But at face value, it looked like they were including all of the DLCs with the Premium Version of the game. If they said it wasn't included, it was not easily visible. You might also notice something too. About how the version of the game that I am talking about is nowhere to be found. That is because they removed that version of the game, and posted a new version, that is 10-20 dollars cheaper. And it only includes Khaos Reigns and Kombat pack 2. It does not include Kombat pack 1.

And that's not where the complaints end either. Kombat pack 1 is not free from my ire either. Because it only contains 6 characters. (I'll get to the cameo system and it's characters, believe me) And exactly how long did it take them to release these characters? Within 4 months? 2 maybe? How about all at once, like how you'd expect a DLC pack to release it's content? Your wrong, whatever your answer was. Because we had to wait a year for 6 characters to be released. The only compliment I can extend to Netherrealm is that AT LEAST THEY'RE MORE ACTIVE THAN MOJANG. I only learned after the fact that Netherrealm does a release schedual for the DLC characters, but I heard that they released these things within a reasonable time frame. GTA 6 WILL come out before we even hear about confirmation on a Kombat Pack 3.

And Khaos Reigns. All you need to do is just glance at the reviews for it and see that something has gone horribly wrong, and that I am not a lone critic. The actual game itself while i'm writing this review, is 50 USD. The Khaos Reigns DLC is also 50 USD. Price tags set expectations, and with a price tag like that, one would expect the DLC to hold the same amount of quality and the same amount of content as the base game. However Netherrealm is not most people, and they don't expect you to be most people either. Because they expect you to be an absolute bozo who is willing to spend 50 dollars on 3 hours of content that NO ONE EVEN LIKED. I have been reading reviews for 45 minutes, and all i see are thumbs down, and three people who only picked thumbs up as a joke. It's like Netherrealm looked at what Call of Duty did with their overpriced DLC and said, ""Hmmm, yes, SOME OF THAT PLEASE!!""

And dear Super Earth, the Cameo system. Listen, i'm not skilled at this game by means. I'm new to fighting games, I have to look up guides on youtube on good combos, I struggle doing air moves, and I still have no idea what frame data is aside from the name. But the Cameo system was second most difficult thing I was struggling with during my time playing this nightmare. It is just so, so, sooooooooo difficult for me to figure out how to naturally use these characters that actually helps me out during the match. Shoot, it's difficult enough to find one that synergies with my actual character without looking up guides and stuff. And that's just my thoughts on using the Cameo Characters. Because I have a whole other complaint with them. Satans Hooves, why the god would you pick such an annoying way to under utilize your characters? Because I want to play as the cameo characters. Straight up, why can I not play as the Cameo Characters?

Like, I understand not wanting to let characters fade away and be forgotten, but i'd rather not know what i'm missing out on honestly. Because you're telling me that Sareena gets put into Cameo status, and not Ashrah? You're telling me that Lei Mei has more of a right on the proper roster than someone like Jax? I want someone from Netherrealm to look me in my eyes and tell me that Tanya is cooler than Shujinko. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON MOTARO, YOU KNOW, THE CYBORG CENTAUR WITH A LASER SCORPION TAIL!! GODDD WHYYY?! WHY WASN'T HE AN ACTUAL PLAYABLE CHARACTER?!?!?!!

And now we finally get to the most egregious thing about this game. The Climax of the show. The final nail in the coffin that got me to say, ""screw it!"" and actually write up a gods honest review. This is the worst optimized game I have ever played. It takes up 100 something gigs on my computer, refused to load on an external hard drive, crashes every time i load up Towers of Time, takes forever for the shaders to load, EATS my fuggin ram like a hungry HUNGRY HIPPOPOTAMUS, to the point that it will refuse to launch at times, stutters randomly during playing, and takes forever to load during anything, such as booting up the game, online matches, and even something as simple as switching between different costumes for the characters. AND THE WORST PART IS THAT THESE PROBLEMS NEVER LEFT. I PLAYED AT LAUNCH, EXPERIENCED ALL OF THIS, STOPPED PLAYING FOR A YEAR, **GOT A NEW COMPUTER,** AND STILL HAD ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS. 

Maybe it's just a me problem, maybe i'm just cursed, maybe no one else has had the same tech problems I have had with this game like I have. I say wait 10 years, or at least until they drop the price by like 30 dollars, AND THEN BUY THE GAME ON A BARGAIN SALE, IF YOU BUY IT AT ALL. Otherwise, get acquainted with Eiichiro Oda's literature, maybe study up on the filmography of Gore Verbinski, I don't know. That's my advice if you want to buy this game. But if you really want some advice? Want a solid review of the game? Then let me tell you this.

I've never heard of anything so idiotic as naming at least the 12th game in a series ""Mortal Kombat 1"". It's stupid and confusing and I hate that they expect us to call it that. It's entirely pointless too because the story makes it abundantly clear that although the timeline has been reset, the other games still happened. The events of the past games still happened and are frequently referred to in this game. Furthermore, the previous timelines basically just end up reasserting themselves through the events of this game, so really nothing changed except for precise chain of events that led to the same rivalries and a good number of characters being deleted to make room for new ones. It's just a dumb marketing gimmick that I don't see as even being successful. The menus all run like crap but at least it doesn't crash constantly like the previous game. The predatory DLC practices continue and are even worse though. The game costs $50 and the price of the first DLC expansion is exactly the same, more actually if you want ALL the content. The individual character packs are ridiculous too. $5 to $10 per character that they planned to include from the beginning, seriously? Playing the towers to unlock everything is repetitive, boring, and stupid. Even worse is the new Invasions which are basically a combination of the Krypt and Towers and equally pointless, repetitive, and stupid. Kameos? ALSO STUPID. It's incredibly frustrating that they took an annoying mechanic from the Towers and forced it into the base game. Just let us fight one opponent at a time, one on one. the way the game was designed for, please. Fatalities have lost all purpose and have somehow become part of the grind. Most of them aren't very entertaining after the 2nd or 3rd time if they even were the first time. Instead of being a cool bonus mechanic for skillfully defeating your enemy, now they are a requirement for EVERY FIGHT, especially if you want to earn points and unlock things - which like past games is going to take you decades to do anyway.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,176385632,"I'm fighting my way to keep this review positive. 

I never cared for fighting games, I don't like being "" competitive ""  nor being stressed out, but with Mortal Kombat I find entertaining trying out all the special movements, the fatalities, and just messing around for a while.

For this game I came out straight of a time machine, since I only played the first games from the 90s and after that lost track of the series (or any fighting games) after Mk3.

When Mortal Kombat 1 was announced then, I found the idea of a reboot of the series and probably going back to that first game from the 90s somewhat appealing.
 Those first games were cheesy, stupid, crazy, so bad they were funny, and didn’t' take themselves up too seriously. Also, they were gory. 

Returning to a fighting game after so long, I had zero expectations and no experience and I was only hoping to have that same casual experience I had with the first games, many years ago.

In that sense I believe the core experience of Mortal Kombat is still here, both in game play and crazy, stupid fun stuff that you can do with each fighter. The graphics have changed and improved a million, but also the gamepads we use today (X box controller at least) are much better than those we used many years ago.

Most importantly, if you have some fond memories of playing with the original fighters (like for example Sub-zero, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Raiden or Liu Kang) many of them are still here, although not everyone, some of them are secondary characters which you can use in a limited way as a “ Kameo “.

Still, the main single player campaign is fun and plays like a movie, with cutscenes that last several minutes each over the course of 15 chapters with 60+ fights. The cutscenes are probably unnecessary and frankly too long, but hey, It looks great, and again, is stupid fun, except when it takes itself too seriously (which luckily doesn't happen too often).

I understand that fighting games can get very technical and difficult, but that’s not my interest here, only to have a quick play and that is the main story campaign.

Then comes the other playing modes, sometimes they are ok (Tower even resembles the original Mortal Kombat) but other times they end up being more busy work than fun. Invasion begins barely ok, but it really goes towards being more about using coins and buying and selling stuff than just playing some fights and be done with it. It uses many tactics from free to play games.

It's a shame then that, taking the game as whole, aside from the main campaign at times it seems like Mortal Kombat is more worried about selling you coins than letting you play it.

So, there it is, that's why I'm ""fighting"" to get to the end of this review soon before turning negative.

The single player main game is there, and it is fun and well done, but there's so much noise around it, that the more you keep playing and trying other modes, the more it brings down what little fun you had with it.

I will "" finish "" my review here then, and stop playing Mortal Kombat 1 so I can have a nice memory of it and "" kill "" any thoughts of (not) having to spend any coins...

My issue in the end is that the game lacks that spark and style that a mortal kombat game should have in my opinion.

Everyone looks bland and I find it very hard to feel excited about any of the characters.  Its like they had a committee making sure that everything looked ""safe"" while at the same time just throwing internal organs and blood over it for effect.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,176252139,"This is the first review I've written for any game. Let me start off by saying I am likely in the minority here and absolutely love this game. Leagues ahead of MK11 in terms of gameplay, but behind MKX still (even if I personally enjoy it more.) The main mechanic that irks the community is the Kameo system. Personally, I love it. It isn't nearly as good as say MvC's or DBFZ's assist system, but it encourages creativity and it allows for a lot of play styles. Visually it looks amazing (of course) and if you are a fan of the PS2 era of MK, there will be a ton of fanservice that you'll appreciate. The story isn't the best, but it's not the worst. It has some amazing scenes, but the consistency is kinda all over the place. The netcode is also absolutely amazing (most of the time.) The main issue with online is it's just kinda bare bones. It is also a tad inconsistent as patches may just randomly make it not work. Now, on to most of the negatives for me. The customization, while there are a ton of great outfit designs, is VERY limited compared to MK11 and Injustice 2. Also, invasions is straight up just a chore to go through. It's nowhere NEAR as good as the Krypt in MK11. And now, the main reason I'm writing this review. As it stands right now, the Steam version is *almost* unplayable. The reason I say this is because, for some unknown reason, the FPS will freak out whenever anybody lands any hit. When this bug happens, the game is actually unplayable as it will go from 60fps to 10-15fps or basically wherever it wants to go. However, through my testing, it seems as if simply closing the game and opening it back up fixes the issue. Now, if you're like me and can bash your head against a wall and ""ignore"" the bug, then I think the game is very much worth picking up. But if the performance issue bothers you, then I suggest keeping up with the patches for the game to see when it gets fixed. The last thing I want to add is the premium store and DLC are unreasonably expensive. That's not to say a lot of the stuff isn't high quality (the DLC is amazing), but alternate outfits can be like $10 each which is more than a DLC character.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,176236160,"MK 1 once again manages to satisfy that craving for a brutal Fighting Game that lets me rip the spines out of my enemy.

But I have a lot to say about this game, both good and negative

I love (and hate) that the core gameplay has once again seen a drastic shift. Gone is the Defense/Attack Bar from MK11, finally replaced with its much superior 3 Bar approach that both MK9 and MKX had.
Fatal Blows are unfortunately still here and are just as annoying as in MK11.

The Kameo System is considered to be quite contentious among MK1 players but I find it to be a really nice compromise between the old Tag System in MK9 which had you swap between 2 full players, but was quite complex for a Kasual like me, but it still allows you to bring along a ""second character"" of sorts that have different abilities.
Now what I do HATE about the Kameo System isn't so much its gameplay, but moreso that NRS will just add any character to it when they are too lazy to give said character a dedicated fighter slot.

Instead as actual fighters we want, we get somebody like Nitara, who has to have one of the WORST voice acting performance I have ever seen by Megan Fox. The stark contrast of her lines when compared to ANY OTHER character in the game, especially in the story where you could go from somebody's great performance to the most monotonous, phoned in line delivery I have ever heard, is crazy.
NRS needs to stop hiring celebrities based on their popularity who will phone in a terrible performance and actually get the celebrities back who actually matter and cared about their work. Robin Shou as Liu Kang? Tagawa as Shang Tsung (Who was literally just in MK11 and could have reprised both his role and likeness here!)
What hurts even more is that Megan Fox couldn't even be bothered to act out the screams and hisses Nitara does, instead NRS hired a second Voice Actress! None other than Christina Vee herself who has a LONG LONG resume of outstanding VA performances under her belt and plenty of experience. Why did NRS not just use her to voice Nitara entirely?

Now let me actually talk about the Story Mode!
[spoiler]
Let us start with the good: MK 1 is such a refreshing mixup after NRS wrote themselves into a corner with MK11 and didn't know how to continue anymore. A good chunk of interesting characters up to that point were dead and their ace in the hole was to bring back the OG versions of characters by some contrived means. It made for a fun dynamic between old and developed characters and the young and inexperienced ones from MK1 (Old and young Johnny were cool together).

MK1 resets the timeline. But shaped entirely differently from the get-go with the intent to vastly change the chances that some characters have. For instance Shang Tsung and Quan-Chi were engineered to have a miserable life while characters like Bi-Han (OG Sub-Zero) would not be hunted by Scorpion.
It makes so many characters who were bland before, or whose stories we knew before, so much more interesting. Reptile is now a sympathetic person who ends up becoming a hero, rather than just Shao Khan's lapdog. Kuai Liang is now Scorpion and works together with Bi-Han from the very beginning, but in turn Hanzo Hasashi just...doesn't exist yet and is relegated to a cameo as a child in Smoke's Arcade Ending.
That is a massive shame because Hanzo had one of the best arcs in the previous timeline and was one of the coolest antiheros to me. Scorpion vs Sub-Zero is one of the FIRST things that come to people's mind when you think of MK, and it is just not here!
Raiden is no longer a god, but a humble farmer who ends up becoming the champion of the MK Tournament rather than Liu Kang. And Raiden hands-down has to be one of the best switch-ups in this story.

There is a lot of plus and minus here, and then at Chapter 9 it sadly dawns on me: This is just Deadly Alliance again but with characters in different places, or with different motivations.

Yeah you heard me right! This is just the Story of DA again because all the beads are there: Quan-Chi and Shang Tsung team up, want to resurrect an army to do their bidding etc. etc. but then at the same time, some things happen and some things don't. They take things that we already know about and just subvert them, but not in a way that makes me go ""Aha! thats cool"" but more in a ""Wow, that is boring"".
That...is disappointing. And once I realized what was going on my hype for the story came to a stand still.

But all that besides. The story has a bombastic definitive ending that I really enjoyed. It ends on a good note and leaves me very satisfied if this was the last game... If it wasn't for the after credits scene

Obviously the initial story left a bunch of plot holes and also, its 2024, you can't just leave a good story alone and just HAVE to add on to it. And the after credits scene teases what would come next in the story: Khaos Reigns.

The Khaos Reigns story can be summed up with one word: Unnecessary.
Not only is there a new villain, he is incredibly shallow and at this point the timeline nonsense has become too much for me. Its all about merging timelines once again by a villain that just seeks to destroy everything with no real understandable motivation.
But its just a slog. And once again it keeps just enough questions unanswered and enough leeway to make a new game/DLC.
Just play the original story and pretend that the after-credits scene doesn't exist and that Liu Kang's new timeline just chills after that.
[/spoiler]
And now the biggest issue of the game: Warner Bros. Games.
Yes. WB are back to RUIN MK once again by not just chucking all sorts of microtransactions into this game, but by also overpricing the game to hell and back.
I paid 90€ for this game when the Khaos Reigns DLC released to get both the base game and the Story DLC (Apparently that also gave me the Kombat Pack 1 and 2) but like... That is still an unacceptable price for a game that came out over a year ago!
But pricing aside, what truly ruins this game is my very first experience I had after buying it:

Whenever I buy a MK game I jump into a Klassic Tower, pick Liu Kang and just play a little to figure out the game for myself. 3 fights into the tower I lost connection to the Steam servers and my game was paused, a big ""The network connection has been lost"" message on my screen, and instead of letting me continue playing my SINGLEPLAYER MATCH it threw me back to the Main Menu...

Yes. Always-Online DRM is back...
Changing a Kosmetic for a character? you are greeted by a loading screen checking in with the server.
The game would even get stuck with the loading icon in the bottom right and just get stuck loading, leaving me entirely unable to do anything until I quit the game

This is so bad that I could also not even get into the Invasion Mode after finishing the Story. I already heard that it was a slog to play through from multiple sources and I wasn't even able to get an impression on it because after picking my Fighter, it was just stuck infinitely loading for several minutes before just throwing up a message.

So I try again and actually get in, play the first mission and after finishing this pretty trivial fight it just got stuck again after my win screen AND IT ERRORS OUT AGAIN AND WIPES MY PROGRESS AND THROWS ME BACK TO THE DAMN MAIN MENU

This is modern gaming. You can't just have a game release and just work anymore. It always has to attach MTX, egregious DRM to for the devs to make sure you TRULY own your game, and on top of that PC users get shafted everytime by attaching Denuvo, which is known to absolutely demolish the performance games.

I had so much more to say but Steam is limiting how much you can write into a review so I'll leave it here. I hate seeing this series devolve further. So I'll just not buy them anymore and watch the Story on YT from now on...",False,3,654

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,176057350,"Being an ultra-long-time fan of Mortal Kombat in general, I plunged headfirst into 2023's Mortal Kombat 1, knowing full well it promised a bold reboot for the franchise. I knew right away from the very first moment I booted this game up and started playing that this wasn't some rehash of the classic formula but a fresh take that reimagines both the storyline and gameplay. I wasn't disappointed.

Story and Narrative: New Beginnings

Of course, first and foremost was the storyline. Mortal Kombat 1 is set within an entirely different timeline for the fact that Fire God Liu Kang did reset the universe after that chaos which went on in Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath. Great stuff to see how a few of these very familiar faces fall into new roles and newer relations. More precisely, a storyline of characters that I knew so well had been remade, and I wonder about finding their new dynamic. But for me, the standout feature was in that story mode. The seamless transitioning between the cut scenes and the battles flowed into one another almost as if some sort of ultra-cinematic experience was chosen. It genuinely made me feel like I was right inside the action movie. True to series tradition, it managed to pull out newer dimensions of the characters that I grew up watching, to the point of indulgence in the plot.
There are twists aplenty, but none of them felt like forced fits-they all worked together with the rebooted timeline in a fashion that made sense.

Game-play: Brutality and Strategies

It genuinely does feel like Mortal Kombat 1 has taken everything that I loved about the series and then polished each one of those things to perfection. Controls are tighter, and character movements are much more fluid. Core mechanics remain the same old combo and special move jazz, but with the addition of the Kameo system, it genuinely brings a whole layer of strategy.
The Kameo fighters are like assist characters, and being able to call them in during a match added a lot of depth to the fighting system. There’s more to consider than just my own character’s moves—I had to think about when and how to use my Kameo fighter for maximum impact.

The deaths are as brutally appealing as ever, and yeah, I'm still wincing and cheering in equal measure. Visually, it's really upped the ante because every hit and finishing move was coming out more viscerally and satisfying. Every single one of the characters' fatalities feels different and grossly creative, which has always been what made this series so unique.

Sight and Sound: A Feast before the Senses

Graphically, this is really great-even the tiniest details of the characters, from the texture of clothes to every single facial expression of theirs in a fight, are highly detailed. Each stage has a thick, dynamic background that seems to pulse with life and atmosphere. Everything from thick jungle to the bottom of the fiery Underworld makes a great difference, adding so much to the experience.
Sound design in Mortal Kombat 1 is but a punch. Literally, every punch, kick, and bone-crunching move has those meaty sound effects that really help sell weight and satisfaction in combat. Voice acting is great, with every character delivering their lines with such great conviction that it really adds an extra layer of immersion into the storytelling and gameplay.

Online Play and Modes: Room to Grow One aspect I was super hyped on diving deep into was its online multiplayer. The matchmaking system is rather decent; I really did not get a lot of lag, which is essential in such a game where timing is key, and one split second can get you defeated. In my experience, though, there's an imbalance with a number of characters, especially against high-level players who would know just how to exploit a certain move in question.

Extra modes of play, such as Towers of Time and Klassic Towers, let me flex my skills a lot of other ways away from the story. Sure, they really add replayability, but man, I just could not help it: I came back to story mode and multiplayer most. It's not a game that actually skimps on content, which, really, is an aspect I highly appreciate since I am a great fan of fighting games. Final Comments Mortal Kombat 1 has been so much better than I set my expectations for in almost every regard, really treading new ground with its respect for the heritage, storytelling, mechanics of play, and presentation. Whether ultra fan or just new and trying to get into the hype of this game, it's worth buying. It's visceral, action-packed, and true to the brutal charm that has made Mortal Kombat a staple of the fighting genre for decades.",True,1,2371

The stakes feel empty because there are infinite timelines, so a new villain can just walk out of a timeline portal every day, or every second. Anyone who dies can be replaced with another timeline version, and Liu Kang can just make a new timeline if everything goes bad.
It makes me wonder, why should I bother getting invested?


Other than Baraka, almost every character is a more generic and one-dimensional version of themselves from previous ""timelines"". 
Havik is the worst for this. He went from being an unpredictable, neutral, shit-stirrer. To a generic, angry, villain that just yells all the time. 
Bi-Han is a close second. He's now just an irredeemable dickhead that betrays his family and clan, all because a stranger promised him an army.


Character designs range from pretty good, to painfully bland and boring (The hairstyles for the women are especially disappointing). There are way too many lazy palette swaps. I don't know who'd want to play as Swamp Green and Faded Orange Kitana, or Brown and Maroon Raiden. Why even include these?
The costume slots are filled with upwards of 30 crap pallets and 2 ""good"" ones.


Invasions is by far the most boring side-mode they've made. At least Deadly Alliance gave you pieces of your characters story from node-to-node. This is just a filler slog that can take hours to complete every season, and the story is about some random timeline that is going to be banished by the end of the season, so why even care?
(They've tweaked the mode so that you can just run past most of the nodes, but it still feels like a chore)

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,175762398,"I'll probably catch flak for this from paid WB accounts, bots, and fanboys on here, but here we go.

Really bad. Mortal Kombat used to rock. It's my favorite franchise of all time, but now it just sucks. It's unimaginative. I don’t mind new stuff, but do it in a way that’s not price-gouging, unimaginative, and still pays homage to the series.

Story: Convoluted as hell with the multiverse nonsense. The expansion feels like it was written for the old 2000s WB channel—terrible writing. There are so many alternate versions of characters that it’s hard to care about your favorites, especially since they've all been replaced with the timeline reset. Here's an example of how bad the writing is: A character who can turn into water gets crushed to death after holding up walls to save his wife, Tanya. You can turn into water, dude! That’s like Raiden dying from sticking a fork in an electrical outlet. It makes no sense.

Design: Really lame design for Khaos Reigns. Almost every alternate Khaos version of a character is the same: a little bit of green, a little bit of gold, add a mohawk. It's supposed to be dark and crazy. Why don't we have Khaos alternates that look ripped up and mutilated like Havik? Why don't they look like badass Cenobites? Slapping on a mohawk is the edgiest design they could come up with?

Paywalled: $50 for Khaos Reigns, which is roughly an hour and a half long. $10 for holiday fatalities. Price-gouged cosmetics? No thanks.

Boring Modes: Seasons—yawn. Towers of Time is back—yawn.

No Bosses: And putting the word ""Titan"" in front of a character doesn’t make them a boss. What happened to the big baddies like Onaga, Blaze, Moloch, Goro, Kintaro, Shao Kahn, Demon Shinnok, and OG Shang Tsung? Really goddamn lazy, WB/NetherRealm.

No Classic MK Secrets: Stages, fighters, hidden fatalities, hidden Easter eggs? Gone. All the fun mystery is gone.

No Stage Fatalities: Booooo...

No Stage Interactables: Boooo...

No Pit: Where the hell is the Pit?

Overall Look: It’s too goddamn bright. It feels like they're trying to make James Gunn’s Mortal Kombat. Terrible. They almost had it perfect with MK11. We need a darker tone.

Stages: A bit ADHD. They’re detailed and beautiful, yes, but look at the original Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 stages—highly imaginative, dangerous, simple but well done. MK11 did a great job replicating that look.

Roster: Great, except due to the multiverse, none of the characters feel like themselves in the story. You want Scorpion? Well, now he's Sub-Zero. Cyrax and Sektor? Totally changed, just body armor. Raiden? Nope, now he’s Liu Kang. Liu Kang? Nope, now he's Raiden. They basically shell-gamed all your favorite characters because they’re running out of ideas.

What we need for the next MK: Back to basics (MK as a tournament), focus on fatalities and immersion (secrets, unique stages, lore), less goofy, and less like Guardians of the Galaxy. Make Mortal Kombat dark, brooding, and dangerous. Design it more around Oriental culture like the original games—think Big Trouble in Little China, Enter the Dragon, Bloodsport, etc. I’d love to see a reimagining of the original three games in Unreal Engine 3 with a dark tone. Make Mortal Kombat dark and mysterious again.

I will cut it right to the chase, [b]don't buy the Khaos Reigns expansion, get the characters individually[/b]. 
The dlc campaign is the most rushed and uninteresting piece of crap i have ever seen and surely belongs to the list of one of the worst campaigns this franchise had. I would like to begin by saying that the devs still have not learned about good rewards. The expansion rewards you with lame cosmetics, terrible color palettes, artwork, stages which are decent and a couple announcers: Noob and Havik, so you won't be missing much.
The whole story is rushed from the beginning to end, where in certain scenes characters that were fighting will just skip to being captured, downed or just disappear from existence until further notice. Havik as a villain in this story feels odd, there is nothing special about him he is just a lazy re-skinned Havik with an army of lazy re-skinned re-used characters that look cringy af and want to spread chaos.

[i]Seriously, Havik in this dlc feels like a reboot of Meat than an actual Havik. The outfit and all of Havik's powers just scream Meat to me, being able to remove limbs and grow them back is something Meat would do whereas Havik would just crack his bones.[/i]

Anyways, the campaign allows you to play as the three main characters of this dlc: Sektor, Cyrax and later on Noob Saibot. But not just them, the story also wants you to play as alternative versions of characters like Tanya and Rain (which are there to replace what it feels like Jade and Kotal Kahn) these 2 alternative versions are literally what Jade and Kotal (or maybe Sindel and Shao) were supposed to be except Tanya and Rain are together as empress and emperor, they come from a different dimension which is why this would make sense, but that does not mean it is interesting. The story tries to focus on these 2 characters for a bit and tries to make dramatic scenes that end up just being mediocre, to the point that after so much chatter and boring events you end up wanting to beat the sh*tshow of a campaign Khaos Reigns is.

--Mortal Kombat 1 Review: A $120 Cash Grab, Wrapped in 135 GB of Disappointment--

Where do I even begin with *Mortal Kombat 1*? Oh, I know—how about the fact that this bloated, 135-GB monstrosity of a game is an absolute disaster, especially if you're playing on PC. For a game that eats up more space on my hard drive than a full season of a Netflix series in 4K, you’d think it would run smoothly, right? Wrong. It’s a slideshow masquerading as a fighting game, with optimization so bad it makes you wonder if WB even cares. Spoiler: they don’t. Why? Because they’re too busy counting all the money they’re squeezing out of their fanbase with microtransactions that rival Ubisoft's worst efforts.

------------- Graphics? Sure. But Everything Else? Just No.
Yes, I’ll give it this: *MK1* looks *beautiful*. The visuals are stunning, characters are detailed, and the special effects are downright gory in the best way possible. But you know what? You can slap a fresh coat of paint on a dumpster, and it’s still a dumpster. That’s this game. The only thing that works is the graphics, and once you get over that shiny surface, the rot underneath is impossible to ignore.

--------- Microtransactions and Greed: WB’s Favorite Fatality
Do you like grinding for hours just to unlock a second fatality? Or maybe you'd prefer to drop another $50 on microtransactions after already shelling out for the base game? Because those are your two choices if you want to unlock anything meaningful in this game. Gone are the days when you could play Mortal Kombat and feel rewarded for actually playing. Now it’s just another soulless cash grab.

The Khaos Reigns bundle is a whole new level of scam artistry. $120 CAD down the drain, and for what? Not even getting the content I paid for. How the **hell** did the Premium edition get overwritten by the Khaos Reigns edition, which costs *less* and offers *more*? Are you telling me I paid extra for an early access ticket to disappointment? **Ed Boon better fly down here and personally apologize**, because WB just mugged me in broad daylight.

--------- The PC Port is a Dumpster Fire
Do you have a gaming PC? Great! You still can’t run this thing. I’ve got a solid rig that handles *Baldur’s Gate 3*, *Starfield*, and *Final Fantasy 16* with no problem, but *MK1*? Nah. The moment you pull off a fatality, your game turns into a PowerPoint presentation. The frame drops are horrendous. Forget about buttery smooth finishers—you’ll be lucky if you get through the whole match without it freezing like someone pulled the plug on your PC.

Oh, and if you’re like me and decided to reduce the graphics settings to bare minimum, prepare for the ""smooth"" stutter to continue. Doesn't matter if you're playing at 720p or looking at the game like it's a 1990s arcade fighter on dial-up internet. 

------------ Story Mode: From Great to Utter Garbage
*Mortal Kombat* has always had pretty decent story modes for a fighting game, and at first, I thought *MK1* was no exception. I was having a blast—until they pulled the old ""multiverse"" nonsense in the last couple of chapters. Suddenly, nothing mattered. Every decision? Pointless. Every outcome? Meaningless. There’s no emotional investment when you can just undo everything with some lazy multiverse explanation. WB took what could’ve been a strong narrative and flushed it down the toilet in the last chapters. The story had me, and then they dropped me off a cliff.

------------------ Kameo System: Who Asked for This?!
Ah yes, the new ""Kameo"" system. Because *clearly* what Mortal Kombat fans have been crying out for is a half-baked assist mechanic that forces you to watch your favorite characters awkwardly tag in, then tag out, with no flow. I don’t want to see Scorpion team up with whoever’s available. I want to *play* Scorpion. This new system feels like a gimmick, an unnecessary one that detracts from the core 1v1 combat. It's like they threw it in just because they needed something ""new."" Well, guess what? It doesn’t work, and it’s a massive letdown.

---------------- No Krypt? More Like No Fun.
Remember the Krypt from previous *MK* games? Yeah, they got rid of that and replaced it with loot boxes. Want a skin or some cool gear? Too bad. Now you get concept art—*concept art*, seriously? If you want anything remotely interesting, get your credit card ready. Loot boxes are the epitome of lazy design. WB isn’t even hiding their greed anymore.

---------------Customization: From a Gold Standard to a Joke
MK11 set the bar so high with its customization. You could mix and match gear, change colors, and really make your character your own. In *MK1*, customization is such an afterthought it’s insulting. You can change tiny pieces of an outfit and call it a day, but if you want anything cool? Prepare to grind your soul away—or better yet, just buy it. Because what’s the point of rewarding players with content they paid for when you can squeeze a few more bucks out of them, right?

------------------ The Grind is Real—And Not in a Good Way
If you don’t want to spend real money, good luck unlocking anything worthwhile. Want that sick fatality or brutality? Be ready to sink hours into the game just to get a few cosmetics, and that’s if the RNG gods favor you. Otherwise, you’re grinding for nothing. In previous games, you’d play and unlock content as you went. Here, you just get frustrated.

---------------------------- Conclusion: Wait for the Komplete Edition (And a Sale)
Honestly, I can’t recommend *Mortal Kombat 1* to anyone in its current state. Between the ridiculous microtransactions, unoptimized mess of a PC port, the half-baked new mechanics, and WB’s relentless greed, it’s just not worth it. Even if you’re a die-hard fan of the series, do yourself a favor: wait for a sale, wait for the inevitable “Komplete Edition,” and save yourself the headache of dealing with this overpriced, underwhelming game.

Until then, WB can keep their $60 DLCs and overpriced skins. I’ve already made the mistake of supporting this cash-grabbing, half-baked excuse of a game, and I’m not doing it again.

Now we have this, I paid 120 dollars for a game edition that is now unavailable....

But what made this game so unappealing?

Well, let's start with the pros:
+ The graphic design is beautiful.
+ The story is interesting to follow and has some very new iconic moments.
+ They brought back older characters that fans have wanted for a long time, while keeping some of the older characters.

The cons:
- The whole game is a cash grab
You see  some characters in the main story, are not playable in the main game.
(Ermac, Quan Chi, Shang tsung)
Which is just embarrassing that you have to buy 3 DLC packs for 24 dollars just to play normal characters.

- The game looks good but runs extremely poorly. 
Don't limit me to 60 fps, I bought a triple A title.

- The new cameo feature is the worst idea ever, it's not fun, it doesn't feel good and it doesn't work well.

- The new combat system is the worst thing imaginable, a simple ground combo and then spam air combos?
I loved about MK11 that you couldn't just do a cheap combo and then completely destroy the person in the air.
It just doesn't feel like MK.

- The crypt is now a slot machine....... with a 1min animation........ from 10/10 in MK11 to 0/10.

-Camos all look the same.... Nothing special about them except the price.

But what really killed me was buying a game before release, waiting for them to finish it and then months later slapping me in the face, calling me a dumb fuck and then releasing a 60 DOLLAR DLC WITH EVEN MORE STUPID SHIT.

I really started loving Mortal Kombat with MK11 and then even played 10, 9 and 2 just because those games were so good.

Now we have WB who just destroyed MK for me.......
I'm sure in 1 year when the game dies, an all inclusive bundle will come out for 10 bucks.

This is a joke, WB is a joke, I'm disappointed and ashamed that I was so gullible and thought paying over 100 dollars for a game was ok.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,175528942,"Worst „Main” Mortal Kombat since MK4.

Long time MK player (since MK Trilogy) . Controversial statement for sure, but my main gripe is excessive juggling verging on parody/pastiche. So if you like this type of gameplay - game is for you. 

MK 1 evolved into „Eastern” style of fighting game with focus on long boring combos. MK had juggling like in MK9/MKX, but now it is intolerable. You can be juggle for up to 25 seconds (!) and then someone may use kameo and fatal blow and you are watching animation for over 30 secodns! Which is nearly 1/3 of whole round! Every round! Do you understand how ridiculous that is? Nearly no one writes about that and it is the worst aspect of MK1. If you are not a good player dont even start KL league. You will be juggled to bordom/death. Single hit in this game should not juggle you up and extend the combo so much. The best example would be Johnny Cage

Horrible uninspiring gameplay with no variation in fighting against players in KL. 

And as there is no content for singleplayer (Invasions are horrible) so you will constantly play against the same characters. Around 5 – 7 (not only that the also use the most cancerous Kamoes too): Johny Cage, Smoke, Raiden, Sub Zero, Scorpion, Baraka, Reptile. Most braindead characters I may add. There will be some mix up with dlc character and others, but it is rare. All players use only one combo over and over again. Scorpion knee juggle aerial, Raiden cartwheel, Sub zero overhead/slide, Smoke jugle teleport, Omni man earial punching or Johny Cage braindead pressure with mix up low/up and so on. In MK11/X you at least have some variations – here there is none. If you make one mistake then watch unskipable 20 seconds combo animation over and over again. You’ve got one combo breaker, but what is the point. It loads too slow and this game is based only on combos, so you can block or use breaker, but there will be another attempt, and another, and another. So to unskippable juggle carousel you go. 

Kameos

Not a fan. Creators and some players say that they bring great variation into the gameplay and combat, but what is the point of all this kameos when only around 5 are used. Not only that but players in KL force you to use „good” Kameos, beacuse you will not win with them using Sareena, so what is the point of trying others? Only kameos expanding the combos and air combos are used - rest is thrown into oblivion with exception of some teleports and defensive abilities, but the pale in  comparision to the „Sareena ones”. Sareena, Cyrax, Ferra Tor, Frost, Khameleon. There are specific cancerous/parasitic mix ups like Johnny Cage – Kano where you cheat on frames. But mostly you see Sareena. There should be gameplay mode without them and I truely hope Kameos will be no more. 

Moreover: 

No content for singleplayer, no crypt (!), no customization (you cannot even take off a mask from characters – compared to MK11 it looks like a demo game), mindless grinding, ugly skins, invasion mode is like a bad joke, horrible PC port, desyncs during gameplay, playing against the same players in KL few times in the row, no 60 FPS for PC for over 8 months, stutter up to 15 seconds in KL where every second is priceless in playing against human player, paid fatalities (ugh!), no nerfs to obviously broken characters, toxic players base, constant harrasment to the point that microphone has to be turn off. And many more. 

For that price and their DLC you can have MK11 or MKX and MK9 (best in the series). I will never buy any MK game on premiere now. NetherRealm forgot that they nearly sunk the franchise and only MK9 saved them from oblivion. Maybe you should remind yourself the roots of the series. Don’t buy it for full price and do not buy their DLC.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,175225417,"TLDR: Gameplay is solid. Kameo system and other gameplay mechanics are unique and cool (IMO). Rest of the game is lackluster and lacking severely compared to similar games in the genre.  Strongly recommend not purchasing or at least waiting for it to go on sale for a very reduced price.

Yeah so..... Game released unfinished and took over a year to make the game an actual product worth purchasing. Please keep this in mind when reading the review. This is a product they offered for upwards of $110 USD at launch, which literally was just a pre-order of the DLC and a Jean Claude Van Damme skin for Johnny . That in an of itself is reason enough to recommend not purchasing, but there is actually so much more to discuss.

PROS:
- Gameplay:  The gameplay is actually really solid. I really appreciated NRS going back to their old meter system, where you earn you meter throughout the match and brought back the breaker system, while keeping the flawless block mechanic, while also introducing new mechanics like the 'up block' and 'uppercut jump cancel'. The Kameo system (IMO) is actually pretty cool. Although its not perfect, I still like how kameos add a unique way to approach certain match ups and offers different tech and setups for the main fighters.

CONS:
- Lack of single player content:  Story mode, Towers, or Invasions (which is Towers, BUT DIFFERENT!). That is your MK 1 single player experience. Story mode can be finished in like 2-3 sessions. First half of story was promising but second half was utter trash. It read like they consulted ChatGPT on how to finish the script.  Towers is, well, towers and Invasions... *SIGH* If you know, you know.

- Lack of customization: I'm not big on customizing characters or whatever. But for people who do value it, it is a big step down from what you had in MK 11. Most of the content has to be earned by grinding invasions for hours and hours (ew) or is hidden behind micro transactions.  MK 1 is the Overwatch 2 of fighting games. But even OW 2 is free to play.

- Lack of online features:  There are two subcategories here. 1) Features that were missing at launch and have since been added (at least in some part), and 2) Features that are still not available that reasonably should be. 

1) Cross-play between PC and Console, a way to deny playing against wireless players in ranked, a way to pin moves from the movelist in training mode.

2) An *actual* matchmaking filter system for both ranked and player matches, KOTH room matchmaking, Player room matchmaking, online training mode, an ability to choose a KOTH lobby.

All the features above are present in ALL other big name fighting game titles. I recently purchased Under Night In-Birth 2, which is a small anime fighter produced from a significantly smaller company with way less resources and even that game has more comprehensive matchmaking features than MK1.

- Constant bugs and connectivity issues:  Matchmaking in this game was absolutely horrible on PC only until very recently. There was a period of time (MONTHS of time) where basically every other ranked set you played ended in desynchronization and forced players back into the online main menu, which meant the matches you just played didn't count. During this time you'd be lucky to get one complete set every five/six sets played. The game also launched with 'Player 1 advantage', which basically meant certain combos could only be performed on player 1 side. This advantage hasn't occurred since MK 9. Even in current day, the overall online experience is underwhelming. Even in games that are listed at >50ms, I still run into lag spikes and latency issues, almost every single game. I run wired 700ms down / 50ms up consistently. For a game that runs a funded series for competitive players, they sure seem to be lacking the resources to add sufficient servers for online play (which is where 99.9% of the players actually play).


CONCLUSION:  Although the game play is a huge step up from MK 11 and is fun to play most of the time, the rest of the game is just lacking in so many ways. I've run the cycle of: Uninstall because game is uninteresting atm --> see new DLC and update announced --> reinstall and play for about 3 days --> get bored and repeat step 1. Given NRS's recent track record with MK 11 and now MK 1, its safe to say I would not recommend buying the base game nor buying the upcoming expansion DLC ($50 USD, LMAO). I would recommend you try another fighting game instead or just purchase any of the other previous NRS titles.",False,7,21756

🔴🔴spoilers 🔴🔴

I was expecting something new, a new villain or a real threat. Instead we get Shang and Chi in a weaker deadly alliance role. They are beat on multiple occasions and are shown early to not a threat. I wanted to see someone like onaga come back into this. The set up was there, but no instead we get to have a sloppy end with your character fighting randomized fighters like raden and reptile mixed and gender swapped classic ninjas. Only to fight Shang for the 6th time as the final boss. Havik is in this game for 10 minutes max and is completely over looked.  Shao khan is completely wasted. They turned him into a jobber, he doesn't win a single fight in story mode. Not one. He looks sloppy,  weak and they gave him the stupidest design. Through out this entire story they introduce multiple fighters, just to give them a chapter and move on. Ashrah, Baraka, Kung Lao, Raden. All have little to nothing after they win 3 fights. Classic fighter are referenced only to not be used. Ermac is completely ruined turning him into jarod was the dumbest choice ever! The final fight Is absolutely garbage. It is the worst of this entire franchise.  The DLCs coming won't save this game. I was so excited, I spent 110 dollars on it. I watched all news and trailers for this, I was so invested for months on end. Just for a complete waste of time,  money and energy.  They don't respect the fans, the history and this was a huge money grab. If you wanna buy this game just wait a couple months it will be on sale for 20 or less. Garbage game, fighters either fight the same or are clunky and have 2 moves. Kameos are a cool idea. But suck and don't make any difference. All In all...this game had put a mask up saying it was huge and a completely game changer. Only to have no real threat.  I beat the damn story mode on hard In a few hours no sweat.  Frigging Shujinko isn't even a part of story mode and he got a trailer!!! Not what I was expecting.  Fights are fun and fatalities are good. But man, I am just so disappointed in this game. I hope the next one can bounce back.  Giving a 2 star only because some character designs are amazing, Reptile, Lu Kang, Ashrah and Melina look and play smooth. I really just expected more. I will never pre order a Mortal Kombat game ever again. And I seriously doubt they will ever respect the history of the games at nether studios.",True,1,49098

I played MKX and MK11 to death and was so excited for this game. The change in mechanics and the duo system or whatever you want to call it is fun but after 18 hours in the game I've yet to unlock any second fatalities which is just making the game feel boring and repetitive.

Lack of krypt...

There's no Krypt in this game and it's been traded out for just rng lootbox for unlocking just concept art and that's it. Such a loved feature traded out so that if you want any other skin you have to buy micro-transactions. 

Lag to no end...

When I finally get to the enjoyment of using fatalities and finishing blows they just seize up and lag and show. 4 frames of a slideshow and then ""you won yay"". I ran the benchmark and get full 60fps easily but the second you use a fatality or finishing blow it all goes out the window which just takes the most satisfying part and turns it into the most aggravating...

Story...

I was having fun with the story until it turned into ""ooooo mulitverse"" and immediately I felt as though nothing mattered anymore as the story just becomes consequence-less. 

I love MK but I've played this so little compared to last titles and coming back to play quick matches here and there just remind me of how disappointing this one was...",False,10,1138

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,174282835,"In this franchise, especially after the MK1-3 era, they have been replacing previously female characters with transgenders. The reasons for this are unclear, but one possible explanation is a misguided attempt to adhere to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) principles. However, the absence of female characters contradicts the very concept of inclusivity. Another possible explanation is, perhaps they want to avoid violence against women. This is great news if you want to fight as ladyboys, but if you expect to see hot women as the 90's movies Kitana and Sonya then I'm here to save your wallet.

Despite these issues, the game boasts impressive environmental graphics, effects, and an engaging story line. However, the Invasion mode endgame content failed to captivate me, and I haven't returned to it since completing the story. 

I haven't played multiplayer mode so I recommend checking other reviews if you're interested in it. It should also be noted that this game's button layout is not really hitbox or arcade friendly. It's more designed to be played by a controller. Also there's a need for L3/R3 button in the Invasion mode so your older hitbox would not be able to support it. Additionally, the decision to make some kameos non-playable fighters is a significant disappointment. It should not be difficult to include kameos as playable characters. Inclusion of unrelated characters, superheroes over familiar characters is also a questionable decision.

Another frustrating aspect is the incorrect pronunciations, for example they pronounce ""Shirai-Ryu"" as ""Shirai Ra-yu"", and ""Liu Kang"" as ""Liu Keng"" and some others. This is a disrespectful mispronunciation that demonstrates a lack of research and respect for the original languages, which could also mean lack of Diversity in their development staff.

While the game's price may be high, it has a lot of contents and it is a game-as-a-service (GaaS) model with no pay-to-win elements.

They also decided to genderswap Sektor and Cyrax for whatever reason (and make them look like MCU Iron Man rejects), and they kinda just wasted three guest character slots on the T-1000, Ghost Face, and... well, Conan sounds cool, but the others could've been WAY cooler.

The story mode was basically a movie not much the player can do there nothing you can't just watch on Youtube.

Honestly the only thing this TRASH game has going for it, it will be the graphics but most of the time all i see is a black screen and the not responding message from windows.

THE STORY: They promised this was supposed to be a brand new story and was supposed to be a more thought out less complicated story than the original but its really just a Continuation/remake. As if they took MK11, Deadly Alliance, and Armageddon and just made it into one game, that's basically MK1 and hate to say it but THAT IS LAZY. Whats the point of reshaping a brand new timeline if things are just going to happen the same way they did before but even more complicated. - Make it Make sense

THE GAME PLAY: I am not a big fan of the Kameo system. I just don't find it fun in a sense that i have to rely on a second character to either continue a combo or break out of one but yet cannot play as that second character so like whats the point. Just would seem a lot more fun if it was more like MK9 and be a 2v2 or if you want have the option to play 1v1 just seems like a waste. Not to mention the Kameos are very unbalanced nowadays why use anyone other than Ferra?

CUSTOMIZATION: Not much to say other than they hoed us. The customizing is basically just swapping skins and colors so less options to make different styles or even save them.

The game as a whole compared to previous just seems sad. They had every opportunity to make an amazing fighter game with more options of play modes, characters and a more compelling and reasonable story but as I said it just seemed like they didn't know what exactly they wanted to do and just said F it (AKA) they got LAZY.",False,3,4719

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,173326934,"Before the DLC trailer I was in mixed feelings, but after this I definitely formed my opinion.

This game is just bad with over price. 
The first part of the storyline seems to be interesting, but in the second part we have second Shang Tsung, second Quan Chi, second Raiden, Sindel, Liu Kang and so on. It used to be interesting refresh of original story with a new vision of the past events of the Mortal Kombat universe, but no. Screenwriters decided that this game should be the sequel but with multiverse like a Marvel style. And it should be not only the Marvel-style multiverse, it should be the Marvel-style multiverse with changed gender original male characters. No twists, no drama, no character's growth - the story is just a genderswap multiverse. It's a very lazy screenwriters work wich hard to watch and boring to play.

The second negative part is that it's awkward optimized port for PC. Literally, I have no idea how to put in the game the one new character and brake the whole f*cking software interaction. My friend plays with me since release the game, but after release of Quan Chi his game crashed. Reinstallation fixed the crash but fps dived to 11-13. And that's end. We tried to repair his software and hardware to reach the better interaction with the game but nothing changed. It was a mirracle when he launchs the game in april-may after update with locked 60 fps and there are no issues. But this shit happens again in the day of release Takeda. 12 fps in game that noone wanna fix.
Btw we have the same configuration.

And the last part is the DLC. I have no suitable words how to describe my feelings. After trailer I sat front of monitor with the stoned face and thought about what the f*ck I've just watched. They promised us that cyborgs will be in the game. That was lie. There will be teenagers in exosuits with names of cyborgs in the game. As gamers we had a greate story of conflicts and betrayal between members of idiological clan, and we could understand characters and situation. But now we will have a story of teenage rebellion insteed. Why? Who knows and who cares. It could be probably on the mark if this game was a rethinking of original story, but it's not. I remember, it is a logical sequel for the previos game with a multiverse. Does we have no teenage characters in the game yet? Do a lot of gamers passionly wait for the another playable Arnold Schwarzenegger with a big bad sword? I guess everybody knows the answer without me.
And, of course, the price. The price of DLC, this lazy empty soulless DLC, is close to the original game. There is nothing to say. I dont' want pay for it.

Verdict is lazy scenario, bad optimization, ridiculously high price for the whole downloadable content. It's not worth any money anymore.",False,4,7200

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,173185813,"I hate to say it but as a  fighting game lover who started with the mortal kombat franchise and grew up with it along with Killer Instinct , I can not recommend mortal kombat 1 on pc in its current state. There is still so much wrong with this game  and the franchise in general over the last couple of years. 

Lets start with the biggest problem with this game which is lack features and things to do in this game esp offline. I will start with the offline  part of it. The game released with literally bare bone features and game modes. You have the story that can be completed in a couple of days. You have the classic and traditional towers which will last you a bit longer but kind of gets boring versing the AI. It gives you individual character ending upon completing the  classic tower and some the character endings are kind of lame in  this game. You do have a practice mode and tutorials section and it is quite good and it does have  some advanced things it  teaches you but unless you really like the gameplay you are not going to spend a lot of time on it. And the last offline mode which  I find the most boring is a mode called the invasions mode. It replaces the krypt which was way better and more immersive. It is basically  different themed tile sets of single fights and challenges combined completed with a character of your choice and it has a top down view. There are different seasons for that mode in which you acquire different skins and rewards.  After you go through all the tile sets once you get sick of repeating it again and again for every season just to get new skins and  rewards. Instead of trying to evolve the krypt mode from previous games into an konguest third person mode and get the reward that way they replaced it with this boring mode.

Onto the online part of the  game now it lacks a lot of stuff other fighting games have . It doesn't have rooms where you can invite friends in a list and fight them one at a time and you cant just fight casually online either you have do to ranked mode  and mortal kombat's ranked system isn't very good. It doesn't separate players of different skill very well. Crossplay wasn't available at launch and you can't practice against the cpu while you wait for opponents online like in other fighting  games. On top of that performance wise the netcode and servers still have issues like de-synchs and lag.

Now onto the next  big problem with this game which is gameplay. Again NRS release their next fighting game with very little univeral mechanics esp defensive. Instead they introduced a gimmicky assist like system called the kameo system that wasn't well thought out and is just assist characters throwing out more special moves. And what makes matters worse is that it replaces the 1v1 mode so now you can't play without the kameos which hurts the games longevity even more.  Movement is yet again clunky and feels retarded.  Inputs and utility for legacy moves have been changed yet again for main roster characters because they rebuild their game from the ground up instead of building upon it like other fighting games do.  All this doesn't help when characters  either have small move lists or watered down movesets. The kameo system does add a little variety for gameplay but it shouldn't be at the expense of universal mechanics or other game modes. Overall the gameplay feels bland and repetitive, even some pros find the game boring now. There is also a balance issue with the power level of characters. NRS said they would buff the characters and add more moves but so far the patches are very small and the most changes have been done to kameos instead of the base roster characters.

The next issue with this game is yet again the roster. NRS still don't or cant go above 24 or 25 characters for their base roster and they cant help themselves overdo it with guest characters yet again that don't belong in the mk universe. There is going to be even more guest in this game than in mk11. On a good note they did add  some 3d Era characters which players were asking for like Ashrah and Li Mei which is a nice change. Also they did put a lot of the ninjas in the base roster. They now decided to make the main villain boss character Shang Shung a paid dlc which sucks instead of unlocking him in game and they removed two characters that were in the story to be dlc characters. Their models were already in game and had animations and moves. To make matters worse they made some fan favourite characters kameo assist fighters instead of fully playable base roster characters like Sonya and Jax. They are adding dlc characters to the game and some of them like Ermac and Takeda look interesting but they are accompanied by guest dlc characters also and too many of them if you ask me in a single dlc pack.

Onto the story mode and characters. The story was decent half way through but it ended up going to shit afterwards cause they decided to bring the timeline rubbish back into this game again as well as it being influenced by this multiversus DC crap which I don't find interesting at all. Also dialogue was a bit cheesy and awful in some parts. You got to see some of the characters become what they are which is nice. Some characters also got completely redesigned and had their origins changed. Some of it was ok but some of it went too far to the point where characters just lost their identity completely almost. 

Other issues in this game include overpriced micro transactions for things like classic skins stuff. Music almost being non existant or boring like in mk11. Customisation being too basic and overall  the game loosing its dark nostalgic feel it used to have.

Overall like I said I do not recommend this game esp at full price. I spent $40 Australian on this game. Don't get me wrong you will get some enjoyment out of it. Some of the characters are fun to play and story is half decent but there is just too much missing in this game or issues with this game and it has lost its soul identity as a mk game.

The simpler uniforms bring it back to its origins (minus Kano and Sonya as playable characters). Then you get Kung Lao, Kitana, Milena, Baraka, etc making it like Mortal Kombat 2, which I loved to play in arcades. Also, Sindel and other characters making it more like Mortal Kombat 3, another favorite (also is like games in the middle of the Mortal Kombat series, but I never played those so the characters are new to me). MK2 was more innovative at the time, but I enjoyed 3 just as much in the 90s.

To get to the point I loved that this game came out in October. That fact and the hype made me pull the trigger. Do I think it was hyped? It was. Is it a good game? It's a fantastic game. However, due to the fact that I got MK 11 for maybe $9 with all content and MK 10 for about $5 or less with all DLC, I don't see how NRS enjoys turning it around and charging extra for the game, DLC characters, and a ludicrous price for the expansion.

I paid $70 for the game, bought the first Kombat Pack and kamoes for a very stingy discount, and now my pockets and wallet are in the same place I'm in with Street Fighter.

Mortal Kombat 1,1971870,172478914,"The Story mode is probably the best part as it still has a solid story, but don't expect The Last of US 1 or anything its a 7/10. The problem is everything else, there is a lack of game modes, there are less characters than MK 9, 10 and 11, the customization is also lesser. I don't particularly like the addition of cameo characters, they do add another layer of depth for the game play but for most people I have spoken with they not a great addition, maybe at the higher levels of play people might like them but casuals either forget they exist of just use them as combo extenders. The long combos are still here but the tools at your disposal for defense are terrible compared to the systems in other fighting games right now. I dislike that the only way to brake out of a combo is to use your partner and that uses all of the special power, leaving you defenseless if you fall into another combo in the match. they made the grab counter a 50/50 chance for whether to press XY or AB. The point is that in this game offence is way more favored than defense which makes it feel very casual. it is less of a back and forward fight between two characters and more of ""Its my turn to do my combo"" than ""Now it's my turn"" most of your skill comes from your ability to start the combo, after that it is mostly memorization. If you like the MK franchise you will probably like this game as well, as a fan I would give this an 8/10 due to the lack of game modes and the predatory monetization with meaningless rewards. As a casual gamer I would say that its more of a 7/10 because the meat of the game is much less than in the last few games, I still think that MK10 felt better to play. MK1 is at its most enjoyable if you stick with it for a long time and master it, but then again I just think that there are a lot of other games that are more fun to master.

1. when doing a combo breaker after sitting in a infinity combo the fucking combo breaker never works literally i put my controller down after getting spammed by a scorpion,the mf that can turn into a fucking lizzard and the bitch that screams and hits me with her hair but no dont get me started about the new fucking charater that hasnt been in a mk game since fucking mk9 or 8 yea the blue and yellow mother fucker with the whips you pussy ass players that sit there doing the infinite spam with the whipping i hope you go hang your self im so serious... i hate you
2. im sitting here trying to play the fucking game and either it crashes,takes 10+ years to load into towers or gay ass invasions or trying to play versus but no it takes 10 seconds to load into the store of mk1 quick as shit right??? dude i kid you not it makes me do the little shader thing or wtv and it damn near takes 40 mins to just load into the game... or get into a versus and it fucking crashes i have a pretty decent pc not the most expensive cause no offense im not a loser so ion see the worth of buying a high grade pc jus to play shitty mk1 so yea theres that lol.. 
3. the invasions suck ass like i hope who ever decided to add invasions and not crypt go to hell im so serious i hate you and i hate how boring and soulless the invasion is... the crypt was so much fun and didnt feel like i was sitting there jus pressing up left right and down after kicking a AI's ass for a 10 second match, dude the maps are lazy as fuck too johnnys crib jus has random mfs jus doin shit in there and ur jus walking around ur own crib going dot to dot to conclude on this the invasion sucks ass and you brain dead fucks dont play your own game and it shows this game shouldve never been a thing fr cool story which takes roughly maybe 5hrs or less but maybe its just me the mf game was lagging and freezing so much and glitching omfg the non loading floating heads and bodys were my favorite in the final fight hmm.. but anyways i got sidetracked yea it took me 20+ hrs cause it took forever to get throught a cut scene and god please dont skip them it will make it worse either you dont want to skip the cut scene and the fucking game will literally go ahead and skip it for you or when you try to skip the long boring stupid cut scene it will literally freeze or not skip the cut scene so im sitting there jerking off to a blank screen of the mk1 symbol.(im sorry i shouldve made the story a seperate point so sorry!) 
4.grinding in this game dont feel like a grind tbh? if that makes sense its boring asf like i said im mindlessly jus doing towers, the fake ass crypt and playing the cancer called versus... the game is boring love the mid ass collabs too i guess? homelander is cool and same with peackeeper but those said playable people are lowkey cheese and boring asf to play, same with kameos i think kameos shouldve never been a thing... kameos suck but ya i know its something diffrent but i want to fight by my self not have to be spammed by my opponent using a kameo jus to keep me frozen in air or jus sitting there helpless. 
5. like i said these are my opinios i will gladly say i suck at the game but ive been playing since mk 7 i love mk but half of the charaters feel useless without the ""right"" kameos? some cant be used right without a certain combo player and i find that very odd. 
conclusion- i hate this game i have tried to give it a chance but no ive spoke to others and watched vids they all say the exact same things im saying... mk1 is terrible and i wish i could get my time and money back cause i was actually happy asf when i saw it on sale and got it i was feening for a fighting game but this shit belongs to be drowned in acid..
