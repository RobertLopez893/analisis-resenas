[i] I have 100% completed this around 2017, around Patch 1.2. Then 1.6 was released, and I noticed that it was gone in my Completionist Showcase. [/i] 

I’m kind of shocked that I did not review this perfect game before, as I definitely enjoyed my time playing and returning to this game. I have been thinking about how great Harvest Moon's NYE Festival at the Summit was, and the fact that CA has added something akin to it, yet in a much harder way, is [i] Perfection. [/i] Winter 21, Year 7 is the day I achieved it, with no Joja services used!

The community is thriving (Shoutout to Wand of Sparking for getting me to try it to begin with), the developer is one hell of a guy, listening and interacting with the very same community and constantly giving us more updates while ignoring the very same community begging him to stop doing that and work on his next game. It's an amazing time with friends, I'm sure.

But, that said, it is not for me. I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys to lose themselves into hours of a calm, methodic RPG/Farming experience.

I started playing Stardew Valley “just to see what the hype was about.” That was 1 weeks ago. I haven’t seen sunlight since.
What was supposed to be a relaxing little farming sim has completely hijacked my life. I told myself I’d play for an hour before bed. Next thing I know, it’s 4 a.m., I’m in the caves again. My crops are perfectly watered, my animals are brushed and loved, my spouse brings me coffee every morning, and somehow this pixelated valley has become more real to me than my actual responsibilities.
The addiction is unreal, I cry real tears when my favorite chicken gets eaten by a wild animal because I was too busy fishing at 2 a.m. 
There is no endgame. There is only perfection percentage slowly creeping toward 100% while my real-life social skills atrophy. My friends text me and I reply “sorry can’t talk, it’s the night market.” I’ve spent actual money on multiple copies just so I can co-op with myself on different devices. Send help. Or more cauliflower seeds.
10/10 would abandon all adult responsibilities again. Grandfather’s ghost knew exactly what he was doing leaving me that cursed farm. Best worst decision of my life. If you value your free time, run. If you want to know true happiness (and mild sleep deprivation), welcome to Pelican Town. I’ll save you a spot at the saloon.

Stardew Valley,413150,209572145,"I was dead set on not playing this game for years, simply because I hate the graphic style. I am not a ""retro pixels"" kind of girl. However, I let myself be convinced when me and my boyfriend were doing long distance, so that we could build something together. Partly because we play vastly different games in general, but also because I do love a good city builder and farming sim. It was not love at first sight in any way. I had tried a few days earlier, but I do not do well with sandbox games, and get annoyed with having to figure stuff out..
As you can see though, I now have almost 450h in the game, so it won me over in the end. I did need the co-op mode to get into it, but it is a very lovely game to play together with a partner or friend. I am currently knee deep in trying to get a perfectionist run, though I absolutely did not make it easier for myself by choosing the mountain farm. I do love the challange, but at this point it gets very grindy, and I can only play 2-4 days in one go before getting tired of hunting Pepper Rexes in the dessert mines, or trying to find the right ores to ship. I have also completely given up on the prarie king ;) 

This is a long AF comment on a game for no other reason than to say that you should try it. But perhaps with a friend who has some experience in the game, and also, keep a tab on the Wiki open.

Stardew Valley,413150,209552796,"Never before has a game so completely engrossed, stressed, and rewarded my mind quite like Stardew Valley, though it's method of doing so is likely to vary in reflection of it's player. Stardew provides a simple basis initially - farming crops, selling them for cash, and then choosing to spend it however you see fit. But then the question is, how far do you go? Which crop is most profitable per season, and how many can you reasonably maintain over their growing period? Do you perhaps find a different activity more interesting, farming not your taste? Well then, that works too - dedicate yourself to catching high-quality fish found in only select waters, or optimise exploration of the forests for mass foraging of berries and fruits. Got more of a combative nature? Take to the mines, fighting through monsters and exhaustion levels to plumb the depths for valuable treasures. Bit of a homebody, looking to relax? Build relationships with the people around you - learn their interests, their dynamic schedules, complete requests and favours. Expand your house, indulge in interior design, live in luxury. Purchase animals, process their goods over the long-term, and then sell them for ludicrous prices. Maybe get married, have a kid or two - or don't, and instead pledge your love to the profit margins instead.

I have multiple farms - solo and multiplayer - and it is truly super chill no matter what mode I play and whom I play it with. I can already tell this version is going to have MANY more hours than the amount I  have at the time of review. There are nights where this is all I play and don't realize how late it is / how long I was playing for.

Be creative and do what you want! There are also a million mods with which you can play around - there's even a BG3 mod!!! 

I hate that you have to play the whole day (around 14 min) for your progress to save, but this makes it even more addicting. Each time your character goes to sleep, you say to yourself ""just 14 more minutes"". The only people I don't recommend this to are the ones with addictive personalities. It's really hard for me to be consistent with anything for more than a few days, but this game got me hooked instantly and it still hasn't let go after a few months.

Stardew Valley,413150,209354053,"The game is great, I particularly like how generous the game is with the timing of which you choose to do things.
Generally speaking, you can ""finish"" the game at any point in time, year 1, year 2, year 7, doesn't really matter!
The game doesn't rush you and lets you take your time at your own leisurely pace, which i think really does help the game have a nice relaxing charm that you can always come back to and reliably make you more relaxed!
The npcs are all quite charming and have pretty interesting dialogue and stories (Not counting post marriage shane)
So far, the main issue I find myself facing in this game is that the later content tends to feel quite annoying when factoring the lack of an armor system or some kind of defense against attacks until WAYYY later into the game, and how much more dialogue could've been given to the residents of stardew valley since it gets repetitive if you've played for a while. But, thankfully these are not issues that take away from the game's main selling point which is it's farming and community! Both are quite lovely and I'm glad to say I haven't personally had a bad experience with the community!! Will continue to play this for quite a while! It's just so fun!

Stardew Valley,413150,209341765,"If Stardew Valley had been released when I was playing Harvest Moon 64 on my old CRT, I probably would have melted out of happiness. The way it almost magically reproduces the same feeling of walking into a tiny town where everyone has their weird things, secrets, and work hours that you wouldn't really believe... but still it feels like home is something unique to it. 

In my childhood, while playing Harvest Moon 64, I would get so excited with the moment of my first row of turnips that I could swear I was doing a sacred ritual. The music was calm, the villagers had just enough personality to intrigue my little brain, and the whole world was incredibly warm. Stardew Valley actually brings back that very emotional memory and it says, ""Hey, do you remember that? Let's do it again but bigger, deeper, and somehow more personal."" 

This game is more than just a farm simulator, the emotional aspect is its main feature. Every day is a small adventure: you could be mining, fishing, or running madly across town because you forgot it was someone's birthday and you want to give them a flower like a frenzied postman. The villagers are very real characters, in fact, they remind me of the old days when every heart event was like finding a new page of someone's diary. 

What about the nostalgia? It is there... very strong. Such moments like standing on your farm porch when it is raining or watching the fireflies lighting up the night are exactly the same as those long childhood nights spent trying to marry Karen or figure out what the heck Kappa really was. 

But besides being the spiritual successor of Harvest Moon 64, Stardew Valley is its mature, emotionally savvy, and endlessly attractive evolution. The game is not stuck in the past but it is still there to pay homage to that era. It is that warm feeling of belonging which you get to experience once again through this game... yet you can also have everything on sprinklers, become friends with a wizard, fight cave monsters, or turn your farm into a vineyard because you are worthy of nice things. 

To put it shortly if you were a fan of Harvest Moon 64 during your childhood, then Stardew Valley isn't just a familiar notion, it is like returning home after a long time and seeing that the porch light is still on.",True,4,4542

Stardew Valley,413150,209168555,"Even having been out so long Stardew Valley holds up. There's a good reason new farm sims are always advertised as Stardew but with ____. If you're wondering if it's still worth it to pick this game up when it's older now and so many new games have come out I'd day overwhelmingly yes. For myself as a long-time player picking it up again feels a bit like home and the modding community is HUGE if base game ever starts feeling a little stale. Stardew is overwhelming a labor of love and it shows in the best way.

The game is quite open ended even as farm sims go, especially in the very beginning. Some people find the lack of direction overwhelming, but I love the freedom of focusing on what I want to do when I feel like doing it, so keep in mind what kind of gamer you are. As an older game it lacks some of the really clean QOL features some newer cozy games have but never in a way I've found to be imperative.

I've sold my soul to the cultivation of my farm and my ever-growing empire of wine production. Cute NPC interactions and good story aspects. Finished the game, will play again... and again. I've already convinced several people to download and play this game.

If you like planning and organizing you will enjoy maxing out stats, developing farm layouts, and running for completion. If you are just looking for a cozy game, water your plants, go fishing, enjoy the town events, and Romance some NPCs. There are so many options and quests in this game that you can either finish in <2 years in game (with extensive planning and maybe even a spreadsheet or two) or you can still be developing your farm and making friends in year 5+.

Mod-Friendly game for graphics or functional mods (items, clothes, buildings). Co-op is also very enjoyable (runs well).",True,0,26180

Stardew Valley,413150,208963961,"Stardew valley is a relaxing game with no clear goals or directions
The game is very clearly an analogy for real life with all it’s systems mimicking a farm life
So if nothing interests you in it just for the sake of doing that something then the game won’t interest you
The one thing that stood out to me the most are the really short days and the even shorter shops opening hours
Which makes it so you kind of have to plan what you’re going to do the next day because often times if you don’t do that then you just won’t be able to do it because of the time constraints
Days being very short also makes it so you have to constantly be making new plans every few minutes which gives you a sense of constantly achieving something

The game also has a strong social element where you can literally marry and kiss some npcs (only those that are marked as single) and even player characters if you aren’t playing alone
For me the enjoyment would have to come from figuring out how to get as much money as quickly as possible which I didn’t get to experience since I was playing with someone who already had 150 hours in this game
I can name the following main gameplay reasons to play this game:
Figuring out how to get as much money as possible (and all the systems associated with this process, so treating the game kind of like Factorio)

“Social” element (interactions with 28 unique villager npcs which include but are not limited to talking, trading, helping, dating)
Collection/completionism (I have heard that the steam achievments in this game are among the hardest to complete due to how long that would take, and there is a museum with relic items you can find in the game)
You private property building/decorating (explanation probably not needed, I can note that this was the first time when I didn’t feel overwhelmed by my options)

Fishing (You may snicker at me for making this into it’s own category, especially since this doesn’t really offer anything objectively unique - this is part completionism, part money making and part helping npcs.
Yet I have seen fishing in almost every game I have played recently I start to suspect that there really is a demand for specifically “fishing” being in the game, which by the way while seems odd to me should be understandable. 
The fishing minigame in stardew valley itself is similar to other fishing minigames you have played, for example the Genshin one.) 

And lastly the cave/mining gameplay (it is the familiar loop of breaking blocks and killing enemies and finding valuable items from time to time, with the cave changing enemies and scenery every so often, making the player curious what the next biome will be like. This cave gameplay is fairly different from rest of the game which made it stand out to me.)
There were other gameplay loops like the incredibly challenging arcade minigames but I just didn’t consider them being a big enough part to include as a reason to play the game 
But yeah if you end up not liking any of these in the context of the time management element + the interactions with npc then you have no reason to like the game
But you will more likely end up enjoying one or more and enjoy this game!",True,2,448

There is a lot of player agency and nothing is forced onto the player, even farming. despite it being one of its main advertised features. Build a massive farming tycoon, mine rocks and ores to your hearts content, or fish for every penny, you can do whatever you want, whenever. 

You start with simple farming, then work your way to foraging, unlocking new areas that allow mining and dungeon crawling/fighting, to even exploring a whole new custom map near the end of the game. You are consistently hit with new content, new events, and new things to do. While it can be a little daunting or frustrating at times because of no explanation, when you do find secrets or figure out puzzles it's not just rewarding in dopamine, but you typically get unique rewards that make you more efficient.

Stardew Valley,413150,208900382,"One lovely golden autumn day I felt like playing something cozy for a change from action roguelikes and such. Stardew Valley was already in my library, but frankly I tried it before and at that time it didn't grow on me and I quit in less than a couple hours. But this time the mood was just right for countryside escape and do farming.

Needless to say that the game is charming and quickly sets you to the country life daily routine loop. I enjoyed the early game progression. Learning farming tricks and optimizing your returns was fun. I wanted to get sprinklers so bad, that became my motivation to go caving to get crafting materials. Fishing is lots of fun too when you get a grasp on that mini game.

The game unfortunately breaks the spell of peaceful country life, at least for me, and offers you industrial scale farming development as you get over a certain threshold of gold on your account. The crops yield enormous incomes, forcing you to do something else or don't, because you have all you need. Except new resources that you can find in new caves, which is the opposite of what I wanted when coming to play a cozy game.

One thing that bugged me the most in the game was the time limit. You have so much you can do during an in-game day, so as in real life. But it always kept me frustrated that I cannot fit farming, foraging and social quests in one day. So I eventually gave up and focused just on farming, occasionally going to caves and fishing, and I totally neglected all the social life aspect of the game. Though somehow I got married on that hippie artist girl.

Despite a few negative sentiments, I would say it's a great game. The endless sandbox game is not for everyone, but if you want to take a break an explore cozy games and some cottage-core aesthetics, you'll be treated with at least 40 hours of great time. I spent a bit over 80 hours in it, and lived up until mid-fall of the second in-game year. Built a huge farm, built max size house, got married, finished all quests in community center, became millionaire. But after I achieved all that I didn't have motivation to wait for certain someone to get to see me and evaluate my achievements. But it doesn't mean the game is bad, it's just the thing about sandbox games, you play it for as long as you need it.",True,0,5166

Stardew Valley,413150,208898101,"I've only played Stardew Valley for a couple of hours, and it's already been a journey! The game is incredibly charming, but I'm clearly a natural disaster when it comes to farming life. My first night, I lost track of time, got caught in the rain, and just... passed out right there on the ground. The next morning, I got a letter informing me that ""unconsciousness is dangerous"" and a bill for the emergency services that found me! I didn't even know that was possible. On day two, I was determined to clear the land around my house. I got a little too enthusiastic with my axe, chopped one too many trees, and collapsed from exhaustion right on my own doorstep. Cue another letter and another medical bill. My farmer is a liability, and I've earned more debt at this point. Despite my character's apparent death wish, I'm having a blast. The fact that the game has these funny, forgiving consequences for failure makes it feel alive and lighthearted. I'm learning to manage my energy and time, and the loop of ""work, nearly die, get a bill, repeat"" is weirdly addictive. It's a cozy, funny, and surprisingly deep game, even if my bank account in Pelican Town is already in the red. Can't wait to see what other trouble I can get into lol!",True,0,150

Use copper to upgrade tools, chop more to build coops. Use eggs as gifts. Unlock more recipes when you level up and makes friends. Several seasons later, you're managing several plots of land, have a kickbutt sword and are the proud owner of a pig named Gelatin.

The cyclical nature between different portions of the game keeps gameplay refreshing and progression constantly on the horizon as a motivation. It's a fantastic formula, and the developer has poured enough interesting items and areas to last you a hundred hours.

The challenges increase over time, and allows some change of focus as you go along. The core is the farm and local community though, and has so many nice touches in it.

The perfection ending is also a nice touch, with the mid-game 2 year evaluation also a good stopping point. Some games the ending is an anti-climax, but this one made it feel like you achieved something.

For new starters - play at your own pace, start off with farming just a small area for a few days as you get used to it. And do not sell the stone or wood you clear - you will need it soon!",True,0,19859

If anyone else does too, the game freezes after the timer ends and everyone must restart the day, losing all progress they may have made. Also, pleeeaasseee implement a quest marker! I'm constantly failing quests and wasting days because I can't find people, and as a new player I couldn't find my way around the town very well.  But those are really the only complaints I have.

I’ve been playing since it first launched and watching it evolve over the years has been nothing short of magical. What started as a charming farming sim has grown into a rich, expansive world that rewards curiosity, experimentation, and emotional investment.
The updates have been phenomenal. Each one feels like a love letter to the community. From multiplayer to new farm layouts, expanded storylines, quality-of-life improvements, and even endgame content like Ginger Island, ConcernedApe has consistently added depth without compromising the game’s soul. The 1.6 update in particular brought a fresh wave of excitement with new festivals, dialogue, and mod support that makes replaying feel brand new.
Replayability is off the charts. Every farm layout nudges you toward a different playstyle. There’s no wrong way to play and no pressure to optimize unless you want to. I’ve restarted countless times and each run feels distinct. The seasonal rhythm, the subtle storytelling, the freedom to decorate and design! it all combines into a game that never gets stale. <3",True,0,68001

Ingredients For the Pumpkin Pie:

    ▢ 1 9-inch Homemade pie crust , or store-bought, deep dish, unbaked
    ▢ 3/4 cup granulated sugar
    ▢ 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    ▢ 1/2 teaspoon salt

    ▢ 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
    ▢ 2 large eggs
    ▢ 15 ounce can canned pumpkin or fresh pumpkin puree
    ▢ 12 ounce can evaporated milk

Instructions
 

    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
    In a large bowl beat the eggs and pumpkin together.  In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves, and add to pumpkin mixture.
    Gradually stir in the evaporated milk. Carefully pour mixture into unbaked pie shell*.
    Bake at 425 degrees F for for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350° F; bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer, or until the pie is set. Check for doneness by giving the pie a gentle wiggle. The center may jiggle just a tiny bit. It will continue to set up as it cools. Or, it is done when a sharp knife inserted in center comes out clean.
    Cool completely on a wire cooling rack. Serve immediately with whipped cream and caramel pecan topping, if desired.

Stardew Valley,413150,208681428,"While my hour count is not a abysmal on here as it is on other platforms, I shall leave a review anyways. This was one of the first games I bought with my own money at the ripe ole age of 12. At first, I didn't enjoy it, I didn't understand it. Then I revisited about a year or two later and became obsessed. The consistent loop of farming, mining, and monster killing drew me in. The pleasureful grind sucked me into pure unbridled obsession. The multiple ways of approaching this game kept me coming. When I finally got a PC, the options just opened up. The amount of versatility in modding and creativity is captivating.
The romantic interests are all unique and have wonderful story lines. Each character you meet in this game has their own unique charm that anyone would keep coming back to. Not to mention the update support, with ConcernedApe consistently coming back despite working on another banger of a video game. This game fundamentally changed my life, it carried me through the quarantine, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you have the spare 15 bucks, please buy this game, trust me it's worth it. You can get hundreds of hours out of this game, even without going full completionist with the achievement and perfection. 10/10 love this game would recommend to anyone listening.

Stardew Valley,413150,208641746,"I've been playing Stardew for a long time now, both on Playstation and PC, and I gotta say it's up there in my favorite games. The vanilla gameplay's really fun, and modding is incredibly easy once you figure out the basics.

Pros-
-You can spend literal days of real time playing before you reach a peak, and even then, you can play infinitely longer
-Graphics are cute and insanely well made
-Each save can be completely different from the last, allowing for each replay to feel unique
-The music's a vibe, I mainly fish in the early game for money, and I'll end up just sitting there and enjoying the music while fishing. It really does help me relax
-Gameplay's a little repetitive at times, but overall I've never had any issues. In fact, in some cases, I think the repetition can be nice
-Multiplayer works great. I've probably got at least 5 multiplayer slots and have never had any issues with lag, frame drops, or any performance related things. At least to my memory.
-As mentioned before, modding is easy once you get the basics out of the way, and some mods are really neat. I personally recommend SVE since it adds a billion new things to do and a handful of new characters.
-Abigail.
-The town feels cozy. Plus, it's not too hard to navigate around the map, and even in SVE where a lot of locations change/get added, it still feels easy to figure out where you are at any given time

Cons-
-Early game's a bit of a chore. You're given 1 hotbar to work with, and your first backpack costs 2k gold. It's not hard to get that much, but you also have to factor in your other tools and crops.
-I know this one's technically optional, but the Introduction quest is just a pain to do. I'll spend like 2 days worth of time just trying to find every NPC to say ""hi"".
-Developers, let me date Caroline and my life is yours.
-I don't know if this is really a pro or a con, but EXP is... Interesting. You can theoretically play for as many in-game years as you want (to my knowledge anyway), but your skill levels cap out at 10. Meaning you could theoretically max out every skill by Year 1, and be stagnant for the rest of the game. I personally wish it was a bit higher to make up for the time you can play for, but I know some people would definitely disagree.
-Joja's entire existence is a con.

Overall though I can't recommend this game enough. I'd say once you hit Summer of Year 1, things really start ramping up. You'll usually have your backpacks, a good fishing rod, maybe your tools upgraded, and a good chunk of cash by then. If you play it right, playing with multiple people with a shared money load can even make things SO much better. Because you don't have to worry about ""wait you stole my crops that I paid for and planted"", because the money you get on return goes into your shared account anyway.",True,0,8473

3. last is the story. the story is amazing, you play as this farmer who lives in pelican town and is inheriting a farm from your grandfather. You have to restore the farm and make it your own.

It's kind of hard to put down. xD You only get roughly 20 min per in-game day, so it can feel frantic, depending on your personal playstyle/goals.

I first played stardew valley in 2019 on the switch for a few months straight, so it feels weird writing a review for a game I’ve already spent hundreds of hours on. I thought I would though, because even though I haven’t played it in years, I’m floored at how easy it was for me to get back into. I remembered where everything on the map was, along with most characters’ names, and what some of their favourite gifts were. I didn’t realise how ingrained this game was into my subconscious.
Even if I forget about it like I did before, I’m sure it will come back to me eventually. This game will continue to be a soft place to fall for the rest of my life",True,0,5781

Forget everything you know about farming sims being ""boring."" This game is a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated dopamine. It's the video game equivalent of a warm blanket and a cup of hot chocolate.

The Grind is... Actually Fun?

The core loop is genius. You start with a dump of a farm, overrun with trees and rocks. It looks like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie. But then you get your rusty tools, and the magic begins. ""Just one more day"" becomes your mantra. You'll find yourself saying, ""Okay, just gonna water my crops, pet my chickens, maybe go fishing... wait, it's 2 AM in-game and I'm risking passing out to catch one more carp.""

Before you know it, you're not just a farmer. You're a artisanal mayonnaise tycoon, a master angler, a legendary monster slayer in the mines, and the town's #1 matchmaker. The skill progression is so satisfying it should be illegal.

Content for Decades

The amount of stuff to do is absolutely bonkers. This isn't just a farming game. It's a:

· Dating Sim: Can you woo the goth elf boy or the moody writer? You betcha.
· Dungeon Crawler: The mines are no joke! Pack some snacks and a good sword.
· Town Restoration Project: Rebuild the community center and stick it to the corporate Joja Mart. Feels good, man.
· Fishing RPG: The fishing minigame is a whole vibe and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.

The Verdict: 10/10, A Perfect Comfort Game

Stardew Valley is a legendary indie gem, the kind of game you'll still have installed years from now. It's a world that feels alive, thanks to its charming characters and their own little stories. ConcernedApe, the solo dev behind this masterpiece, is an absolute GOAT for creating this and supporting it for so long.

TL;DR:
If you have even a single chill bone in your body,BUY THIS GAME. It's the ultimate palate cleanser, a time-sink you'll never regret, and honestly, cheaper than therapy. Just be warned: you'll start playing, look up at the clock, and realize you've been optimizing your crop layout for three real-life hours. Totally worth it.

Stardew Valley,413150,208410599,"Stardew Valley is pure comfort in game form. It’s relaxing, charming, and somehow endlessly addictive. What starts as a simple farming sim quickly turns into something much deeper — building relationships, exploring caves, fishing, decorating your farm, and finding your own rhythm in a peaceful little town that feels alive.

Every day in Stardew Valley feels rewarding. Whether you’re harvesting crops, mining for rare gems, or giving gifts to your favorite villagers, there’s always something satisfying to do. The pixel art is beautiful, the music is cozy and nostalgic, and the attention to detail in every aspect of the game is just incredible.

It’s a game that lets you slow down, breathe, and escape from the chaos of real life for a while. You don’t just play Stardew Valley — you live there. 🌙

10/10 — A timeless, wholesome masterpiece. Perfect for relaxing or losing track of time.

Stardew Valley,413150,208369997,"Stardew Valley has been my favorite farming game for a good five years now. Having played through a new save on Steam and almost reaching perfection again at the time of writing this review, it's just as calming, fun, and open-ended as I remembered. As a gamer with the attention span and general gameplay interests of a caveman, it's pretty crazy that something that appears so mundane and simple at a surface level is one of the most addicting things I've ever played.

This game has been around long enough that the best it has to offer has already been parroted by tons of people, so I'll try to keep the things I love most pretty brief. Progression is perfect and moves at a pace that's simultaneously slow enough that the game always always feels relaxing, yet fast enough that all of the seasonal content the game has to offer returns semi-frequently and it's not quite as agonizing if you accidentally forget to/run out of time to do something during a certain season. NPC townsfolk are designed great, having unique schedules and interests and pretty engaging storylines for the most part. There's a ton of ways you can make money, and with the right setup any of them can be extremely profitable, which makes the gameplay fundamentally super open-ended. That paired with the sheer diversity of things you can do in a single year cycle and the (SPOILER FOR ENDGAME AREA) [spoiler]giant distant island with a colossal amount of unique content you can access late in the game[/spoiler] gives this game a pretty insane longevity that provides hundreds of hours of engagement, and ensures that there's a dozen other projects you can focus on if you can't finish something season-specific.

It's been said by many already, but I can concur that this game has something for everyone. Tons of avenues of farming and ranching for whatever playstyle you have the most fun with, well-designed and fun combat that can be challenging but rarely feels like you're unfairly screwed over, open-ended building and different farm layouts that can allow for breathtakingly beautiful farms, tons of varied NPCs of different age groups you can choose to make friends with or pursue romantically (or not, you can be a sigma lone wolf too, with zero consequences), cross-platform co-op if you'd like to play with a friend or partner, Steam Deck compatibility (which I can't comment further on as I don't have one), and some fun lore that you by no means need to care about at all to enjoy the game but also adds some very welcome charm and mystique to the world if it does interest you, all for the frankly stupid price of only $15 USD. There are very few games that provide this level of content and quality with an indie pricetag, and it's fantastic that we have a charming and relaxing life sim in that boat, as a majority of them tend to lean towards being fast, fun, and high-octane action/adventure/platformer titles. 

There's a million other things to gush about, but I'll leave it at that so as to not spoil anything for anyone. It's worth mentioning I don't play with mods apart from a few small quality-of-life things, but a single browse through Nexus will make it obvious there's a pretty wild modding community working diligently to enhance the game even further. This game is an unbelievably good value for $15, even going on sale occasionally, and comes packaged with so much varied content it's highly unlikely you wouldn't enjoy the game (though I think it also does a good job playing enough of its cards in the first two hours that you'll know very well if this game simply isn't for you and you want to refund it). I can't do anything but strongly recommend giving Stardew a try. The amount of positive reception it continues to get almost a decade after release and its stagnant Overwhelmingly Positive rating on this platform says enough; this game is WELL worth your money.

There's genuine depth to explore, wrapped in this wonderfully cozy atmosphere that manages to be both contemplative and engaging without feeling tedious. What draws me most is the freedom; you genuinely control your path forward, choosing what matters to you. I grew up with the original Harvest Moon games like Back to Nature and Harvest Moon 64, and this feels like a spiritual successor that honors those classics while pushing beyond them.

What makes it special is how it balances competing moods: there's this inherent warmth and charm, yet underneath runs something more ominous and unsettling that lurks just beneath the surface that gives it quite the realism factor. That tonal complexity; cozy yet shadowed, welcoming yet mysterious, creates something that feels both comforting and genuinely unsettling at times. The whole experience carries this elegant equilibrium where no single element overwhelms the others.

Stardew Valley,413150,208311511,"This game is basically a warm hug in pixel form - the GOAT of cozy games that every farming indie title dreams of being. No timers, no pressure, just pure freedom to do whatever you want. It spoils you with little rewards, easter eggs, amazing soundtracks, and funny moments with its NPCs. Although there is an optional ""true ending"", you’ll always find a way to keep playing long after that. I have 900+ hours, and I still get excited whenever someone suggests playing it. Plus, it’s perfect to play with your partner or friends. Love it to bits!",True,0,59060
Stardew Valley,413150,208310579,"Stardew Valley is one of those rare games that just stays with you. I went all the way and 100%’d it, and for some reason I still open it from time to time — sometimes just to walk around and listen to the rain, sometimes to go fight slimes in the mines like it’s a life-or-death mission. There’s something therapeutic about almost dying to a dust spirit at 2 AM.

But what really sets the game apart is the people. The characters feel like they’ve got actual lives and issues. Abigail? Eats rocks and somehow makes it cool. Haley starts off like she runs a high school mean girl cult, but ends up surprisingly decent. Shane has the emotional range of an actual human being who's seen some stuff. They’re flawed in ways that make sense, and that makes Pelican Town feel incredibly real.

And then there’s ConcernedApe! one person making an entire game of this scale and heart? No cut corners, no cash grabs, no “season pass.” Just layered design, care for the craft, and free updates even years later. The guy’s a workhorse.

Oh, and one personal tip: Don't play it with your spouse. Stardew has a weird power. One minute you're just choosing which crops to plant, next minute you're low-key angry at your partner for messing up the chests. I almost got divorced over a virtual chicken coop. Not kidding.

All in all, it's calm, deep, and has more soul than most games released today. Easily one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in gaming.",True,0,2765

Stardew Valley,413150,208307194,"I still can’t decide if I’m playing a cozy farming game or slowly building a cult of villagers who love my mayonnaise.

You start off escaping the soul-crushing corporate grind to fix up your grandpa’s old farm—and suddenly you’re knee-deep in crops, fishing at 2 a.m., and crying because you missed the flower dance again. It’s wholesome, chaotic, and weirdly personal.

The magic of Stardew is how every little thing matters. You plant, water, harvest, upgrade, fall in love, mine until you pass out, then do it all again. The seasons change, your farm evolves, and somehow you start caring more about your pixel cows than your real-life responsibilities.

The villagers? Absolute characters. Some are sweet, some are disasters, and all of them will judge your life choices. But over time, you build bonds that feel real—and suddenly, giving Shane a beer every day feels like emotional support.

After 180 hours, I’ve got ancient fruit wine money, a wife, two kids, and still get excited when it rains.

The stamina bar and the timer mechanics are just too stressful for me. There are a couple other mechanics that compound this frustration. Like, I want to do good by my Grandpa (who is the one you inherit the farm from, who ostensibly comes back after your second year to judge how well you've done. But thinking about having a farm that makes him proud, and also about finishing the community bundles (which have many things that can only be done during certain seasons/conditions) makes me feel like I constantly have to meticulously plan out my week, making sure not to waste a single day. That kind of gameplay can be fun, but it feels at odds with the vibe the rest of the game is trying to curate.

It's not just the amazing pixel art, the relaxing music, the beautiful colors of everything, the changing seasons, the various crafts, the diversity of the gameplay. It's getting to know the villagers, their personalities, starting to get attached and love them deeply. Remembering their favorite dishes, their stories, discovering their heart events. It's helping your community, gifting your homemade products, loving your pets and animals, watering your crops, fixing the community center. It's reading too many Reddit forums, going everyday to the wiki, trying to get all the achievements, playing and laughing with friends, and finally succeeding at closing the hell of Joja. Playing Stardew Valley is really just like drinking a hot chocolate inside, watching the rain fall by the window.

The story itself isn't quite amusing, but the whole game has an energy that simply just drags you in. The whole concept of inheriting a farm in the middle of nowhere and deciding to go there moved by the feeling of emptyness in your life is already calling. Also, I love the friendship mechanics and the fact that you can marry the bachellors; although some 14 heart events are boring. Besides, some festivities or special events (like Christmas and The Egg Hunt) are really exciting because they are more interactive. I would like The Egg Hunt more if the locations of the eggs changed every year though.

However, I must say that the game gets kind of repetitive if you're playing alone. I highly recomend you to play online, it's more thrilling and you can't predict what will happen through the day. Also, the skull caverns are kind of boring (in my opinion), and for others is the thing they hate the most about the game.",True,0,4616

I met the villagers, got to know their likes and dislikes, their stories, and I became invested with the game. You could could virtually do everything from farming, fishing, crafting, exploring and mining caves, fighting monsters, etc. It has multiplayer, too.

Stardew Valley,413150,207840769,"Some people may have told you that Stardew Valley is a chill game about farming and making friends. Someone might have told you that this is an easy going, relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't normally play video games. Those people were wrong. Stardew Valley is not really a game at all; it is a mirror, reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition, and my own inability to escape it. 

At the time of this review, I have logged 400 hours into this game across platforms. I have completed the community center in it's entirety, and I have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency. I make millions of dollars every season, and, for good reason, l continue pushing just to see how grotesque my industrial landscape can become. I have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily in my personal quest for power. 

This game may be relaxed for some, but for me, it is war. There will be no item left unpurchased, no crop left ungrown, and no slime left unslain. I have become Death, destroyer of worlds. If you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power, this game is for you. If you just want to have a cute little farm and role-play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy, this game is also for you. If you value your mental health, or maintaining productivity, this game may not be for you.

It can be exciting and chill, adventurous and calm, the things you can do in the game can fit whatever vibe you're feeling on a given day. Truth be told, I actually learned a lot of life lessons in this game. Call me crazy, but I feel like God used this game to teach me the value of patience, and the value of what you can get done in one day. You can't do everything you want in one day, but you can get one step closer to your goal by taking just one more step everyday. This is a game where you get what you put in.

This game took Harvest Moon out into the woods, and absolutely took it to school.  It's very telling that while that series manages to vomit out a new entry (Both from the original developer, and the cheap knock-offs using the brand name) they can't even touch the success of the brave little indie game that could.

Janky? Yes. 
Fun? Without a doubt.

Btw around mid fall time you'll get invited to a grange where you gotta bring the best of each category, like fish, cooking etc. you need to bring 9 items to show off for a competition that gives 1k points, thing is you need about 2k points to get the stardrop from the festival shop. ( It increases your max energy by 34 points ) so vote for green on the bet wheel....i got it first try...that and another easy stardrop is getting to level 100 of the mines. remember to do missions for the guild and they will occasionally give you stuff worth alot of gold like the insect head weapon i believe.

First up, as a full-time engineer in a high-stress job, this is a relaxing video game. It's so relaxing that it often helps me destress after long workdays and really helps me chill out.

Second, it's beautiful. The pixel art is enjoyable to look at.

Third, it's got a ton of replayability. It doesn't really ""get old"" like lots of other games once you've beaten them.

And finally, there's a massive amount of mods to improve the experience. After you've beaten the game a couple times, try out the mods! There are a ton of amazing mods that let you add all sorts of great things into the game. Can't really ask for more!

Stardew Valley,413150,207667835,"Stardew Valley is one of those rare games that feels both peaceful and deeply rewarding. What starts as a simple farming simulator quickly becomes a story about community, growth, and finding meaning in the little things. Every player’s experience feels personal — whether you’re rebuilding the town, raising animals, fishing at sunset, or getting to know the charming, sometimes mysterious villagers.

The pixel art is warm and nostalgic, yet full of life. The soundtrack perfectly matches each season, adding a gentle emotional rhythm to your farm’s daily routine. What really stands out, though, is how much freedom the game gives you. You can focus on crops, mining, fishing, crafting, decorating your home, or even starting a family — and none of these paths ever feel forced.

It’s easy to lose hours just living in this world. The balance between calm routine and slow discovery makes Stardew Valley not just a game, but a comforting escape. Even after hundreds of hours, it still feels alive thanks to updates and a passionate community of modders.

Verdict:
⭐ 10/10 — Stardew Valley isn’t just a farming game. It’s a peaceful journey about life, choice, and finding joy in simple things. :3",True,1,4373

Stardew Valley,413150,207585463,"One of my favourite games of all time and one of a handful of games I have played at least a few hours of every year since I first bought it. I own it on 3 platforms. 

There's something unbelievably comforting about Stardew Valley. The bright and happy pixel art and cozy setting evoke a feeling of home. But Stardew Valley sings because it's systems are deep and satisfying. Farming is the most basic building block of the game, but the mining, crafting, foraging, fishing and combat systems all offer a great distraction from the sometimes repetitive nature the game. 

The fantastic world and playful character writing are a big part of what keep me hooked on this game too, and decorating my house in weird and wonderful ways is as much of a joy 4 years after getting the game as it was the first time I booted up.

""you spend your days working a nine-to-five at joja corporation, slaving away in identically lifeless cubicles, until one day the stress of modern life starts to weigh too heavily on you. you sell your house, quit your job, and buy a one-way bus ticket to a little town in a little valley smack-dab in the middle of a big nowhere. Your only belongings are five hundred gold, an empty backpack, and an overgrown, rundown farm that your grandfather left you in his will.

There is no drug that can recreate the pure euphoria of opening a window, cozying up in a blanket, and sipping some delicious tea (or other warm drink of your choice) while enjoying the gorgeous scenery this wonderful game has to offer. There's so many things to do; Farming crops is a great way to make money and all, but for being classified as what I would call a ""farming game"", there's so, so much more to do than simply farm crops and take care of your animals. Relationships with characters [b][i]**really**[/i][/b] feel like they matter, but even still, the game doesn't particularly FORCE you to engage with barely anyone.


[h3]Do you like dating simulators?[/h3] This game has a mechanic where you can marry certain characters, all with their own little playable stories and cutscenes that make them feel so much more real and alive. 

[h3]More of a fighter?[/h3] The caves (and later on, the Skull Cavern) are packed with enemies to fight and treasures to find. 

[h1]Do you enjoy giving as much money to a soulless, greedy corporation that you want to distance yourself as much as possible from?[/h1] [h3]Well... you're not gonna fuckin' believe this...[/h3]

[h2]There is genuinely something in this game for anyone and everyone.[/h2] Anyone who classifies this as ""just another farming game"" is missing out on so much in the indie video game scene. The art and sprites are gorgeous, animations are smooth and clean, but not so much so that it feels weird for a pixel game. 

Frankly, I don't rate games very often, but I just can't help myself with Stardew Valley. I've played countless, countless hours on my switch, from the toilet to the Doctors office, its so easy to just pull out and play whenever, wherever, for however long.

Puan: ★☆☆☆☆

İnceleme:

Stardew Valley, çıkmadan önce çok fazla övgü aldı ve ben de bunları duyunca gerçekten heyecanlanmıştım. Ancak oyun, beklentilerimi karşılamaktan çok uzak kaldı.

İlk başlarda her şey güzel gibi görünüyor; kendi çiftliğini kurup, tarım yapıyor, köy halkıyla tanışıyorsun. Ama ne yazık ki, oyun hızla monotonlaşıyor. Aynı görevleri sürekli tekrar etmekten sıkıldım. Tarım, balık tutma, madencilik... Hepsi çok tekrarlayıcı ve zamanla gerçekten sıkıcı hale geliyor. Oyunda ilerledikçe aynı şeyleri yapmaya devam etmek, o kadar da ""keyifli"" gelmiyor.

Bir diğer sorun ise karakterlerin derinliğinin olmaması. Herkesin temel bir kişiliği var ama bu pek bir anlam taşımıyor. Diğer karakterlerle etkileşimde derinlik yok, ve ana hikaye de oldukça sıradan. Yani, bir noktadan sonra köy halkı sadece ""yapman gereken şeyler"" gibi hissediyor.

Görsel olarak da, o kadar da özel değil. Piksel sanatı sevmeyen biri için bu oyun gerçekten zorlayıcı olabilir. Ayrıca, sürekli aynı şeyleri yapmak, oyun boyunca görsel çeşitliliğin neredeyse sıfır olmasıyla birleşince, her şey birbirine benziyor.

Zamanın nasıl geçtiğini anlamıyorsun, ama anlamadığın şey aslında sadece sıkıldığındır.

Çiftlik yönetmek ve kasaba hayatı kurmak istemiyorsanız, bu oyun size hitap etmeyebilir. Benim için zaman kaybıydı.",False,0,151

Ah well. Super fun game. if you like a game where you can slowly work towards multiple goals at once without any real worry about missing something for ever because the seasons start to fly by one you find a few things that you really enjoy doing.

Stardew Valley,413150,207422393,"I don't think a game has ever had such a hold on me (except maybe Skyrim).

Stardew Valley is THE GOLDEN STANDARD for the modern farming sim/RPG for many reasons: the gameplay, the setting, the story, the characters, the music... I lost myself in Pelican Town a couple of hours every day after work for weeks on end.

I thoroughly enjoyed my progression from a humble gardener to a multimillionaire in my road to perfection in over 4 in-game years. It's filled with small victories, every new fish you catch, every profession you unlock, every build you commission, all the expansions and installations in your fields, your artisan enterprise, your social life, this game rewards you and encourages you to go further all the time.

I have a few nitpicks, nothing deal-breaking, just little ""ugh"" moments I experienced here and there:

- Forced socialization:
Why do I have to max-heart everyone in town? Plus, the friendship decay (especially with animals) is too punishing in a game aspect that's already too grindy. If that hoe Marnie sold an autopetter, that would be great. And btw, why are romanceables all young adults? We need an option for Zaddy Gus and muscle mommy Robin.

- Inventory clutters too fast:
Especially with the various qualities of fish and forageables. If tools didn't take up inventory space, that would be a huge QoL improvement (in 1.7 Eric, please?).

- The dinosaurs:
Pepper Rex are the only element that broke my suspension of disbelief. They feel so out of place in this picturesque rural setting. An eyesore.

- Unconsequential story elements:
Like the mayor’s affair and his golden statue. Robin's unhappy marriage. Community center re-abandoned right after restoration...

So, after reaching perfection, unlocking all 49 achievements (I totally didn't mod the 2 cheevos for Journey of the Prairie King),

my final rating for Stardew is a resounding, unapologetic 19/20. Stardew is a lifestyle!",True,0,9533
Stardew Valley,413150,207421737,"a really cozy game made with lots of love
the soundtracks are amazing and just so relaxing to listen to,even after so many times of listening to them
i think the start of the game might be the more boring and tedious part,which might be why some players dont like it.i didnt enjoy it at the start etiher ,but sticked around and ended up loving the game.

the start might feel directionless and no fun ,but after that stage fun begins,wherther its progressing the game making money,completing missions,getting to know the villagers,finishing the community centre or catching every fish.which are all suprisingly rewarding and fulfilling.

end game might not be for every one aswell as not everyone is good at decorating and designing ur house and farm,im def not great at it etiher but still had lots of fun  trying to do so.I did get bored after 142 hours and 100% completing it tho.

overall:absolutely recommend it,stick around and play the game abit more and you would start enjoying it,money worth it.

Stardew Valley,413150,207323705,"Gameplay: 9,5/10
A cozy farming sim that has everything you need. Animals, crops, you can go to the mine or fishing, build relationshups with the townfolk and even adopt a cat. The latest update added a bunch of really enjoyable content without any extra cost, which is highly appreciated. One of the few games that actually got me hooked for more than 48h consecutively
Cost: 10/10
For the small amount that this game costs, I can just recommend to try it. I am 282 hours in, the mod-community on here is huge and I didn't even do the challenges provided by the community besides my achievement hunt. With more than 280h I still got enough content to cover another 300+ without additional cost
Achievements: 8,5/10
Overall the achievements are awesome. You got a little grind here and there, coordinate your farm and tactics and even have little sidequests to do so it doesn't repetitive easily. Would be a 10/10 if it wasn't for the achievement down below

Hardest achievement: ""Fector's challenge""
This achievement ruined my last few moments in the valley. As the developer said himself, it is more difficult than it should be. With the savescumming method it is easier, but not fun in any way",True,0,16959

Stardew Valley,413150,207316938,"The game is cute in the beginning but quickly becomes a repetitive slog. 

The game does not explain its mechanics at all, it depends completely on fan made content to make it playable for a new player. 

Fishing is the best example of course, fans of this game lol about how hard fishing is. But it's not only hard mechanically, in the beginning I couldn't understand what I was supposed to do at all. So if you stop fishing completely, Willy comes to you and asks you why you aren't fishing. If you say it's too hard, he gives you training rod, says he will give you a lesson. That just gives you one fishing level for free but still doesn't explain what you're supposed to do. It's like the dev clearly sees that fishing is just a mess in this game but decided to just shrug it off.
And you need to fish to progress the game...
This makes the game unbalanced because you progress all the other skills too fast compared to fishing, 

Then there's making friends with characters... It's mostly giving them gifts, doing their quests and hoping for a cut scene...
And finding these people in time to give them a gift without the wiki is near impossible - and you need to chase them around to give them gifts and finish their quests.
Ah, the mini quests, they start on the day you pick them up and you need to chase the character to close them on the next day, So you need to pick them up early enough to finish them on the same day you pick them up and then chase down the character who requested it the next day. 
There's so much timed stuff to keep track of, it gets stressful very quickly.
  
At least I lucked out with romance, chose Maru on looks alone in the beginning when I knew nothing about her because she's the only one that doesn't look like an anime reject (also funny how most of the romance options look like anime rejects and there's not a single Asian person in this game). Her personality is very pleasant and her story is neat. 

If someone is starting with this game, my one tip is ignore chasing the quests early on. It will only frustrate you.
And to never pick up Robin's hardwood quest before you get a horse. The horse lives in this sad shoddy stable that costs a lot of resources and he makes the game much more playable because you move faster on it. Hail the horsey.

Also, if you upgrade your foraging skills to collect double and then to get highest quality, piggies are the best. 

I'm a completionist, so I will try to restore the community centre but I might give up because of the fishing eventually because after days in game and hours irl of doing the fishing minigame, I still barely understand the mechanics of it, youtube tutorials help very little. 

Generally, if you think a farming game should be you running around all over the map trying to complete anything and forgetting 10 other things, and you find that fun, then this game is for you.",False,3,8668

Stardew Valley,413150,207314929,"48 hours in. I started this with friends thinking it’d be a chill side game between tanking RPG sessions while I wait to upgrade my system. Now I’m managing crops, exploring caves, occasionally fighting monsters, and somehow invested in which villagers get my gifts. 

Linus is basically the MVP of the valley, lives in a tent, survives on berries, and somehow can afford to pay me three times the market price for a diamond. What a guy. 

It’s calm when it needs to be, chaotic when it’s not, and has that perfect “just one more day” loop. You still get combat, loot, and progression, but it never feels stressful, just rewarding in a different way than my usual gory RPG grind.

Didn’t expect a farming sim to grab me like this, but here we are. I hope it keeps getting updates, because I’m not done.

Stardew Valley,413150,207313173,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ An Absolute Masterpiece — Stardew Valley Shines Brighter Than the Sun!
Stardew Valley is, without question, one of the most heartwarming, beautifully crafted games ever made. From the very first moment you step off the bus into your overgrown little farm, the game wraps you in pure comfort and joy. 🌾✨
Every element of Stardew Valley feels lovingly designed — the soft pixel art, the gentle music that shifts with the seasons, and the sense of freedom that makes every day feel like your own story. You can farm, fish, mine, fall in love, build friendships, decorate, and explore — all at your own pace. There’s no pressure, just a cozy rhythm that makes time disappear in the best possible way.
What makes it even more special is how alive the world feels. The villagers have unique personalities and stories, the festivals bring everyone together, and the changing seasons make the valley feel magical. There’s a deep sense of progress and reward, but also a warm, steady comfort that’s rare in games today.
Whether you’re chasing perfection or just watering your crops with a cup of tea in hand, Stardew Valley gives you peace, purpose, and endless joy. It’s more than just a game — it’s a place that feels like home. 🏡💚
10/10 — A timeless, soul-soothing adventure. I can’t recommend it enough.",True,0,24789

Stardew Valley,413150,207313064,"(Played on Steam Deck)

I tried. I really did. But this one just didn’t steep right.

Okay, confession time: I jumped into Stardew Valley because of the hype. It felt like everyone was talking about it - the cosy community’s ride-or-die farm sim. So I gave it a proper go. In fact, I played 35 hours. I kept dipping back in, hoping for the moment it would “click.” But honestly? That moment never came.

The core gameplay loop just didn’t land. I found myself stuck in a grind that felt more repetitive than rewarding. And while I normally enjoy slower, sim-style games, something about Stardew felt off. The farming was fine - but it never sparked joy. The rhythm of the days turned into a bit of a chore… and not the comforting kind.

I struggled to connect with the characters. Their storylines felt generic, and I couldn’t get invested in the town’s social side the way so many others seem to. I know the heart of this game lies in its relationships, but I just didn’t feel much of a reason to care what anyone was up to.

As for the visuals - I get the nostalgic appeal of the retro pixel art. But personally, I found the world a little gloomy and lifeless. That’s totally a taste thing, and I respect the creative choice. It just didn’t do much for me.

I really did try to find positives. If nothing else, Stardew Valley helped pave the way for other life sims to build on the formula and evolve it. I’ve definitely seen this idea pulled off in ways that resonated with me more. That said, the community around the game is lovely. I met some genuinely kind people who encouraged me to keep going when I was struggling to stay interested.

My biggest frustration? That nagging feeling like I should be enjoying it. Like I was missing something magical everyone else could see. But the truth is - sometimes even the most beloved games just don’t click. And that’s okay.

Final Thoughts:
I fully respect how much this game means to others. It clearly struck a chord with thousands of players - and that’s great. But if you’re after something more emotionally engaging, visually vibrant, or relaxing without the grind, there are plenty of other cosy games that might be a better fit.

Stardew Valley,413150,207251174,"tl;dr: probably a great experience for people with more patience than me.

i really wanted to like this game, a lot of my friends love it and it'd have been a nice, calming change of pace from games like DBD or CS2 that just raise my blood pressure. sadly, it ends up being a little ""too relaxing,"" i.e. the slow pacing really hinders the amount of enjoyment i could get out of it. you might argue that since i only have a total of 4 hours playtime i couldn't have gotten to the fun parts of the game yet, but for me the fact i played this game for 4 hours without getting to the fun part kind of reaffirms the issues i have with the pacing. if i *did* get to the fun part it wasn't fun enough for me to pick up on it.

that said: if you love farming games, if you love building relationships with NPCs over longer periods of time and if you love slow-paced progression that you can enjoy with your friends, this is the game for you.",False,3,254

Stardew Valley,413150,207243508,"🌾 Stardew Valley — The Game That Feels Like Home

I didn’t expect Stardew Valley to mean so much to me when I first started it. I thought it was just a farming sim — something casual to relax with after work. But the more I played, the more it felt like a quiet, healing world I could escape to.

There’s something incredibly peaceful about the rhythm of this game. Planting crops, fishing by the river, hearing the soft rain, or just walking through town at sunset — it all makes me feel calm in a way few games ever do. Every little thing feels meaningful, even the smallest progress.

What surprised me most is how real the villagers feel. They’re not just NPCs — they have their own stories, moods, and struggles. Sometimes when life feels heavy, I’ll log in and just talk to them, check on my animals, and end the day watching the stars from my farm. It’s weirdly comforting.

I think Stardew Valley is more than a game. It’s a reminder to slow down, to breathe, to find joy in simple things. It helped me feel grounded again — like I could pause the noise of real life for a while and just… exist peacefully.",True,0,2737

I’ve spent 170 hours in Stardew Valley, and honestly, I could easily spend 170 more. This game is pure magic. It starts off simple—you inherit a rundown farm and move to a quiet town—but it quickly becomes so much more than just planting crops and feeding chickens.
The freedom to play your way is what makes it special. Some days I’m deep in the mines chasing rare loot, other days I’m fishing by the ocean just to hear the waves. I’ve built up my farm from scratch, turned it into a thriving little paradise, and still find new things to tweak and improve. There’s always a new goal to chase, whether it’s completing the Community Center, unlocking new areas, or just decorating my farmhouse to perfection.

The characters in Pelican Town are surprisingly deep. You start off thinking they’re just quirky NPCs, but as you build relationships, you uncover real stories—some funny, some emotional, some unexpectedly dark. It makes the town feel alive, and I genuinely care about these pixel people.
The seasonal changes, the music, the festivals, the little secrets hidden throughout the game—it all adds up to an experience that’s cozy, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. Even after 170 hours, I’m still discovering new details and trying out new strategies.
If you’re looking for a game that lets you relax, explore, and build something meaningful at your own pace, Stardew Valley is it. 

It’s not just a game—it’s a place I love coming back to.

Honestly, stop scrolling through the bad reviews and just buy the game — it’s amazing. 10/10.

I’ve been playing for about seven years now, and I still absolutely love it. Sure, I despise the Skull Cavern (who doesn’t?), but that’s what multiplayer is for — dragging a friend along to share the pain.

I have zero complaints. Updates roll out flawlessly, and on the rare occasion something goes wrong, it’s fixed almost immediately. You can tell this game was made by someone who genuinely cares. Eric didn’t do it for money or fame — he built something that people could truly enjoy. And it shows.

Thank you, Eric. I’ve never found another game quite like this one, not even among the imitators. It might not be for everyone — but honestly, it kind of is.

Stardew Valley,413150,207138902,"If you are going to use a wiki as a list of what to do, it's fine. Just don't look for in-game clarity as to what to do. 

If you are looking for a build a house and have a farm sim it's okay. 

Don't expect much of a challenge other than keeping the list of things to gather/find straight. The combat in the game is fairly trivial.

The order of operations isn't forced so you will find yourself doing things out of order and it makes the experience more very poor (read: annoying/frustrating) when you discover something that would have made a prior experience more enjoyable. 

The ui is ""okay"".  alignment issues seem to happen periodically and mouse click actions by default never seem to quite be what i expect (even after 10 hours). maybe it's too many years of diablo? 

i fished once and was like ""i don't really enjoy this"" and then discoverd it's like a major part of the game.  

still better than many other games but it clearly wasn't designed with me in mind.

Stardew Valley,413150,207000578,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ – “Touch Grass: The Game”

Stardew Valley isn’t just a farming sim — it’s free therapy disguised as pixel art. One minute you’re planting parsnips, the next you’re knee-deep in an emotional connection with a fictional villager who hates mayonnaise. It’s cozy, it’s wholesome, and it somehow makes watering virtual crops feel more fulfilling than most real-world jobs.

The atmosphere is immaculate. Birds chirping, seasons changing, the satisfying “plink” of a watering can — it’s like a warm hug from the universe. Every day feels like a tiny story, whether you’re fishing at sunrise or accidentally gifting someone literal garbage because you misclicked (we’ve all been there).

The storytelling is sneakily deep, too. Beneath the cutesy exterior is a world full of small-town drama, emotional arcs, and weirdly relatable life lessons. It’s wholesome without being cringe, emotional without trying too hard — and that’s rare.

That said, the “ending” (if you can call it that) doesn’t exactly blow your socks off. It’s more of a soft fade-out than a mic drop, and once you’ve done everything, there’s not a massive reason to replay from scratch. But that first playthrough? Pure, serotonin-fueled magic.

10/10 – Would ignore real responsibilities to harvest virtual blueberries again.",True,0,25608

I’ve been lost in Stardew Valley since 2020, and I’m finally scribbling this review because I noticed it’s missing one, and everyone’s grabbing those sparkly Steam awards :D 

This game was my ultimate happy place, a perfect blend of chill farming, cozy vibes, and small-town charm. I’ve dated every villager (yep, I’m a serial heartbreaker, no regrets, cheated my way through all the heart events), popped out a gaggle of pixel kids, and built a farm so massive it’s practically a veggie empire. 
Oh, and I conquered Journey of the Prairie King without a single death ;)
I’ve done every quest, maxed every skill, and adored every second of tending my adorable animals, petting my pup, and making my farm a cute masterpiece. The music’s a warm hug, the festivals are pure joy, and there’s always something new to uncover like secret caves, villager gossip, or just rearranging my flowerbeds. No stress, just pure bliss. 

[b] Pros [/b]: Romanced everyone, farm’s a stunner, Prairie King slayer, kid central, all the cozy feels.
[b] Cons [/b]: Nada
[b] Recommendation [/b]: Grab it, grow it, love it

Stardew Valley,413150,206937681,"You abandon your soulless corporate job and moved to a dilapidated farm outside a town in the idyllic countryside. Normally this would be a terrible career move, but you are confident you can become a millionaire selling potatoes and eggs and that your 401k was useless this whole time. There is an inordinate amount of eyeglasses in the river. The town drunk somehow hasn't had her CDL revoked. The girl with purple hair eats rocks. The only thing that makes the goth kid happy is frogs. The owner of the local general store is a turd. There is no school, but somehow there is funding for a museum. The ghost of your dead grandfather threatens to haunt you for years. Somehow, farm implements made from gold have more tensile strength than iron. Steel hasn't been invented yet. Every week, without a word, you hand every resident of the town a fresh jar of mayonnaise. Somehow, this makes nearly everyone in town fall in love with you. An unbreakable bond of friendship forged in the fire of eggs and vinegar with you, a mysterious condiment tycoon wearing a trash can lid on your head.

Every aspect of this game blends together to make it feel like you, yourself are actually the farmer. It is a great way to escape the reality that is life. You are free to build your place however you want. The possibilities are endless. The limit to what you can do is your imagination. Single-player or Multiplayer You will always find yourself racing to see how fast you can complete the museum, community center, and reach perfection. I've had plenty of fun times with friends or by myself. Multiplayer lets each individually play how they want. You have the one who dives into the mines the first chance they get. You have the fishermen who fish all day. You have the farmhand. You have the one who does it all! The one who befriends all the villagers. At the end of the day though you all come together and take a step back to reflect on the progress you made. This game will always remain in my list of games to play.",True,0,32505

Stardew Valley,413150,206889312,"Stardew Valley is the most comforting and rewarding slice of life game I have played. It looks simple at first but it unfolds into a deep and surprisingly rich experience that keeps pulling me back day after day. The loop is perfect. You start each morning planning your tasks, check the weather, water your crops, feed your animals, and decide whether to head into town, explore the mines, go fishing, or work on upgrades for your farm. Every minute feels purposeful and the small choices you make add up over time in a way that is both relaxing and satisfying.

The world is packed with personality. Pelican Town feels alive, with characters that have routines, birthdays, personal stories, and heart events that make them feel like real neighbors. Building friendships is not just a checklist. Conversations change with the seasons and with your relationship progress, and gift preferences actually make sense once you learn more about each person. Festivals break up the calendar with fun activities and unique rewards, and they give the town a real sense of community.

The progression is excellent. Early on you struggle with energy and time, but small upgrades like better tools, sprinklers, kegs, and barns open up new possibilities. The Community Center bundles give you clear goals and push you to try every part of the game, from foraging and fishing to cooking and animal care. If you prefer a different route you can partner with Joja and rebuild the town a different way. By the time you reach late game you can automate huge parts of your farm, breed animals, create artisan goods, decorate to your taste, and still find reasons to explore.

There is a surprising amount of adventure. The mines and later combat areas add risk and reward, with meaningful gear upgrades, gems, and resources that feed back into crafting and farming. Fishing deserves a special mention. It can be tricky at first, but once it clicks it becomes a relaxing way to spend time, earn money, and fill out collections. The soundtrack ties it all together with gentle themes that change by season and by area, and the pixel art is gorgeous with cozy lighting, weather effects, and the best autumn vibes in any game.

Quality of life is strong. The game teaches you gently and lets you learn by doing. The day timer and energy system encourage planning without ever feeling punishing. Crafting menus, chests, and tool upgrades make routine tasks smooth, and there are lots of small touches that show real care, like being able to reorganize buildings, move sprinklers, or label storage in your own way. Performance is rock solid on both keyboard and controller, and co op is a blast, with shared goals and a nice division of labor between farming, mining, and town errands.

What I love most is the freedom. You can focus on crops and artisan goods, become a fishing expert, design the prettiest farm layout, chase every collection, speed run profits, or take it slow and just enjoy the seasons. There is always a new project within reach. One week I am remodeling the farmhouse and landscaping with paths and fences. The next I am grinding for ore to upgrade sprinklers or trying a new crop rotation. Even after hundreds of days there are secrets, new cut scenes, hidden areas, and rare items to discover.

If I had a gentle warning, it is that time management can be tight early on and the fishing mini game can feel tough until you get a few skill levels and better rods. Stick with it. Those systems start to feel great once you settle in, and the sense of progression is worth it.

Stardew Valley is cozy, generous, and endlessly replay able. It respects your time, rewards your creativity, and makes even the smallest accomplishments feel meaningful. I love this game and I cannot recommend it enough.",True,0,4150

Stardew Valley,413150,206881583,"This review is for the people for whom hearing ""it's just a game"" in relation to a title they enjoy is baffling and even a bit insulting. 

Stardew Valley worth every single moment I spent in it and many moments that I haven't (yet, perhaps). Best enjoyed with a (close) friend or a partner (especially if both of you have never played it). A huge, beautiful world with a plethora of things to do, accompanied by stunning music. There's no deadlines, only dates. Everything you've missed can be done the next year, and waiting for it you'll find so many new enticing things that you'll get carried away and miss the day you needed again, and you won't be even mad about it. The amount of mods (especially large, rivaling some games' DLCs by size and quality) can make you spend multiple thousand hours in it. Whether you are a relaxed played who cherishes their square of pumpkins and waters them by hand, or a raving capitalist seeking to become the local Scrooge McDuck, or something in between (like me, who had multiple spreadsheets balancing the beauty and completeness of the farm with the profits to be had), you'll love it. Give it a go. And check out Nexus Mods. This seems to be the only game that can be called truly wholesome down there.

In some ways it's pretty standard - you inherit your grandfather's farm and need to find a way to make a living in a small town. Similar to rune factory, this game has a combat system as well. 

What makes it special, I think, are all the fun things you can explore like figuring out the secret notes. I've played a fair bit, and poking around a discussion board on Reddit I was still finding out things I'd never seen before!

Stardew Valley,413150,206777993," “Why I Stole Caroline from Pierre” – A Stardew Valley Love Story 

When I first arrived in Pelican Town, all I wanted was peace. I was tired of the noise of the city, the endless grind, the feeling that life was passing me by one cubicle at a time. I came here to find something simple: dirt under my nails, sun on my face, and maybe, if the stars were kind, a few friendly faces.

I didn’t expect her.

The first time I stepped into Pierre’s General Store, I was just looking for parsnip seeds. But when I saw Caroline, everything else faded. Her laughter filled the room like sunlight through dusty windows, her green hair catching the glow of the afternoon light. She smiled politely, asked how the farm was going, and I forgot how to speak for a moment. I told myself it was nothing, a harmless crush on a friendly villager.

But days turned into weeks, and soon I was visiting the store every morning. Pierre would brag about his prices while I pretended to browse, sneaking glances toward the sunroom where Caroline sipped tea and read quietly. Sometimes she would look up and smile, and the world would stop for a heartbeat.

She loved the simple things: tea, fresh flowers, the sound of the rain on the roof. I started bringing her little gifts, a daffodil from my field, a cup of green tea I brewed myself, a diamond when my mine trips were lucky. She always thanked me softly, her voice like spring wind. I told myself it was innocent. It wasn’t.

The town began to whisper. Pierre grew colder. But I couldn’t stop. When she invited me to share tea with her one morning, I knew I was lost. The scent of jasmine filled the air as she spoke about her dreams, how she once wanted to travel, to see the world beyond Pelican Town, before life settled her into routine. “Sometimes,” she said, “I feel like my heart belongs to another season.”

That was the moment. The one where everything changed.

It wasn’t sudden; love rarely is. It grows slowly, like the crops we tend, roots deepening quietly beneath the surface. Every glance, every conversation, every shared silence made it harder to ignore. I wasn’t just the farmer anymore. I was the person who reminded her what it felt like to dream.

Pierre tried to fight it. He slashed prices, gave me dirty looks at festivals, and once, I swear, sold me defective fertilizer out of spite. But love doesn’t need discounts. It needs honesty, patience, and the courage to follow your heart even when it leads somewhere you shouldn’t go.

The night she came to my farmhouse, the rain was pouring. She stood at my door, soaked but smiling, eyes shining with something I had never seen before. “I can’t pretend anymore,” she said. “I’ve lived my whole life for others. I want to live for myself now. With you.”

That’s how it began, not with fireworks, but with quiet truth.

Now, years later, Caroline and I live together on the farm. She tends to her tea saplings in the mornings while I work the fields. In the evenings, we sit by the fire, sipping wine made from our first harvest of ancient fruit, listening to the soft hum of crickets outside. Our two children chase fireflies by the pond, their laughter echoing through the valley. Sometimes, when I see her watching them with that gentle smile, I realize that this life is everything we ever wanted.

Pierre still runs the General Store. We visit him sometimes. It’s awkward, but there’s peace between us now. Maybe he understands. Maybe he always did. After all, the heart isn’t a store. You can’t own it, you can’t stock it, you can’t sell it. You can only nurture it, and hope it blooms.

And Caroline? She’s still the same, kind, warm, and a little mischievous. Every spring, she plants new flowers around our home, and every year, the valley seems just a little brighter.

I came to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the world. I found love instead.

10/10. A game about farming, friendship, and finding the courage to chase the love you never expected. 🌻💚

I thought this was a cute farming simulator.
Next thing I know, I’m:

Talking to a wizard who lives in a shack.

Giving rocks to my crush until they like me.

Fighting slime monsters underground for “ore” (aka emotional damage).

Watering crops at 6 AM like it’s a full-time job — without the pay or benefits.

I went in thinking I’d play “one day.”
It’s now Year 4, my grandpa’s ghost has judged me, I married a guy who keeps giving me driftwood, and I’ve somehow memorized everyone’s birthday.

Stardew Valley,413150,206736830,"This is my 3rd time buying this game. Went from Switch -> Xbox One -> and now Steam. I recommend this game to quite literally everyone. Usually when recommending games to others, there is a lot of context needed - who are you? What games do you already like? What are you in the mood to play right now? But this game man... it's truly for everyone. It was confirmed for me when my younger brother got his girlfriend, who isn't into games at all, to play co-op with him. Their experience playing together late-nights ended up becoming one of their most cherished memories of the relationship. It was (and still is) very heartwarming to see.

This game is filled with charm. Everything from the peaceful OST and environments, to the vibrant pixel-art, to the characters of the NPC's makes this game feel alive. You can truly feel the passion that went into this game that was developed by ONE man. That's the most inspiring part of it all. This game was developed solely by a single dev who wanted to make something great. He struggled with making it. That it too so much time. That friends and family were wondering what he was doing with his life. And he started to question himself at times and get depressed. But he stuck with it because he believed in what he was making. I mention all of this because if you know this while you are playing, it will add to the introspective nature of this game. To the inspiration it provides you. Yes, somehow left-clicking your mouse so that you can axe down a tree in a pixelated game will inspire you. Idk what it is. The game is just very meditative, almost like the music, the enivornment, the core gameplay forces you to zone out a little and self-reflect/day dream as you play. [b]Which leads me to my biggest advice for new players[/b];

[b]Play this game without any help from online or without any background podcasts on[/b]. Immerse yourself in it. Play with no distractions. You don't have to rush anything in this game. Min-maxing takes the fun out of it. Just explore and do things at your own pace. Enjoy the nice OST and let it sweep you away into that self-reflective state it puts you in. Forego your podcasts while you play so that your mind is not focused on something. Again, this game is very meditative. You don't want to be in a focused state of mind, but instead be gently swept into that daydream-like state the game puts you in. Because of that, I think the best way to experience the game is handheld. So on your Switch or Steam Deck. Lying down in bed playing this game is a divine experience. I'm writing this review on steam, and while I'm still having a great experience playing this game, so far the steam/PC experience has been my least favorite. I'm always too tempted to alt + tab to look something up, to put a podcast on, to break my immersion from the many distractions on PC. It takes away from my own discovery and autonomy in game. I end up just following the meta-approach to something instead of through my own trial and error. So again, I implore you to play this game at your own pace, without any distractions. The game is designed really well in that it's intuitive - you will understand fully the mechanics of something new it throws at you. And it will drip-feed you more content as you engage with the world and characters more. When you do this at your own pace, it feels rewarding as the world opens up.

Have fun playing this beautifully crafted game.",True,0,1829

For a game that came out almost 9 years ago, it is still incredibly popular, and so many people are still playing it. The base game itself is amazing, with its relaxing gameplay, charming world, and endless things to do. What makes it even better are the mods. Even though the game is already great, mods can add new content, improve quality of life, and make gameplay smoother. Some of my favorites are the auto fisher for fishing and the elevator mod for the Skull Cavern, which help with some of the more tedious aspects. Overall, Stardew Valley is timeless, enjoyable, and keeps players coming back again and again.",True,0,22662

It’s a cozy, charming experience that invites you to slow down and relax. There’s always something to do, some new corner to explore, or a hidden detail to discover. Each system is simple on its own, but layered together they form a surprisingly complex and satisfying whole.
Even the NPCs, who seem simple at first, start to feel alive—they have their own routines and stories to tell. It’s a game that doesn’t rush you, and that’s its strength. Highly recommended—especially with friends.",True,0,2552

4 years have passed. There are over 50 Fish Ponds covering my once fertile land. The smell must be so horrible but I have long lost my sense of it, seeing only rewards from the myriad of aquatic life trapped in their perfect environments earned from their own strange desires. One fish desired diamonds in order to expand its family, another even wanted bombs. The humblest asked for but a few cave carrots.

>Foraging
>Fishing
>Farming
>Mining
>Combat
Above is half of the game's fun mechanics. For me, I like fishing and you might like it too, and if not there's otheres too choose from as well. After all its not limited to planting and selling crops as the game depicts outside of ones knowledge.


Anyways, its cool and kind of laidback, if you want a game  to keep you occupied for a long while. its this one, give it a chance and lets stardew on the valley together </33

When we first moved in together it would be me playing a game on the couch, her reading a book, both of us immersed in different worlds. We were doing the same things over different mediums. I wanted a game to play with her and i saw Stardew Valley on Xbox Gamepass. I downloaded it and after some slight convincing she played it with me and HOLY COW! What started as a fun game we could play together when i got home from work turned into her playing stardew across 3 different devices, building new intricate farms on every single one, delving into the deepest levels of the mines and skull caverns, sailing to ginger island and speedrunning through the walnuts.

Stardew Valley,413150,206502065,"Stardew Valley: A Review by a Totally Normal Farmer Who Definitely Hasn’t Named All His Chickens After Historical Figures

Let me start by saying this: I booted up Stardew Valley to relax. A cozy farming simulator, they said. Plant some parsnips, raise a cow, marry the nice goth man. Next thing I know, it’s 2am in real life, I’m covered in virtual slime juice, and I just divorced my pixel wife because she insulted my crystal layout. And I’d do it again.

This isn’t a game. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a spiral. It’s emotional blackmail wrapped in pixel art and fiddle music.

You Wake Up With a Hoe and Depression

Your grandpa, who suspiciously dies off-screen, bequeaths you a chunk of land so overgrown it looks like a bomb went off in a forestry exhibit. You arrive in Pelican Town with nothing but a few tools, a dream, and the naïve hope that you’re about to live a quiet life.

You are not.

You are about to enter a wholesome-yet-chaotic capitalist nightmare where time is a lie, your neighbors have unresolved trauma, and the local wizard is peeping on you through the bushes.

Farming? Oh You Sweet, Simple Fool

On day one, you plant some parsnips. On day two, you realize you forgot to water them. On day three, a crow eats your only remaining hope. You panic, run to Pierre’s shop, and drop your last 60g on turnip seeds like a Wall Street trader who just learned about crypto.

A week later, you have four different crops, a mild gambling addiction thanks to the egg festival, and a schedule that revolves around when Pam goes to the bar.

Farming becomes a religion. The greenhouse is your temple. The sprinkler is your god.

The Mines: Where Happiness Goes to Die

Oh, you thought this was just a farming sim? Cute. Here’s a pickaxe. Go fight the horrors beneath the mountain.

The mines are where Stardew Valley stops pretending to be cozy and starts playing the boss music from your anxiety. Bats shriek at you. Slimes drop from the ceiling. You’re one swing away from passing out and waking up with a bill from the local doctor and a heartfelt letter about how they ""found you in a puddle.""

Somewhere around level 70, the walls start looking like they’re made of meat, and you begin to wonder if the loot is really worth it. It is. It always is.

Romance: It’s Complicated™

You can date everyone. Literally everyone. The doctor? Yup. The bartender? Sure. That weird guy who eats rocks and lives in a tent? Romantic options abound.

The courtship system is charming in the way that giving someone 57 daffodils in a row until they love you is charming. ""Here, have this mayonnaise. Marry me."" That’s romance in Pelican Town.

But once you’re married? Oh, that’s when the emotional game begins. Your spouse might cook for you, or they might rearrange your entire home while you're out fishing. Sometimes they water your plants. Sometimes they just stare into the fireplace like they know what you did in the Skull Caverns.

You can even have kids! Or don’t. The game doesn’t care. They’ll just stay toddlers forever, trapped in an endless loop of building blocks and existential dread.

JojaMart: Satan, but With Membership Perks

If you’re a good little farmer, you’ll restore the community center with love, hard work, and ancient fruit wine. Or… you can sign your soul over to JojaCorp for 5,000 gold and a soul-numbing corporate lifestyle that makes you feel like the villain in a Hallmark movie.

And guess what? The sprinklers are cheaper.

Capitalism wins again.

Fishing: The Real Dark Souls of Stardew Valley

I have conquered dragons in Skyrim. I’ve beaten Bloodborne. But nothing prepared me for Stardew’s fishing minigame, where you must wrestle aquatic nightmares with the reflexes of a caffeinated hummingbird.

Fish will taunt you. Leap. Dive. Fake you out like they’re being controlled by a bored esports pro.

You’ll finally catch a legendary fish after 40 attempts, and then forget to empty your inventory and watch it disappear while your character stares blankly into the lake like a traumatized war vet.

Decorating: Martha Stewart Meets Hoarder Simulator

You will spend five hours trying to place your scarecrow “just right” while ignoring the fact that your house is full of unprocessed pine resin and your barn is on fire.

There are rugs. There are plants. There are entire cottagecore blogs dedicated to optimal chicken coop feng shui.
At some point, you’ll stop chasing profit and start chasing aesthetics. You’ll weep when your bee houses aren’t perfectly aligned. You’ll spiral because your kitchen table clashes with your wallpaper.

You will become the monster.

Music, Art, and Emotional Damage

The music? Hauntingly peaceful. Until it triggers a memory of when you passed out at 1:59 AM because you were too far from home and the spirits were “very displeased.”

The art? Pixel-perfect joy, bursting with personality. Every season brings color shifts that make you feel like you’re living inside a Studio Ghibli film... that occasionally asks you to murder shadow beasts for coal.

Final Thoughts: I Wasn’t Prepared

Stardew Valley is not a game.
It’s a perfect storm of comfort, chaos, and compulsive time management.
It’s a soft blanket… with a knife hidden in the folds.
It’s where you go to escape capitalism, and end up selling jam at a 900% markup like a fruit-flavored war criminal.

You will laugh.
You will cry.
You will try to make friends and end up giving someone a rock and getting hated forever.
You will forget who you are outside of this farm.
You will click ""sleep"" and mean it with your whole heart.

I started playing this game when I was barely sentient in this world, and now as I am older, I have realized that some concepts in this game are very relatable to not just me, but other people as well! I only hope for a few things: our children to grow up, date nights with spouses, potentially getting older as the years progress (?), and maybe anniversaries or a features to replay some heart cut scenes. All in all, it's a game that is not very rushing and is very patient. With almost 2,000 hours in Stardew Valley, my first ever spouse being Alex, I have still not reached perfection yet, but that's okay!

Stardew Valley,413150,206474914,"I’m not a big fan of pixel art games, but Stardew Valley completely changed my mind. It’s one of those games that you start just to “see what it’s about,” and then somehow you’ve been farming for five in-game years and know every villager’s birthday by heart. It’s honestly the definition of relaxing, the kind of game where doing absolutely nothing still feels productive.

The chill atmosphere is what makes it shine. You can farm, fish, mine, decorate your house, or just vibe with the townspeople. Getting to know each villager is surprisingly fun. They all have their own stories, quirks, and moments that make Pelican Town feel alive. There’s something really cozy about logging in just to give gifts or check what everyone’s up to.

That said, going for the achievements can be painful. Some of them feel like they were designed to test your patience, specially the fishing and crafting ones. It doesn’t ruin the game, but it does make the “relaxing farm life” turn into “spreadsheet simulator” real quick if you’re chasing 100%.

Still, Stardew Valley is easily one of the best indie experiences out there. It’s peaceful, addictive, and way more emotional than it has any right to be. Even if you’re not into pixel art games, it’s worth giving a shot, you might end up loving it as much as I did!",True,1,4050

Stardew Valley,413150,206322196,"For years, I saw Stardew Valley on every storefront and ""must-play"" list. And for years, I scoffed. A farming simulator? A ""cozy"" game? I live for the punishing, precise combat of Dark Souls, the brutal mastery of Sekiro, the unforgiving worlds where a single mistake means death. I thought a game about planting parsnips and talking to villagers would be a waste of my precious gaming time. A shallow, casual experience that couldn't possibly offer a challenge or, more importantly, respect my time.

I have never been more wrong about a game.

Out of sheer desperation for something different, I finally downloaded it. The first day was confusing. I was just… watering plants. Cleaning up my farm. It felt slow. But then, something clicked. I realized the challenge in Stardew Valley isn't about reaction times or pattern memorization. It's about optimization, strategy, and long-term planning.

The Skull Cavern isn't the Catacomb, but descending its floors with bombs, staircases, and a well-timed sword swing against a thos anoying flying skulls head!.. it requires a level of preparation and resource management that any Souls veteran would appreciate. Trying to maximize your farm's gold-per-day output is a complex puzzle. Managing your energy, time, and resources each day is a constant, engaging challenge. This game isn't ""casual""; it's just that the difficulty is cerebral, not reflexive.

But the true masterstroke, and what made me feel the most foolish for dismissing it, is how profoundly Stardew Valley respects my time.

In Stardew, every single day, no matter how you spend it, is progress. Did you spend the whole day fishing? You leveled up your skill and earned gold. Did you just wander around talking to people? You’re closer to unlocking a new cutscene or a community event. Did you pass out at 2 AM because you lost track of time in the mines? You lost a little money and maybe an item, but you kept all your ore and your combat experience. The game doesn't punish you for failure; it gently nudges you to do better next time. It’s a game that understands that your free time is valuable and ensures that time is never truly wasted.

I now see the ""coziness"" not as a lack of depth, but as a brilliant design philosophy. It’s a world that wants you to succeed, to build, and to belong. It provides a sense of accomplishment.

I wish I hadn't let my own gaming snobbery keep me from this masterpiece for so long. I was the one being casual in my judgment, not the game in its design.

So, to anyone viewing this, especially my fellow masochists who live in Lands Between and Lordran: give this farm a chance. You might be surprised by the deep, strategic, and incredibly rewarding experience that lies beneath its peaceful surface.

And to ConcernedApe, the developer: Thank you. Thank you for creating a world that is both challenging and kind, and for showing this hardened skeptic that a game doesn't need to break you to build you up. An absolute masterpiece.

Stardew Valley,413150,206308328,"Preheat & Prep
Preheat your oven to 160°C (320°F).
Line an 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang to lift the brownies out later.
(Using parchment prevents crisp edges!)

Melt Chocolate & Butter
In a heatproof bowl set over simmering water (bain-marie), melt the chocolate and butter together.
Stir gently until smooth, then remove from heat and let cool slightly (about 5 minutes).

Mix the Sugars & Eggs
In a large bowl, whisk together granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla for about 2–3 minutes until slightly thickened and glossy.
You don’t need to overmix — just until the sugar dissolves and the mixture looks creamy.

Combine Chocolate & Egg Mixture
Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the eggs while whisking gently. Mix until smooth and uniform.

Add Dry Ingredients
Sift in flour, cocoa powder, and salt.
Fold gently with a spatula — stop as soon as no dry streaks remain.
(Overmixing creates air, which can make crisp edges — so keep it gentle!)

Bake
Pour the batter into your lined pan.
Tap the pan lightly on the counter to remove air bubbles.
Bake for 22–25 minutes, or until the top is just set and a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).

Cool Slowly
Let the brownies cool completely in the pan at room temperature — at least 1 hour.

Each season brings new activities, events, and surprises, keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging. The townspeople are full of personality, and forming relationships with them adds emotional depth to the experience. Whether you're playing solo or with friends in co-op mode, Stardew Valley delivers a wholesome, rewarding experience that’s easy to pick up and hard to put down.

Stardew Valley,413150,206087482,"I picked this game up originally back in, like, 2018 or 19 or whatever, and thought it was pretty awesome save for the terrible combat.

Fast forward to now, and it's gotten even better, with so many quality of life improvements and extra content that you'd be insane not to capitalize on the sheer bang for your buck. Except for the combat.

Some games will give you the power fantasy of carving through demons, some will have you leading armies and out-smarting your enemies. This game gives you the ultimate power fantasy for a man in 2025: living off the land with a beautiful wife and kids. And the only demons you're fighting off are A) the evil Amazon stand-in and B) the stupid effing flying enemies that drag the game to a halt as you stand there knocking them away and waiting for them to bounce back like the slowest, most boring game of paddle ball in the universe. Combat sucks.

There'll inevitably be that time where you realize that you're 90% done with the game, even if that 10% will take a hefty while to achieve, and that'll drag down your mood. But it'll take you _quite_ a while to get there, and it's all worth it for that sense of accomplishment. And if the problem is, ""Aw, I was hoping there'd be just a *little* bit more,"" then I'd say, after forty-something hours, that's a freakin' accomplishment.

If I had only _one_ piece of feedback...we could *maybe* have enemies die in less than twenty hits. Maybe. Definitely. Absolutely. Enemies shouldn't take nearly twenty hits to kill with the highest-level sword in the game. We ain't here for the paddle ball, Eric - we're here for the *literally everything else*. The likable npcs, the cute gals, the mysteries, and the soil. And fishing, sometimes. When I'm in the mood. I'm not often in the mood. But we're getting off track.

Stardew Valley,413150,206063751,"Ah, Stardew Valley. An absolute classic. You can probably infer from my hours played that I really like this game. Stardew has it all: cozy farming simulator, incredibly rich world building and npcs who will have you obsessed if you pay attention to what they say, lots of room for personal design and creativity, a plethora of choices to make, and genuinely challenging gameplay in many areas. 

I will caution new players to not overdo their play time. Although stardew is a wonderful game, it is a little too good at getting you hooked. Try to limit your play sessions to 2-3 hours max, if not less. Otherwise, it is VERY easy to burn out early. And that sucks for everyone, because you will definitely not make it long enough to experience all the game has to offer if you don't pace yourself. 

My other criticism is mostly around the late game experience. Opportunities like Ginger Island and the Skull Cave mean you do have things to do around year 3/4, but it's quite difficult to really dive into those, because at that point in the game you have a very active farm that needs daily tending to. So you're constantly jumping back and forth and not doing either the best you could. 

I finished the skull cave but mostly ignored Ginger Island at this point in the game, and instead opted for mods, which has been a great decision for me. There is a very thriving modding community on this game and you should totally check it out even as a first time player. There are simple mods out there that won't interfere with your ""genuine"" experience, but will just get rid of some minor annoyances that don't do the game any good. 

If I could add anything to this game it would be making spouses and children more helpful. I am begging concerned ape to let us assign chores to our spouse and kids, once they're grown. I would also love if the children were a little bit more anything. They barely qualify as npcs right now in my book. 

I still recommend this game, which is very close to my heart!!",True,1,11619
