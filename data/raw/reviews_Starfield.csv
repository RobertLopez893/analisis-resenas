The one thing that I really liked and sunk way too many hours in was the ship building. Surprisingly good, definitely wish they flushed it a bit more and got deeper into it. Everything else falls flat unfortunately. It feels like I was egged along believing things might expand and get more interesting but it doesn't. Every quest eventually breaks and soft locks itself and I lose hours of progress. I've never played a game that made me feel so much pain for no reward. Listen...

The criticism is mostly valid. This game is compared unfavorably to many other, more focused games that do the same things but better. But by bringing together so many different things, Starfield creates a bigger, more immersive world. So many people say they played like 200 hours and ""beat the game."" BS. They barely started the game. There is so much to do and see, and so many different ways to go about it.

Starfield,1716740,209743880,"Been playing since launch. It's a fun game to play, even for a game that feels made by committee and plays it safe, undercooked, and generic with certain of its quests and characters. Environments while planet hopping have left me taking it slow to enjoy the sights and sounds (music at the forefront of that). The shipbuilding is easy to get lost in and the ships are fun to play with as your home out in the stars (if you like the light base building, there's some of that too). Flying them is enjoyable. I like the planetside traversal, it just needs better tuning and variety. Photo mode provides lots of fun moments. The gameplay pace generally is slower but I like it for that. For every lacking aspect of the game, another aspect is done decently or well and the experience tallies up to worthwhile.

It's a solid 7/10. Not terrible, not amazing. If the things I thought were negative got fixed up it's an easy 8/10 (and if it got some major additions there's room for a 9/10 game in here).

This game will make you invest and will never, never give back to you. Play AC Odyssey for fun exploration. Play the mass effect trilogy, or Andromeda even, for fun sci fi stories that make you go whoa. Play Hades, or Wanderstop, or Greedfall, or just play Skyrim again. Don't buy this game. It's not fun.

Starfield,1716740,209634813,"i love this game, and while i understand some criticism from concerned fans of bethesda games (myself included), the game, at its core, is a good ol’ classic bethesda game. it’s the same formula from skyrim and fallout, but it’s just in space.
i understand that the procedural generation, having multiple planets to go to, plus the loading screens for every landing and travel, has its flaws — especially when you mix it with bethesda games — and in my opinion, compared to the single-focused worlds from previous entries like skyrim and fallout, it might have a tiny negative impact on your gameplay pace.

but still, i can imagine myself getting past that and pouring the same amount of hours into this game as i did into fallout and skyrim, if time permits. the writing style is the same as the other games in the franchise. bethesda’s focus point has never been great writing for their stories, but rather a beautiful open world, role-playing, and astonishing world-building — which they did one hell of a job at again.

the skill-check dialogue is a bit weird, because the dialogue options it presents for persuading a character are so goofy that most of the time they don’t make sense or feel realistic XD. even more so than fallout 4.

now to the good things:
one thing i appreciate the most is the new tab for items you recently picked up. because oh boy, how many times have you picked up an item and had no idea what it was? now this new tab has you covered.

another thing that i should have mentioned at first is that you can fast-travel around locations within the city through your scanner by simply pressing “e” on that specific location’s icon. you can’t imagine how much this improved the pacing of the game for me.

the inventory management is a hell of a lot better than in previous games. i did criticize the questionable UI design, but the inventory, on the other hand, takes the cake for me. you can actually sort your items by their names and weights, which you couldn’t do in other bethesda games without using a mod.

the story so far is perfect. i like the different factions in the game. i’m 120 hours in and i still haven’t touched the main quest (classic bethesda game way of playing XD).

TL;DR:
starfield is a good game — just what you’d expect from any bethesda game you’ve played. there are some questionable design choices, but they don’t hurt your experience at all. just try the game yourself and don’t bother with the negative reviews.",True,4,10410

I've played through Starfield when it first came out and got through the main story. At the end, I had felt nothing but regret and disappointment. Yet, I finally  found a mod collection that rectifies this.

""Odyssey - A True RPG"" -- A Nexus mod collection of 230+ mods.
I'm 30 hours in and this collection sets itself apart, with it being meticulously balanced for extended gameplay, and enjoyment.

Starfield,1716740,209600257,"I'm going to start this off by saying that in the time since this game has come out, I've put 103 hours into it. You would think that means that I'd like it and highly recommend it, but that's not the case. Honestly? The game sucks. It's largely empty and boring, nothing ever really feels all that interesting, the choices they made with the story were bad, the world building is bad, just the whole thing is bad. I run it with probably over 100 mods just to make it interesting enough that I'll play it for a week every 6 months maybe. No matter how many mods or creations i add, it's just boring, bland, and an obvious example of what bethesda gives us now that todd howard runs things. You have a studio known for interesting locations, creatures, factions, and races, and you get none of that here. They said ""skyrim in space"" like we'd have multiple alien races to choose from, or at least interact with like in fallout, but no. All the aliens are alright animals at best, which are rarely even especially interesting designs, all the planets in the ""massive exspansive universe"" they promised are just boring procedurally generated garbage that you have to add mods to actually make interesting. The leveling system sucks, and again, you have to add mods to make it work, all the weapons are forgettable and all the space suits are lack luster unless, you guessed it, you add new ones with mods. Basically every system of this game is a massive let down, made all the more shitty, by the fact that todd howard pushed this at as as hard as he could like it would be the next great game of our age, when in reality, it's just another example of why in the next 10 years bethesda is going to go bankrupt and dissolve, because they keep giving us garbage because todd is their god, even though he has no idea what makes a game good, and hasn't since fallout 3. I have not met a single irl person that enjoys this game beyond something to do to kill time sometimes, unless space is their autistic special interest/Big hobby, and even then, it was only 1 person that actually seemed to like it, and even they had complaints.

Starfield,1716740,209567041,"Starfield was a major disappointment. I love space themed media and love Bethesda games despite their flaws. Unfortunately, Starfield takes the worst elements of Bethesda games and a lousy excuse for a space-themed story and combines them in this awful excuse for a game.

The positives:
Visually, the game looks good. That is the one plus I found playing this game.

The negatives:
- Crashes frequently on multiple machines (tried on a 4080 super and a 3060, both crashed at multiple points in a single hour of gameplay)
- Bugs (sound cutting out, skipping dialogue, characters getting stuck in geometry, etc.) Seriously, I thought the game didn't have gun sfx for the first 40 minutes because my sound glitched out from the very beginning. I had to reload a save to get it back.
- Corny, lame voice acting/ dialogue
- Bland combat
- Dog fighting/ ship combat is slow, unintuitive, and boring
- Story makes no sense (oh miner guy, because you saw a mystic vision from a piece of rock I will now give you my ship and send you to meet my space cult brothers. No there was no build up to this. No you can't refuse. Yes all of your dialogue options make you way too enthusiastic for this.

I can't recommend this to anyone. I was bored to tears after the first ten minutes, and after watching someone else play past where I was to see if it got any better... it got worse. If you REALLY like bethesda and anything space-related, you may be able to find something you like from this. However, I doubt most will. My recommendation is give this one a pass (or if you're really into modding you could try it with that but I couldn't be bothered.)

Starfield,1716740,209517296,"This game was the death knell for any hype I would carry into a game that had yet to be released.

This game fell into the same pit that doomed Cyberpunk 2077 in that the developer promised a genre-defying look on RPGs. An open-world game located in space with a ship-building system, base building, procedurally-generated worlds offering endless exploration, and a newly created universe for you to explore.

Overall, it didn't land most of what it was promised but I did enjoy the ship building system even though it was limited (and still is) in what it can do. The overall story is rather unremarkable and the best compliment I can give is to call this game Skyrim in space. There are a handful of major cities but not much to do within them and a lot of quests take you on a tour of the universe that offer a one-stop-shop of what the game has to offer. Never did I once feel as if I was in a lived-in world comparable to what Skyrim made me feel, but it is still go in its own merit.

Starfield,1716740,209398555,"Starfield – A Massive Space Sandbox, But Not Every Toy Shines the Same

I went into Starfield with a big mix of excitement and caution. After spending years in Elder Scrolls and Fallout worlds, the idea of Bethesda finally creating a brand new universe felt huge. But a part of me kept wondering if a game this enormous could really live up to its own ambition.

After many long hours, here is the truth. Starfield is huge, packed, beautiful and sometimes genuinely magical. But it is also uneven. Some moments feel like you are exploring the endless frontier of space. Other moments feel like you are staring at menus in a sci fi simulator.

The World and Atmosphere: A NASA Punk Dream, But a Safe One

The Settled Systems look amazing. The space suits, the ships, the cities, the planets and all the handcrafted zones show just how much effort the art team put in.

New Atlantis is clean and futuristic.
Neon is a neon soaked cyber city full of corruption.
Akila City feels like a frontier settlement pulled straight out of a space western.

Everything has personality.

The problem is that the universe is not always surprising. For a sci fi game with billions of possibilities, Starfield rarely feels truly strange or mysterious. It looks great, but it plays safe.

Story and Quests: Big Ideas, Good Execution

The main story about Constellation chasing mysterious artifacts has strong themes. Multiverse concepts, cosmic mystery and philosophical questions are all here.

But the actual storytelling is solid rather than unforgettable. It works, but it does not always hit with the emotional power it could have had.

The faction quests are much better.
The United Colonies feel militaristic and righteous.
Freestar Rangers give you a space western sheriff fantasy.
Crimson Fleet lets you live a full pirate life.
Ryujin Industries is all about corporate espionage.

These questlines consistently deliver better drama and more memorable moments than the main plot.

Exploration: Thousands of Planets, But Same Feeling

This is where Starfield stumbles.

On paper you can land anywhere. In practice most planets feel similar. The same structures, the same enemies, the same loop of scanning and looting. It starts exciting but settles into routine quicker than expected.

The handcrafted locations are the real stars. Whenever the game takes you somewhere designed with intention, everything improves instantly.

Space Travel: More Menu Than Adventure

Flying your ship sounds amazing in theory, but most of the time you are jumping through menus and fast travel screens. The game looks like a space exploration RPG, but the spaceship gameplay rarely reaches its full potential.

Walking inside your ship is great. Building it is even better. Actually traveling in it is limited.

Combat, Weapons and Skills: Solid but Not Revolutionary

Combat in Starfield feels good. Weapons have impact, zero gravity firefights are fun and enemy reactions are decent.

The skill system is fine but not extremely deep. Some skills feel essential, some feel pointless, and build diversity is limited compared to other RPGs.

It gets the job done but does not redefine anything.

Ship Building and Systems: The Brightest Part of the Game

This is where Starfield shines brightest.

Building ships is addictive.
Adding new modules.
Tweaking engines.
Rearranging the interior.
Creating something ridiculous but beautiful.

It is easily one of the best ship creation systems in any game.

Outposts are more divisive. If you enjoyed base building in Fallout, you will find something fun here. If not, you can ignore them completely and miss nothing important.

Technical Presentation: Beautiful but Interrupted

Starfield is visually impressive. Lighting, interiors, cities and planetary landscapes all look fantastic. Character models are much better than previous Bethesda games.

But the loading screens break immersion. There are many. Enter a ship, enter a room, land on a planet, leave a planet. These small interruptions add up over time.

Verdict: A Huge Universe, But Still a Foundation for Something Greater

Starfield feels like the first chapter of a much bigger vision. The framework is huge, detailed and full of potential, but not all systems shine equally.

It is a game you can lose yourself in.
It is a universe worth exploring.
But it is not the perfect space RPG people dreamed of.

Even with all its flaws, Starfield delivers a memorable journey. It is good, sometimes great, but not legendary. At least not yet.

Starfield,1716740,209255206,"i don't think this is a bad game, but it's definitely disappointing.

i should preface this with the fact that i do have some bias, as i find sci-fi to be a much more boring setting than their other series in a fantasy or post-apocalyptic world. that said, i still have lots of issues with this game which go far beyond my lack of interest in the setting.

the gunplay in this game is a major improvement over any previous bethesda games. it still doesn't feel as good as other modern first-person-shooters, but i don't think it needs to. i really feel like it's gotten to a point where the gunplay is as good as it needs to be for what is really an open-world-rpg first, first-person-shooter second. a small gripe i have however, is that the gun designs themselves are a bit uninteresting. in their pursuit of a nasa-punk visual theme, a lot of the guns don't actually make sense in how they would function. which i think is fine! however while the fallout series has plenty of guns which wouldn't make functional sense in the real world, their designs can be really unique and interesting. i found the guns in starfield to be unfortunately really forgettable - i think the corporate dystopia theme of the game played into this in a negative way, i would have liked to have more weapons i could get attached to. there wasn't any ""starting 10mm pistol"" to get fond of, nor was there much in the way of single-appearance unique weapons like the junk jet or deliverer from fo4. all uniques were just name and stat changes (sometimes with a paintjob swap) of an existing, normal weapon type. actually unique uniques do take more work but i feel like they're really important in giving the player something to get attached to over the course of gameplay. also, the really fun weapon (and armour) upgrade system from fallout 4 is back, but i feel like it's implemented far worse in this game. there is not nearly as much visual change with the upgrades in starfield, and overall it just feels like a much more shallow, uninteresting system which is easy to ignore for your entire playthrough. considering the potential shown by the already good system in fo4, i'm really disappointed that the modularity of weapons and armour took a major backstep rather than introducing further depth. 

a quick touch on character progression perks is that the system feels a little more rpg-ish and encourages specialisation at the start which is nice, but i really feel like far too many perks are simple number boosts, there is not nearly enough unique abilities in the perk trees to feel gratifying enough to specialise into. number-based stat improvements are boring and don't feel rewarding. specialisation as a whole also falls of a cliff, as this game strongly urges the player to spend lots of time on one single character, which means you'll become a jack of all trades at some point anyway. it makes the upgrade system feel rather meaningless.

touching on clothes and armour, the modular multi-part armour system from previous games is gone, but i feel like it hasn't sufficiently been compensated for. the armour system in this game is so disappointingly inexpressive. you always have to be wearing a spacesuit in this game (unless you're in oxygenated settlements) which is fine, that makes sense. my problem is that the spacesuits are so incredibly samey and boring. they all take up one single equipment slot for the body, along with a helmet for the single head slot, and that's it. what's worse is that the spacesuit upgrades (using the fo4 upgrade system) don't make any visual change to your suit whatsoever, meaning that the only way to get a new look is to find a different type of spacesuit alltogether - of which there are only a limited number of types. the limited amount of equipment slots, and further limited alterations to that equipment means the total number of combinations for your look is really small, and that's just really disappointing as someone who values customising their character a lot. it's a shame when they introduced a genuinely really impressive new character creator.

one major gripe i have there however is the small number of hairstyles, with no long-hair options. this feels like more of a cop-out to fit in spacesuit helmets than anything actually reasonable, more hairstyles are needed not just to make your character feel unique, but for npc variation too. the character creator in every other way is a major upgrade though, and the reintroduction of traits and the background system is super cool, i only wish it affected your playthrough more strongly to encourage specialising and trying multiple different characters out. 

the most important parts of these games for me are the quest design, characters, and open world though, and unfortunately, these three aspects are where the game flounders the most. i'll try keep it brief to not hit the character limit, but essentially: 

i found the quest design to be an improvement in some ways (the basis of most quests was really interesting), and the game makes an effort to have the player express themselves conversationally in the quests. however these points of expression feel shallow, as one recurrant theme in the quests of this game is the lack of outcome diversity. you constantly feel railroaded into one or at most two outcomes, which cheapens the effect of you expressing anything different in conversation. the most divergent outcomes come from the ending of faction questlines - however even these divergences lack npc responsiveness and integration into the world, which makes it feel like your choice didn't really matter.

characters have improved in some ways and fallen flat in others. the follower system in starfield is fantastic, the followers each feel far more fleshed out and grounded in the world, their reactivity is really important, and i think this is one of the best thing starfield does, and needs to carry into future bethesda games. the problems here are that there are only 4 unique followers in this game which have this fantastic depth, and they're all rather samey since they're from the same main story faction. i feel no reason to use the more generic followers when they don't feel like real characters who react to what i do the same way the main four followers do. i just want more of this good system, that's all. 

outside of the four major followers, i did unfortunately find a vast majority of characters in this game to be bland and forgettable, even compared to other bethesda games. the innoffensiveness of the four main followers can even include them in this conversation, despite them having the most depth in the game. i unfortunately just did not find there to be any jarl balgruufs or ulfric stormcloaks or nick valentines or mr houses in this game. i wasn't particularly excited to see anyone or learn more about anyone, it's a major point of disconnect between me and this game's setting, there aren't many people in the game's world that i actually care about. 

finally, the open world. or worlds. this is the worst part, unfortunately. bethesda's strengths are in their interconnected open world design. and this game just doesn't have that interconnectedness. they still kill it at the atmosphere and visual design of the environments, but the world (or galaxy in this case) struggles to find meaning when everything you do, and everywhere you go, is so separated from everything else. the world is cohesive and makes sense, i just struggle to find meaning or enjoyment when it doesn't feel like there's anywhere to call home - not even my ship. having a thousand different worlds doesn't make the game feel bigger, it just makes every world feel smaller, and that lack of the human touch in an interconnected world design squanders bethesda's biggest strength. 

i do think this game gets far too much undeserved hate, i think it's a good game, but not a great one. 6.9/10.

Exploring planets has it charm for a good while, then you start to see the exact same locations you saw an hour ago. And that's basically going to be the exploration experience for the rest of the playthrough.

Starfield proves that you can improve everything except the things you refuse to rethink, and they brought their best effort and their worst instincts. The result is a game that stands as a monument to effort and a memorial to imagination, where every improvement only sharpens the contrast with the ideas that should have been left behind.

I mostly liked the main plot, but it lacked that feeling of urgency that previous Bethesda games had. I felt no real need to finish the main quest line, and instead felt more engrossed in other quest lines, some of which felt more urgent.

The weapons are also a big issue in this game. Some of the weapons look good or okay for the most part. Others... no. Just no. The Freestar Collective weapons look like steampunk and sci-fi had a horribly disfigured baby. What I'm saying is, their design doesn't look practical enough to actually be semi-believable.

The combat gameplay is fun, though I did find it necessary to tweak it with mods. I didn't like that one part of the galaxy was full of high level enemies, while another would have low level enemies. Space combat is amazing. I love the different ship weapons available, and I love customizing my ships.

I don't care for the crafting, so I've downloaded a mod that makes modifying weapons no longer require crafting components. Gathering resources and putting points into perks I really didn't care about was a bit of a buzzkill. Busywork, I guess you could say.

I found some of the characters likable and interesting, others not so much. I really don't have any glaring complaints in this regard.

Are you still considering this title? I'll share my point of view.

I'm great TES fan, lost ton of hours in Skyrim some time ago. This is important, because I have soft spot and Starfield has many similarities - it's the same engine!
I'm also casual gamer, 30+y/o with family. That's also important.

I'm 30h in, did fights, exploration, storyline, upgrades. I think I touched most of aspects of the game. It feels fine, but not for everyone.
Game gives me option - I can set up my own pace of action, change the diffuculty and choose more immersion / more comfort. Are you in the mood to jump straight into shooting again and again? You can do it. Fast quest progression? Sure think! Manage inventory and ships upgrades? Let's go. Slow sightseeing and photo-mode? You're welcome.

It's not only that you will choose how to deal with adventures, how to approach another ""bandit camp"", but gameplay gives you more option, like more survival if you are into this. It's not only ""difficulty level"", there are more in-depth variables.

Emptiness.
Yes, that's a thing. So think about it - are you ready to deal with it? Space is empty and that's a fact. This is ""NASA Punk"", not StarWars.

Slow-paced.
More often, than not. I'm not bothered by loading screens, but they are here. And yes, 20% of the time you will spend in some menu, doing researches, upgrades etc.

Estethics.
You like it or not. It's a bit cluncky, not so far away into the future. You've seen the videos.

Further customisation.
There is a lot to do around the game. Not only gameplay option, but creations from other players as well.

Any and all interest you MIGHT have in sci fi or sci fantasy, will not be quenched with Starfield.
The most interesting part of the game is the ship builder and it's not even that good because it's intertwined with one of the most horrible and barbaric "" rpg "" systems I've ever seen. You complete essentially "" achievements "" to increase your perk levels in Starfield and that restricts genuinely everything your character is capable of. Want to use jetpacks? Perk with achievements for upgrades to use the better jetpacks. Want to fly a faster ship? Perk with achievements for upgrades to buy better ship parts. Want to be able to mod your weapons to not be literal dogshit? Perk with achievements for upgrades to make better parts. The entire game is like this, and it's genuinely the least statistic based RPG I've ever seen and it's all the worse for it.

Enemies aren't just sponge-y. Anything over level 30 or so that's not a common rabble is toting enough HP bars ( yes enemies have MULTIPLE HP bars for you to chew through in this trainwreck of a game ) to bore you to death before they actually drop. 

The questlines are a joke, the writing is dreadful and feels like something made up by a 10 year old who just kept doing that thing ( if you're a parent you know ) where they go "" And then a dude in dark armor shows up and attacks the town, and then a portal shows up and a bunch start pouring out, and then you have to run away from it, and then... "" ad infinitum. It's BAD.

Performance is the worst in any bethesda title so far and the loading screens. The LOADING screens.

Starfield,1716740,208980828,"I really wanted to enjoy this game... I love the art direction, the ships, the outfits, even the stupid gun styles, but in 2025, the Creation Kit is just too limited for type of game. The story and gameplay is mostly ""meh"" and I think even the Modding community agrees.

I'm getting really tired of Bethesda outsourcing their games to be fixed by their own player-modder base. It's rude and it's lazy of them to charge $70 for a game that needs to be fixed by their own customers... It was really charming and exciting at first back in 2011 when there was only 100 people working for Bethesda at the time, but they still made games that millions of people were really passionate, and people's expectations were naturally lower. This game just doesn't have the same vibe. It's dull, it's slow, it's under-cooked, and it's heart-breakingly shallow. You are going to spend half of this game in the Fast-Travel UI because of the way the Creation Kit handles loading and unloading scenes and tilesets. 

The excuse / mantra I keep hearing from fans: ""Well, it's a Bethesda game, so what do you expect?"" That nonsense isn't going to fly for much longer. Especially if this studio is still planning to make Elder Scrolls 6. The writing is on the wall. Bethesda Game Studios now employs over 5 times that amount of people (maybe more). and currently has 4 different office locations. They are not a scrappy, underdog, Indie studio anymore... The fact that they've embraced that mantra as part of their brand identity as a AAA game studio is just terrible. and in my opinion they should feel ashamed.

Hot take, I'm just gonna say it, because it's true...
Star Citizen is a more complete Space Exploration game than Starfield. It has actual ships that you can fly, with proper physics simulation, It even has a handful of planets that you can land on and explore that don't all feel like empty deserts. So is No Man's Sky. which also now has ships that you can build like Legos- just like Starfield. So this game ultimately has very little to offer in terms of originality, exploration, crafting, story, or fun. 

Maybe one day, if this game cost $30 on sale, I'd say go ahead and give it a shot. But I can't in good faith recommend this game to anyone- unless some crazy mad-lad made a mod in this game, to make a better game than Starfield.",False,1,1123

I don’t need those anymore—because no game I’ve ever played is as boring and empty as Starfield. I can’t even explore a second planet for more than ten minutes before my eyelids start to droop and I feel like I’m about to fall asleep on the spot.

I really tried to play and enjoy it for what it is, but I can’t shake the feeling that the game was scientifically designed to be as unengaging as possible.

When I was a kid and adults said video games were a mindless waste of time, I never understood their perspective. With today’s AAA releases like Starfield, I absolutely get it now.",False,4,363

I like the combat gameplay, I think building modular spaceships is cool, and it was really interesting learning about the universe the game is set in while visiting Earth or exploring those ruins found on some planets. None of that is enough to save this game from how utterly empty it is. It feels like they had tons of great ideas, but then they didn't create a world where players could interact with any of it. 

I also expected more from outpost building. Fallout 4 handled it great with their settlement system, but it was a buggy mess which ruined the game after about 60 to 100 hours of playtime. I figured they could fix those bugs and let you build colonies on habitable planets, but instead you just gather resources and setup machines to auto-craft items. I guess I was hoping for something like in Mass Effect: Andromeda, but with a more hands-on approach instead of just completing some quests to have colonists move in on their own. You can decorate your house if you get one, but there's no point in ever getting a house because you have no reason to ever go home. The most I ever used my house for was storage. It was a glorified warehouse with a bed and my plushie collection. I stored most of my items in the cargo holds on my spaceship, so building up storage at home was mostly just a never-ending cycle of trying to build more storage to store more resources in hopes that eventually I could actually get enough space to store enough resources to craft stuff I would actually want to make. Progressing your character also requires you to wipe out all the progress you make on this front, so it really doesn't feel worth it. You're better off grinding credits to buy whatever it is that you want.

The exploration is also just awful. Big empty worlds with nothing of interest. You just go around scanning stuff. Sometimes you find abandoned buildings which can be fun to explore for the first time, but then you go to another planet and find the same building there, story elements and all. I wouldn't mind exploring the same places if I reset the world, but the fact that I can find the same point of interest on four different planets in a single playthrough really makes those rare finds in the vast nothingness Bethesda has provided us with completely meaningless. 

If the game wasn't so empty and boring for the vast majority of playtime then I would keep playing it, but I can't be bothered. I'm also not going to hope the DLC fixes all these problems. I really can't express enough how much I don't want to play this game again despite how much I enjoy the good parts. I bought the game on launch and I put a lot of time into it hoping that I could figure out what makes the game good, but I never found it. I was weary after seeing how Fallout 76 looked on launch, but I was willing to give it a try. After playing this game I started to worry that even Elder Scrolls 6 won't be any good.

As a decades-long Bethesda Game Studios fan, this is one of the most boring, uncompelling games I have ever played. I didn't even know it was possible to make a game this boring, but I guess when you base a game's design around PlayStation 1 loading screens and literal emptiness you get this. I can't rationalize why there are so many loading screens when there is seemingly no content to load. This was the first BGS game I could not finish because it felt like an obligation rather than a game. I stopped at the ""big reveal"" because if that was the best the game could offer then it wasn't worth finishing. Sure enough, I looked up the ""ending"" of the game and it ended exactly how I expected, glad I didn't stick around and waste another 10+ hours. That's not even the worst part, they genuinely thought it was a great idea to [spoiler]erase pretty much all of your progress just for some ""haha isn't that crazy?"" kind of BS[/spoiler] at the end of the game. PlayStation fans shouldn't even be upset that they didn't get this game because they missed nothing of value. I can think of probably a dozen other games that do exactly what this game tries to do and more. If there is one nice thing I can say about this game, it's probably the new lock-picking mini-game is kinda fun, but that's the only thing that comes to mind.

A lot of the game design is outdated, clunky, not interconnected, and it all just falls apart in an incredibly unfun way.

Which is a shame! I had followed news for this game for years, and was INCREDIBLY excited for it! i watched all the pre release shows and dev interviews and stuff, followed online discussion, and i really genuinely truly thought Starfield would be something special. Something like Skyrim and Fallout 4, while being incredibly flawed games through and through, still had that special something, that Bethesda magic. That feeling of exporation, of having a huge fun sandbox to fuck around in, interesting lore, and rpg mechanics engaging enough to have a good time and become ridiculously powerful after coming from nothing. I have thousands of hours in other bethesda games, yet despite giving Starfield a *genuine* go, disconnected from all the online criticism, and genuinely wanting, craving to love it....

I walk away after only 30 so hours, not really wanting to play anymore. and its a shame! Its so obvious that a lot of very passionate and talented people worked on it! I see the vision, the old timey sci fi conventions and stuff, the whole nasa ""punk"" aesthetic thing, ooooh mystery and ADVENTURE and being campy and a good time, i was all for that! and the game looks beautiful! the music is pretty damn good too! ship combat is pretty fun! and a lot of the questlines are middling to pretty good!
But its just loading screen after loading screen after loading screen, meaningless fetchquest that couldve been an e-mail one after the other, and where that sort of thing was fine in skyrim, it just falls apart here. The Starfield doesnt feel like a living, breathing world, due to the way you actually interface with it, mostly consisting of fast traveling and constant loading screens. Sure, in skyrim, you could play like that if you liked to, or you could walk, and find something interesting along the way, a billion new quests, random encounters, whatever. here, its the only way to play the game.

After investing over 11 hours into Starfield — just to complete the first mission — I’ve hit a wall. Not because I ran out of content, but because the immersion collapsed under its own weight. I wanted to believe in this universe, but here’s where it broke down for me:

Companion AI is broken: Sarah repeats herself constantly, fails to keep up during missions, and teleports into the ship mid-combat with no continuity or reaction. It’s immersion-breaking and emotionally flat.

Planetary exploration is hollow: I landed near the Chlorine Ocean on Earth hoping to see a beach — but no matter where I clicked, I got the same prefab zone. Earth has no ruins, no landmarks, not even a single dilapidated building. It’s a texture map, not a memory.

Modding is still locked: Without full plugin support (.esp/.esm), we can’t get dynamic animation mods, companion overhauls, or meaningful adult-themed content. Collections exist, but they’re scaffolds — not systems.

I skipped the DLC: I didn’t buy Shattered Space because recent reviews were overwhelmingly negative. As of now, only 48% of recent Steam reviews are positive — meaning more than half of players are dissatisfied. That told me everything I needed to know.

Nobody is saying people don’t want to like this game — or that the development effort isn’t impressive. I’m just disappointed in the end result, and I don’t want Bethesda to give up. They’re off to a great start, but we need community involvement like with ESO and Zenimax, and regular 3-month updates with actual improvements.

We don’t need more paid mods that muck up our ability to install mods from Nexus. I’m really sad this is happening. I expected more from Bethesda — and the fact that Microsoft bought them should have improved things, not made them worse.

I’m not here to troll or flame. I just want to see this game become what it was meant to be. Right now, it feels like a myth half-told — beautiful in concept, but unfinished in execution.

I’m so disappointed. I really want this game to succeed, but I feel like the company has already given up on it. I’m unhappy with it in its current state. It needs a lot of work — but it is off to a great start.

I’m being open and honest about my feelings. The concept is solid. The end result isn’t finished and needs development — not more DLCs or paid mods.

Space is empty, not every planet is going to be a booming metropolis! Some barren or hostile to life. But as a whole in a Bethesda game, starfield has more locations and more quests than any other previous title. The sheer freedom in this game is awesome. Ships are each unique inside and out. Heck you can disable engines and pirate ships. There are thousands of space stations, planets, civilizations, etc to explore. The world feels alive. I truly can't understand what the complaints are about. This game is the biggest world with ultimate freedom. Plus there are tons of mods and add ons including a Star Wars themed game. I just finished a doom inspired mission which was short but cool trip to hell with a reward being the doom armor and weapon. I think this game is amazing. The graphics the freedom, the gameplay, the infinite variety of weapons, suits, ships and mods. I highly reccomend if you like fallout or elder scrolls games. You can even build bases on planets, not my thing but you can.

Many compare this to No man's sky, while no man's sky is more about exploration and building, starfield actually has a story, factions, and 1000's of quests. NMS got old quick, way too much of the same and those infinitely spawning sentenels being the only real threat gets old quick. It's aggravating dealing with the same enemy. Anyway I liked this way better than NMS, but that's me, games that focus on crafting lose their luster real quick and require too much time investment.",True,4,1545

--------------------------

Pros:

Gunplay is satisfying for a Bethesda game, almost feeling like a dedicated shooter in how entertaining blasting opponents can be.

Zero-G movement is incredibly fun and implemented really well. By far the best new feature this game adds.

Cons:

Despite the focus on the spacecraft, they are largely an afterthought - space combat is far too simple, ship components are horrifically unbalanced, and there is no actual flying to be done. Jumping systems, travel to planets, landing, and takeoff are all merely loading screens. Rather than feeling like an open galaxy, the world of Starfield feels more like a series of rooms with a starry backdrop.

Similarly, outpost building is an utter waste of time. There is no need to ever build an outpost - no colonies to build up and populate with settlers, no resource incentive (since you would have to build a dozen outposts to get the right combination of useful resources), and the story never touches on the feature even a little.

Apart from the problems with the space content, the actual RPG elements are all over the place. There are far too many features locked behind perks, far too many levels for each perk, and the loot system took all the worst parts of Fallout 4's insistence on being able to pick up everything while simultaneously removing any utility in doing so.

The companions in this game are mostly dreadfully dull people. I liked Sam well enough, but they are all still just a single personality trait personified. They have no nuance in thought, no real differences of opinion, barely any backstory of note. They exist merely to fill crew positions and repeat the same 3 lines of dialogue whenever you switch loading screens. You would think a guild of explorers would be full of bright-eyed, scientific, and curious minds - but you quickly realize that these people will offer nothing of value in the actual act of exploration.

Speaking of exploration... There is almost none to be had. You can land on planets, scan minerals, flora, and fauna; yes. However, there is nothing else to it other than the same randomly-generated pirate outposts, abandoned labs, military facilities, or mining outfits. There are no hand-placed nooks with secrets to find, no environmental storytelling, no surprises. It's all just an algorithm spitting out random junk and passed off as ""exploration"". The only incentive to even explore at all is selling the survey data - you don't get anything other than money for having done so. Of all my issues, this is the most egregious and the one that really spits in the face of any fan that was once excited for this game.

I've tried Morrorwind, Oblivion, and Skyrim and found them boring. The hours I have in Skyrim are only because I kept starting and quitting.

Sure it's still buggy. The main quest is kinda boring and jarringly shoved in an otherwise decent sci-fi world. But I'd rather play this than any of their other games or even Baldur's Gate 3. I hope they don't give up the IP and ditch the weird magical multiverse crap in the next one.",True,0,13188
Starfield,1716740,208285456,"I can't recommend this game to everyone, as it is not for everyone, sadly. The reviews are mixed because some like it, and others don't. I happen to be one of those that do like it. Story's good, relatively riveting in parts; plot twists abound. Gun-play could use some work to be honest, but it isn't the only part of the game that matters to me, so it's easily overlooked. 

Difficulty can now be adjusted in the game play section of the settings menu. You can make enemies deal less damage and yourself deal more, and that is welcome because as someone who doesn't spend that much time in first person shooters, I don't have years of experience with those--I'm much more of an RPG guy that uses melee weapons such as swords, bows and arrows, magic, etc etc.

Now the bad: Without spoiling too much...if you don't do something a certain way at the end of the game, you can and will be stuck with the same outcome over and over. I did not know this going in, and every new game+ felt like a bad episode of The Twilight Zone, lol. Way too much deja vu every time I began again, in other words. That is pretty much the only thing I hate. Had my real life friend who enjoyed this game as well told me this without spoiling too much, I might've been spared repeating scenarios. 

There are mods to fix this for that reason I'd guess, but if you want achievements I'd focus on the above relatively vague advice. Also I believe every new game+ means you deal less and less damage to enemies...something you'd have to look up because Bethesda does not tell you this...

The price point for the game plus the DLC is rather disturbing too. But...all in all...if you love a solid story, don't mind halfway-decent gun-play, and can afford to shell out a little over $100 for the game and the DLC, then go for it! Otherwise, wait until it goes on sale (if ever) and get it then. I am not writing a glowing review...I'd give this a 3.5 out of 5 stars for not explaining in-game how to avoid the twilight zone (and the price point). Not everyone makes enough money to afford a nearly $100 game with the DLC included...jeez. Plus I hear Shattered Space isn't even that good. Having not gotten there yet as I took a gaming hiatus...I cannot say for certain.

Sub-par story (at best), POIs repeat too often/less explorability for a space exploration RPG game, genuinely terrible exploration in space as well, lackluster combat mechanics and weapons (guns, I need more guns instead of different variants of the same damn few guns), paid mods (I support mod developers but damn, they just push this on you more and more). For how big the game is, there is so little to do at most times.

The game calls itself an RPG, yet the game constantly railroads you during quest lines. Almost all choices result in the same outcome, making multiple playthroughs almost pointless.

Aside from what I personally call the ""Emil Pagliarulo Problem""(the poor writing problem), the other glaring issue is the insane number of loading screens. If I got a dollar for every loading screen I had in a three hour play session, I'd probably have $100. That doesn't sound like much but that would be roughly $33 an hour. Obviously I was being over-dramatic, but let me just lay out how frequently loading screens are. You enter a ship? Loading screen. Travel to a different solar system? Loading screen. Travel to a specific lunar or planetary surface in the system? Loading screen. Want to land on the planet? Loading screen! Want to exit your ship? Loading Screen!!

Exploring space, upgrading ships, and finding weird little side quests kept me hooked way longer than I expected. The gunplay’s actually solid, the music’s great, and when the game hits those big cinematic moments, it really feels epic.

The first time you walk into somewhere you think 'This is brilliant!', but after you walk through the same building on a dozen different planets, it isn't just tedious... its disappointing. Its not even like there's a huge amount of different enemies to spice them up either.

You could make the argument that space travel and settlement on the edges of known space would be tedious and repetitive. That there'd be a lot of emptiness, that the cold clinical HUDs are functional as you'd expect to see, that all the colours are drab, everything seems clinical, and that Bethesda may be onto a nice arcade-like space sim here. But this isn't being marketed as a sim, its being marketed as an adventure; exploration, combat, space flight, new places, new challenges etc. and it only JUST scrapes in to meet that definition.

The ship builder is pretty good though. Adding weapons and modules to create something that looks like no other is damn fun but the grind to get there isn't really worth it.

Bethesda has some wonderful hits, so naturally, they're bound to have misses.
Next time, shrink the universe and diversify it. 

Honestly, go buy No Mans Sky.
Its the culmination of 10 years of development, reward the devs for that alone. The game its beautiful and colourful, there is life, depth, and emotion to it. After the intro, it welcomes you in and you actively want to stay and see what it has to offer. There are repeated assets (of course) but there are a lot of different ones for the game to choose from.
While it doesn't have an in-depth shipbuilder, it does have a big settlement and structure element to it. Combat is minimal it must be said, but you can whittle away hours building a place of your own and look back at your results and feel like you've done something, unlike in Starfield.

W3 is an absolutely beautiful game. But, we're not reviewing this one. W3 beats out Fallout 4, but not because W3 had a better or more compelling story. W3 beat FO4 because in EVERY way, W3 was a better game, the story, the combat, the world building, the crowd functions, the DLCs, the beautiful replayability. Todd Howard thought for some stupid reason, this was a 1 off, and that his game should've won. The problem is, FO4 was a result of Todd, and by extension Bethesda thinking that because they had two flagship titles (Fallout and The Elder Scrolls) no matter what people would buy their games. So they make something average. The thing is, The Witcher 3 wasn't just GOTY in 2015, it set the GOLD STANDARD for RPG games afters that. Games should be at least what W3 is in order to be considered mediocre nowadays. So unfortunately, Todd spit this crap out for players thinking the same thing. ""I'm Todd Howard from Bethesda, people WILL buy my game."" Yeah, okay buddy. Barely 3,000 daily players. 

The game is less-than-average, no better than a 3.5-4.5/10. The main story is mid. The only storyline I enjoyed was the Crimson Fleet. Side quests are reused constantly, with very little breadth. I expected the classic fetch quests and ""go here, kill this enemy"" quest, but jeez, Bethesda really didn't write anything that well.

Characters are written really poorly, with your entire crew seemingly being okay with some big poly-orgy going on on the ship. On that note, the 4 options you have for romance is really, really disappointing. You cannot really fully get into the game and roleplay how you'd like. 

The ship building is the only saving grace this game has, coupled with the ship combat, it makes everything else sorta bearable. In addition, mods make this game playable. Star Wars: Genesis is the only reason I have put any reasonable time into the game. Which is a mod I HIGHLY recommend. The only downside is the fact that you have to give $90 to that burning husk of a company known as Bethesda Softworks in order to enjoy that gorgeous mod. 

Don't buy this game, don't buy it on sale, and don't play it. It's genuinely a bad game and it was VERY poorly executed. Before any idiots decide to say, ""if you didn't enjoy the game you wouldn't have put 500 hours into it"", no. Stop. $90 means I should be enjoying this game for years to come.

There are still thousands of us exploring the stars every day — building ships, tweaking mods, and losing track of time.

I’ve spent hundreds of hours in this universe, and honestly, you don’t do that with a game you don’t love.

Starfield,1716740,207484320,"This game doesn't know what it wants to be. Clearly, Bethesda was inspired by No Man's Sky but the open world nature of that game conflicts with Bethesda's strengths as a studio. The procedural generation of the planets results in content which commits the cardinal sin of gaming, which is that it is BORING. There are a few scattered points of interest, and some resources to gather and animals or plants to scan and that's basically it. NMS has all kinds of interesting things to find but not here. Plus the fact that you have to scan objects multiple times is just pointless busy work.

You do get the signature Bethesda RPG features like fully voice-acted dialog but, honestly, who cares? Who is actually listening to all of this? It worked in Skyrim because there are a lot more interesting characters and the world is more flavorful but here, IDK, I just did not really care about most of the characters I met and most of your companions are so goody two shoes and bland.

The combat is okay - it is serviceable at at least. Some of the extended quest lines are not bad. And the ship building is decent if kind of generic. My main issue with the gameplay is that Bethesda didn't commit to their own mechanics. You can mine and extract resources but they can all be bought so cheaply from basically anywhere that there is little point. You can build a base but your ship has all the features anyways so what is the point? And again, that's because the game doesn't know what it wants to be - it has some of the gathering-crafting mechanics of NMS but they feel relatively pointless. Some of the quest lines are pretty good but the core of the game is extremely generic and lazily implemented procedurally generated worlds which are boring and stale and just not fun to run around. In my opinion, it would have been better if they had concentrated on a more limited number of planets which were more densely populated with content and locations. This mish-mash of survival game, procedural generation, and hand-written quests just does not come together. It is like a bunch of disjointed parts that don't play well together.

And though I didn't ever get there, the NG+ mode is not a good fit for a game like this. You spend dozens of hours building bases and ships, finding the best gear, and doing all the quests and you want me to do it all over again, just with my better skills and abilities? Yeah, no thanks - I have no interest is resetting my progress. This is yet another feature that just seems tagged on which doesn't work well with the whole.

I will say that I did have some fun with this game and it has its merits. But for most of these boxes they were trying to check off here, you'd be better off playing No Man's Sky, which does ""endless"" space, procedural generation, and survival-crafting extremely well. There are also minimal loading screens - dear god, don't get me started with the ludicrous number of loading screens in Starfield. It's absurd.",False,4,10964

Hours Played: Too many for how little fun I had.

I want to love Starfield. I really do. Every year I reinstall it thinking, “Maybe this time the stars will finally align.” Then I make it about three hours in before realizing I’d rather be alphabetizing my ammo inventory in Fallout 4.

Don’t get me wrong — the gunplay is solid, the worlds look pretty, and there’s enough stuff to do to fill an interstellar Walmart. But the story? Man, it moves slower than a cargo ship with broken thrusters. Every quest feels like it’s daring me to care — and I’m losing that challenge hard.

If you like pure sandbox exploration, you’ll probably have a blast scanning rocks and stealing sandwiches from space pirates. But if you’re looking for that classic Bethesda storytelling magic — the “I accidentally became the leader of every faction” kind of fun — you might want to orbit elsewhere.

Starfield isn’t bad, it’s just... tedious. It’s like the game hands you the entire universe and says, “Do whatever you want!” but forgets to make any of it feel meaningful.

Maybe I’ll try again next year. Maybe by then, they’ll patch in fun.

Starfield,1716740,207426851,"I WANTED to like this game. There's so many good aspects of this game where you can see the potential. The New Creation Engine is amazing, the features for gravity, shipbuilding, and space combat feel really good.

People will shit on the engine or the loading screen frequency or any NPC animations, but these are all shallow things that don't affect the actual quality of the game. They're not the problem.

The problem is the questline design, and nothing makes it more clear than those few questlines that are designed well: The UC Vanguard Questline. It's makes such good use of the new engine and mechanics, it has good writing, you can explore a lot of what this game CAN offer.

Then you play anything else, like the main quest. Get thing from planet, go back to New Atlantis. Go to new planet, come back again. They have a huge playground in space that they just don't use. They have a few populated planets each with only one city - a little immersion breaking but I understand the limitations. The problem is they keep making you go between planets for the most inane things. If you're focusing on a questline you rarely stay in one place for long, and when you travel somewhere else there's no excitement or danger: you go through a loading screen to travel then go through another loading screen and another. If it was a loading screen to space and then there was something to do in space before getting to your destination, that would be SOMETHING. The reason everyone points to the loading screens as a flaw isn't because separate cells are unbearable, it's because Bethesda treated most of this game like all their others where everything is one single continuous map with some interiors. The separated maps aren't the fatal flaw, they're merely the lens that exposes the flaw.

This COULD be a good game - if it utilized its own systems and tech upgrades, but it doesn't. The engine feels modern, but the gameplay loop most questlines thrust the player into hasn't caught up. It's a disjointed, incongruous experience that occasionally shows you a 10/10 experience hidden beneath a pile of mediocrity.

One more message specifically for Todd Howard: We play your old games because they're fun to REPLAY and try different builds or factions. Cutting off certain parts of the game for one character based on the player's choices does not limit player freedom, but rather increases and rewards it. Removing consequences from player's choices does not increase player freedom, it renders it meaningless. Stop taking the wrong lessons from your older successes.

Starfield,1716740,207419557,"                I think its a good game. It has some good elements in it that I like. I like being able to steal enemy ships, I actually like the cut scene spaceship launches and landings. Nothing is over complicated. But it does feel just like skyrim in its gameplay. 
               While everything is new as far as characters, items, weapons and textures... the subconscious feeling is that I still feel like I'm playing Skyrim. It has the same FEEL and with that being the case, id vote that I would have rather seen a new Skyrim. I have over 2000 hours in Skyrim and that""s just on steam, not including all the time I played it on Xbox and I still play it from time to time. What made me so happy with Skyrim was the ability to look up anything in the console and manipulate the game with what I would say is 10000 cheats and I do appreciate that it was somewhat also available in this game. 
              I can see myself playing this game also for some time. But I would have much rather seen a brand new Skyrim. Wouldn""t even need to change much of the mechanics, just another continent to explore with a new beginning and background. Morrowind Remade or something. I played this for 37 hours and got bored, not because its a bad game, but just because it feels like I played a heavily modified Skyrim for 37 hours on top of the 2500 (give or take) hours I already played of Skyrim. 
              I do feel like the engine you are using in both this game and Skyrim works so much better for Skyrim than for a space game and can't really describe why. Every location in Skyrim was unique and was able to be so because most of the environments were somewhat expected to be the same but had different ""lore"" with each one. 
              Starfield feels more bland to me, there doesn't feel to be much lore between anything except the Sol system. Other than that, each location felt like it might as well be on any other planet. I felt it would have been interesting to have planets divided between factions instead of just player level. There is somewhat this division but you don't really feel or see it on the star map. 
              I found the whole main quest to be uninteresting, not because its bad, but more because a space game comes more in an interest in exploration and carving your own path than doing a job for someone else. I didn't like that lady telling me she had something to give me almost every time I got on the ship. ""Ok, its the fifth time you told me lady, I don't need reminded for the fifth time that you got me a piece of space cabbage."" like really... I think I shot her in the face a couple times over this and she still didn't shut up. I was trying to do the usual Skyrim stealth archer thing and she kept giving away our position and annoying me. I liked the idea of her coming along... at first.. until she proved to be incredibly annoying. Sorry, just a little bit about her, I usually tell her to stay in place as soon as we get off the ship. Then I got a new NPC lady later on, she was a little better because she would cloak with me when holding still, but then she started spouting off crap too. Now I had two people I just couldn't wait to drop off at home. 
              I didn't like quests that stuck me with people for a certain amount of time. I use the console to unlock the door at the trackers alliance so I can get to the console to do my own thing. I constantly start new games to try new builds and its a pain to go through the same quest over and over again. I like to freely do what I want in a space game. 
              Being able to buy new ships and upgrade them the way I want was fun, I didn't like how difficult it was to actually find the upgrades I wanted though. Level locking them didn't seem fun or realistic. Why cant I be some nobody with a lot of money and just start buy good ships and parts. Took away from being able to decide how I wanted to play.
               Ship registration prices were a bit of a boring way to balance the game in my opinion.
         No gambling in the red mile... that was a surprise... I was expecting a New Vegas experience but it was completely empty of that, I was a bit disappointed but at least there were a couple mods for it. I understand the ""illegal in other countries"" thing. So oh well, I guess they are to blame for ruining that one. I just don't quite understand that though because Star Wars Outlaws had gambling in it. 
             Anyways, I guess the biggest flaw with the game is that it already feels like the other 2500 hours I already invested in this engine. If we are going to stick with the same engine, then I would have liked an improvement to what was already great and still is... Skyrim. Skyrim 2 or Morrowind Remake, not a Morrowind retexture but a remake. I loved fighting Dagoth Ur at the end and loved the lore of his back story. Seeing that again with Skyrim graphics would be awesome. You really did have some great lore in Morrowind, loved going in and doing battle with Vivec to test my strength.
              Sorry Bethesda but you have Skyrim stamped on your forehead now, and you'll either have to do better and better versions of that or change your company name so you can side step expectations.

Starfield,1716740,207224363,"I don't usually write reviews for games, but I felt like writing one for this, which says something about it.

The game starts up very promising... The beautiful scenery and worlds, nice graphics, mysterious story about the artifacts that promises excitement and adventure, the vast universe with countless worlds and dynamic and exciting characters. On paper it sounds amazing, right? Well... on the surface. 

The main problem with the game is that the story is kind of boring. I wanted to get invested... but I often found myself not caring or skipping dialog just to move things along. Whenever that happens, you know you have lost your audience. There is just not enough soul in the story to make you care, to make you want to see things through to the end, as was the case with the Mass Effect games 1, 2 and 3. There is nothing like that here. And that is why ultimately this game has failed. 

Second, there is no space exploration as you would imagine it. Yes, you get to jump and land to many different world's VIA the loading screen, but you cannot explore space itself, for all you get is a sky box with a fairly low resolution planet in front of you. Even the jump sequence is not that exciting (as was the case in Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen). 

Now I know you can argue that Mass Effect games also did not allow you to fly around space yourself (you just got a loading screen video showing you jump between different Mass Relays), but Mass Effect was never promoted as an exploration game, Starfield was. 

The planet world's are beautiful in themselves, but a lot of times they lack those handmade cities or locations that make an open world game exciting to explore. Yes, there was plenty of beautiful flora and fauna to see and generic space structures scattered around the map, but after a while, it gets boring. And no, there are no massive planet-wide cities here, all you get are about four custom settlements that would fit into a neighborhood or two. 

Third, the game Engine is outdated and it shows. This is the first game that I absolutely had to install on an SSD for it is unplayable on a regular hard drive (I mean it plays, but with very frequent lags in audio and video). The interface is not very intuitive and at times frustrating, and too much emphasis was placed on collecting all sorts of useless objects on every turn, as this was meant to impress us with the variety of content. 

So this is what you have, and RPG without an exciting story, a confusing interface, and a space exploration game with no space exploration. Now, this game will probably be enjoyed by a niche audience, or someone who doesn't have a lot of expectations for this game, and buys this on sale or receives it as a gift. 

Now don't get me wrong, I had a lot of beautiful and exciting moments in Starfield, but they were kind of far in between. This is the type of game where you can put 40 hours into, and then watch the ending on YouTube because you get too tired of it. 

At the end of the day it seems like Bethesda needed a new ""bread and butter"" game to release, they smartly chose the space exploration genre, but were not willing to fully invest their time and energy for development to make an epic game, but still branded it as epic. I think if they give you an opportunity to fly around the space and add more depth to the story, they can salvage this game to make it truly epic.",True,13,1987

Typical Bethesda quirks are present but satisfying loot and an abundance of questing means there's pletny to do. Love the art, there's something really special about how this game looks. Is there room for improvement? Yes, there always will be in every video game. Would I still recommend it anyway? If you enjoyed Fallout and/or The Elder Scrolls, yes. It's kind of like Fallout in space.",True,0,10037
Starfield,1716740,207216842,"Summary: 
Starfield is definitely a good game. If you like the gameplay of Fallout or Elder Scrolls, this is basically the same in a sci-fi setting. There's exploration, looting, traditional combat, ship combat, resource gathering, equipment upgrading, settlement building/upgrading, ship upgrading, skill tree development, and factions to join or fight. And the game engine feels familiar. Despite what the social media and message board echo chambers say, the vanilla game was completely playable, just like every other Fallout and ES game I've played. I'd give it a biased 7/10. The gameplay appeals to me the way ES and Fallout do. The story is good. It definitely has some annoyances/flaws and took longer to get into than their other games, but there is much more to like than dislike. And they've continued to tweak it and make improvements. Plus, I have more hours in my 1st play-through of Starfield than any other game's 1st play-through - 425+ hours prior to the DLC and now over 525 hours with it. That surprised me.

Details: 
This took a little longer to get into than Fallout and ES games. I can see why some folks may have quit early. I arrived at New Atlantis 4-5 hours in. Immediately had side quest overload. About 15 hours in, I remembered there was a main story I was supposed to be doing. Somewhere between 20-30 hours, I was hooked. And aside from being forced to go undercover and join a side faction, I played the entire game joining only the main story faction. Despite the joke 'Most Innovative Gameplay' nomination, it did have a pretty cool game and story mechanic about half or two-thirds through the main story that should have been used more. Where I found No Man's Sky (about 120 hours played) *interesting*, I can't say that the game was always fun, especially being 3rd person. For me, Starfield was a lot more fun than NMS.

The main story is interesting, but didn't give me the sense of purpose their other games did. The more I played, the more depth it had, but the writing tends to keep it from ever being great. If Witcher 3 writing is S tier, Starfield is probably B tier or marginally A at best. The voice acting is the same - generally good, rarely great. The humor is similar to their other games, especially Fallout. There are editorial overtones about corporations and different societal values. Quips, comments, and responses by followers and NPCs can be interesting/entertaining the first time, but get repetitive and little annoying after that.

It's interesting to see the ship and hab design mostly influenced by the 60s and 70s space program and movies. Though tech for interstellar space travel is common, hand tools from the 20th century are all over the game because they are apparently still used - just not by players. I generally don't enjoy settlement building and upgrading, but have had fun upgrading my ships and tweaking the design as I gained access to better modules and weapons. The boost packs for the suits are fun, especially on low G planets or moons - it's like the marsupial mutation in Fallout 76 on steroids.

I played on Normal difficulty. I could take out multiple enemies 5-10 levels higher easily. However, I'm not too experienced with space combat (mostly avoided it in NMS) and found it frustrating early. I had to do other quests before I could upgrade my ship and skills to get past some quest-required space fights against 3 or 4 ships less than half my level. That's probably more of a 'me' issue, and the majority of fights are now much more manageable, but I do think the difficulty skews harder with ship combat resulting in an imbalance compared to regular combat. I saw they added options for raising/lowering regular or ship combat difficulty in May 2024, so thanks, Bethesda.

Surveying eventually got to my OCD and I 100% surveyed every place I visited. Surveying planets and moons is VERY chill for times when I want that. I ended the main story with over 500 planets and moons fully surveyed. It's a little disappointing that on nearly every planet and moon I visit, there is human development within view. Some folks have complained about how empty the game is, but on the scale of a galaxy (they say universe), it's incredibly highly populated. Bethesda is trying to balance scarcity of life and anything interesting that most planets would realistically have by adding human development to see or explore, some with a human presence to either help or fight. But, the variety of those random quests is lacking. They definitely reuse too many assets and situations too frequently. Certain random facilities on different planets and moons will not only be physically identical, but have the exact same situation (usually overrun by one of the pirate, cult, or mercenary groups) down to enemies doing the exact same scripted actions. Once you recognize these, it's easy to avoid if you don't want to bother. But, if there are enemies and you want to choose violence, it can be a fun way to try out new weapons and there is always loot. As I progress, I continue to find named stations or habs that are more unique and add more interest, depth, or back-story to the game. They usually have aspects I cannot access, so I assume are related to the faction quests I have almost completely ignored.

Some landscapes and skyscapes are very beautiful, even breathtaking. Despite a lot of diversity in planets and moons, a lot of icy moons are similar, if not identical. Many planets provide environmental variety with areas ranging from frozen plains, deserts, forests, savannas, hills, mountains, beaches, etc. Planetary traits get reused across many worlds, but based on the environment, may be snow and ice covered in one place, but in the middle of a rocky desert on another. I get it - they saved time and money on design and can drop an environmental layer on it to add variation. Although some weather can be annoying from a survival aspect, the weather changes add variety, which I like. IMO, the game is lacking in extreme weather. I would have preferred some planets/moons - Venus, for example - that require special gear, such as a mech suit or specialized vehicle. Speaking of which, since the buggy was added, I reloaded my last save before end-game and started exploring again. I enjoyed running around with the suit, but the buggy is a little faster. It's pretty basic, but a decent addition.

I've only encountered one quest breaking bug that others had, but it was a side quest and was fixed in one of the winter 2023 patches. Like most Bethesda games, the vast majority of bugs are on a spectrum from funny to annoying, but they rarely ruin the game. I haven't had many crashes (maybe 20 or so in the first 400 hours) and several early ones were driver crashes.

I have an AMD 5800X and had an OC'd PowerColor RX 5700 XT with 8GB that was showing its age. At 2560x1440 on mostly medium settings, I generally got 35 to 55 fps in outdoor areas. Planets with thick flora and higher human/alien populations dropped into the upper 20s. Lowering game resolution to 1920x1080 and using upscaling increased it by 5+ fps. Upgrading to a PowerColor RX 7900 GRE with most settings on high and using a tweaking guide has it running at 80-120 fps (my set cap) most of the time, only rarely dropping below 60 in highly populated areas with thick flora.",True,0,31526

Starfield,1716740,207176495,"I've read a lot of the reviews, and Reddit, etc. And I see the ratio of likes/dislikes on the store page. Honestly all that scared me away from this game until just a week or so ago, when I decided I just had to try it. I searched for some ""how to appreciate Starfield on its own merits"" discussions, and I really think that helped.

To truly enjoy Starfield, I had to unlearn my expectations from past Bethesda games. If you go in expecting ""Skyrim in Space,"" you'll miss the mark. But if you embrace it as a space RPG, with emphasis on Space that I'll get to in a second, you'll find a fun and rewarding adventure that captures its own kind of magic.

That classic Bethesda feeling of discovery is definitely here. I’d be randomly hopping from one star system to another and stumble upon a distress call that turned into a fantastic, multi-part quest like ""Mantis"" or ""Failure to Communicate."" That familiar, satisfying loop of exploring a hostile base, winning a firefight, and then methodically looting everything you can find is alive and well. The rewards for just getting lost and seeing what's out there are piles of clutter, a few credits, and loads of weapons and armor. Just like I'm used to.

This sense of adventure extends well to space itself. Hunting from horseback in Skyrim was fun, but hunting space pirates for bounties and loot in Starfield is a blast. The game truly shines when you're dogfighting between asteroids, boarding an enemy ship, and then making the choice to either sell it for scrap or take it back to your shipyard and rebuild it into your new flagship. The freedom to become a pirate, a bounty hunter, or just a humble trader is fantastic.

Finally, a note on the loading screens. In a medieval world like Skyrim, walking everywhere makes a certain kind of loreful sense. In a game spanning countless star systems, it was never going to be possible. I honestly think that Bethesda kept to their spirit here, and tried to make space exploration as practical, without being silly hand-wavey mechanics, as possible. For instance, if they were going to make it so that you could fly to orbit from the surface, it was always going to be a quasi-loading screen like No Man's Sky. Basically a short animation that plays, then boom, you're in space. Now you can do space stuff. That's basically what Starfield does, but you can't interact with the cutscene, just watch. And after you get used to it, it doesn't bother you any more.

Planets are vast and the distances between them are unimaginable. The loading screens are a necessary concession to that scale. For me, they function just like real interstellar travel would: you set your destination and wait a moment to arrive. The payoff is the wonder of stepping out onto a barren moon and just admiring the view from an alien world, which Starfield captures beautifully—often with a cave or an abandoned outpost nearby to sweeten the deal. If you enjoyed games like The Outer Worlds or even the quiet exploration of Kerbal Space Program, give this a try.

My only gripe is the limitation of the landing zones. It's true, that when you land on a surface you get boxed in and can't fly around and explore the surface. I wish they could do something about that, and maybe they will, but given the way they randomly drop points of interest in as you go, maybe not. Kerbal is remarkable in that all the worlds are pre-made and you can fly over them in real time, Starfield does lack that. But when you DO pick a spot, land, and start exploring, I find it to be just as magical.",True,0,22043

And even the populated areas of the world are dead: long gone are the old bethesda details of living cities with routines, schedules, and habits. Everyone just chills at their counters... all day. Every day.

The intro takes forever - you have 2 fights that take less than 30 minutes and fly a ship for 30 seconds in between and then it's like no joke 3 hours of just talking to people.

It is a good game, made way better with the introduction of cars. The combat is actually good if you crank up enemy difficulty (there's also very good difficulty settings). Flying and shipbuilding is fun, there are a lot of good side quests. They basically brought back the freedom of movement from Morrowind. But for all of those things they also seemingly made backsteps in a lot of areas (to fallout 4 levels). Plus they don't give you any information through the UI at all, weapon info, ship info, just missing QOL stuff which surely exists. It's as wide as an ocean and some parts of it are pretty deep and some are incredibly shallow but they all look shallow. Also they just didn't put enough assets in the game, Atlas shrugged and the cowboy factions and neon look like they have character but then you go into any other building and all the interiors are exactly the same.

I will say the writing of the main questline is probably the flimsiest of the major questlines in the game, but it isn't bad for Bethesda, frankly, and there is plenty of cool and memorable bits in it as well. 

On the other hand, the various faction questlines are nothing less than excellent. Best Bethesda faction questlines since the Oblivion Thieves Guild, but it's all of them in Starfield.

那么为什么在能像“纠缠不清”能时空错乱的“星空”世界中Bethesda不放个神器做出地球为何毁灭的内容让玩家游玩？采用的是跃迁回去直面废土地球，把作死的故事塞进文本语音记录然后让玩家看到废土中的NASA航天站感叹？我猜还是做不出来或者压根没想着做。虽然说“人类从历史中得到的唯一教训就是人类无法从历史中学到任何教训”，但宏观视角和作为玩家主角的个人的微观感受也互不影响，为什么不让玩家游玩这一过程。如果我们不知道从哪里来，又怎知道往哪里去？这，和我说的农业技术是相关联的。

其次我们来说一下多重宇宙和神器，用大家都在玩多重宇宙设定也行，但目的是有问题的，还是经典多重宇宙那一套即多个我多个重复却不同走向的人生。用“多重宇宙”这个东西，目的为何不能是突出宇宙“大”这一特点？我猜Bethesda是太想走“太空歌剧”的神秘和浪漫主义路线了，所以是经典的多重宇宙构架，但你那“归一”浪漫吗？我只在临门一脚时多个势力存活的队伍道别时看到了它，那“归一”它是什么属性？对此我研究了一下，显然不是用科学上的具体到微观粒子指它，创作团队应该也不会去研究我们道家思想，结合最后任务前见的老头子，还是西方哲学和宗教里的“归一”，但这在游玩时很难去理解到它，主要体现在哪里？你的多重宇宙构架已经完全覆盖了“归一”的表达，我还得选星狩或星使打对面呢！
再来说神器，提到神器我还是要说宗教元素的问题，在现今西方的文化作品中俩个特别重要的东西，即“宗教”和“家人/family侠”，数不胜数的内容都会往这方面引，家人侠我是接受的，游戏中陋室的伙伴就算家人，我能理解西方一些宗教国家下创作人的目的但我接受不了一点，这对本土人是好事但放眼全球可不是，你的故事到底还是科幻底色。对此所有往宗教这方面引导的作品我都不会满意甚至反胃，只有它来丰富故事可能会好一点，我不相信存下来的文明的未来是返回人类初始状态的各种崇拜。
主线上的一些任务触发很有问题，它会和阵容任务打架（如果你第一次玩没遇到我觉得很幸运），造成很糟糕的游玩体验且极其糟糕，而且联殖的指挥官有些任务触发和情节对话设计比较荒唐，会逼着玩家往深红走。
获得太空龙吼的互动过程还挺不错的，这值得夸，但龙吼神庙的宗教底色还是尬...
再说神器作为未知之物（媒介）和归一是互补的，但再整个设定框架下神器的存在被远远淡化了，于是我开始思考整个故事最后的高潮要回到太空史诗歌剧这个玩家对游戏的感受，这就引出了我最后的观点——

最后是平淡的结局，我对此表示理解，设计立意已经逃不出这个归一和多重宇宙循环的框架了，导致路只能这么走，这  就是概念先行的结果！你们没有把视角聚焦在具体的人物——主角（玩家）身上，虽然玩家从一开始所扮演的小矿工是极其具有Bethesda“个人飞升”特色的主角，但故事其实没有什么力量。
既然是太空歌剧和史诗为什么不作一个简单而有力量的结局，神器的铺垫——源自于人类已探索过的星系之外，宇宙之外，主角在某种机缘和群星伙伴的帮助下接触了这种“认知之外“，就像我们此时此刻地球人可能在未来接触某种未知一样，主角团窥见这种未知后要一起研究谜团，玩家作为主角的选择会导致不同的结局。
如果我充满信念和勇气，我可能作为先驱，再次踏上我作为人类向前探索的步伐，有可能我回不来了，我在宜居星系做任务的过程中的感情线，玩家和群星可能要考虑很多，要不要带上爱人或信赖的队友，玩家“我”是怎么看待这件事的？同生共死还是不想把好人拖下水？这取决于玩家的性格和对话选择，那么当我做出这个决定与好友、组织势力一一道别后踏上征程，对应游戏结尾的星图和BGM，这是不是人类勇气的赞歌？也回归到了”人“本身，对宇宙探索需要的勇气。
如果我对此比较麻木，觉得活在时代下的现实世界不易，或者你接受了游戏塑造很好的npc建议，与众人道别的会不会是巴雷特？莎拉？或其他人，玩家处于目送的人群之中。
这其实就是整个游戏的基调问题，“个人飞升”的主角光环走着设计好的路线但偏偏感受不到自我存在。游玩体验没有浩大战争可以理解，但战斗也没有，bilibili的up主已经用电子斗蛐蛐的方式证明，如骇兽大举入侵的百人大战场面是可以实现的，Bethesda没有做。
Main idea of the text    AI-T
First, regarding the overall worldview and in-game content: The United Colonies (UC) Vanguard quests walk you through humanity’s interstellar colonization history—covering the apocalypse, conflicts, and insect infestations (key context for later)—culminating in factions like the UC, Freestar Collective, Ryujin, and Crimson Fleet. Initially, this works, but a major flaw emerges: agriculture. How can humanity build cities like New Atlantis or Neon, yet abandon farming and live like post-apocalypse survivors? Did we lose all seeds/tech when “Mother Earth” fell, with no progress since? Cities feel like illusions—and modders fixing this says it all.
Why, in a Starfield where time bends (e.g., the “Entangled” quest), didn’t Bethesda let players use an Artifact to experience Earth’s destruction? Instead, we jump to a wasteland, read logs of humanity’s mistakes, and stare at a ruined NASA. I suspect they couldn’t (or wouldn’t) do it. Even if “humanity learns nothing from history,” letting players witness our past wouldn’t harm the story—how know where we’re going if we forget our roots? This ties directly to the agriculture gap.
Second, the multiverse and Artifacts: Using a multiverse is fine, but it’s wasted on the cliché of “multiple versions of me.” Why not use it to highlight the universe’s vastness? Bethesda clearly chased “space opera” mystery, but its “Unity” feels unromantic—I only felt it during the final faction farewells. What is Unity? It’s not scientific (e.g., micro-particles) or Taoist; given the elder in the final quest, it’s Western philosophical/religious “oneness”—hard to grasp because the multiverse overshadows it. We’re too busy choosing between Starborn Hunters and Emissaries to care.
Artifacts bring another issue: Western works over-rely on “religion” and “family.” I accept “family” (crew as family), but religion ruins the sci-fi core. It may resonate locally, but globally? Future civilizations won’t revert to primitive worship. The main quest also has broken triggers—conflicting with faction quests, and absurd UC Commander design forcing players toward the Crimson Fleet. Unlocking Starborn Powers (space “Shouts”) is great, but the temples’ religious vibes are cringey. Artifacts (as Unity’s complement) are also underdeveloped—undermining the “space opera” feel.
Finally, the underwhelming ending. I can understand this: the core design concept is trapped in the framework of Unity and multiverse cycles, so the story can only follow this path. This is precisely the result of prioritizing concept over execution! You failed to focus on the specific character—the protagonist (the player). While the player starts as a lowly miner, a classic Bethesda protagonist archetype built for “personal ascension,” the story itself lacks emotional weight.
If this is supposed to be a space opera epic, why not create a simple yet powerful ending? The Artifacts could have been foreshadowed as originating from beyond humanity’s explored galaxies—beyond the universe itself. The protagonist, by some chance and with the help of their Constellation companions, could come into contact with this “beyond comprehension” force—just as humans on Earth might encounter the unknown in the future. After glimpsing this unknown, the protagonist’s group would work together to unravel the mystery, with the player’s choices leading to different endings.
If I were filled with faith and courage, I could become a pioneer, embarking once again on humanity’s journey of exploration—knowing full well I might not return. The romantic subplots from quests on habitable planets would add depth here: the player and their Constellation companions would face tough choices—should they bring a loved one or trusted teammate? How would the player’s “self” view this? Facing life and death together, or refusing to drag good people into danger? This would depend on the player’s personality and dialogue choices. Then, after saying goodbye to friends and factions one by one, the protagonist sets off—with the game ending showing a star map and background music (BGM). Wouldn’t that be an ode to human courage? It would also return to the core of “humanity”—the courage needed to explore the universe.
If I were apathetic, feeling that survival in the current world was hard enough, or if I took the advice of a well-written NPC, maybe Barrett, Sarah, or someone else would be the one saying goodbye, with the player among the onlookers.
This all boils down to the game’s tonal issue: the protagonist has the “personal ascension” aura and follows a pre-designed path, yet the player barely feels their own existence. I can accept the lack of large-scale wars, but there’s barely any meaningful combat at all. Creators on Bilibili (a Chinese video platform) have already proven with “digital cockfighting” (simulation videos) that large-scale battle scenes—such as a massive Terrormorph invasion with over a hundred combatants—are achievable.

Then it released and I was playing day one of release. When I sat in the captain's chair and fired up the ship for the first time, I was over joyed! 

Fast forward 506.1 hours played in the game. 

Do I still get excited? Sure, but less so now because I know most anywhere I go I have seen it many times before due to the cookie cutter plants and POIs. I also know that I am going to have to save often so I can reload when, not if, a glitch happens to break my game. EXAMPLE: Just last night I couldn't get into the lodge because the doors were stuck. I had to log out and back in to get them to work. 

Now there are creations and while some require to be purchased, there are some that do not. Have I paid for some? Heck yeah I have. Not only do they enhance my game play QoL, but it also supports the creators and encourages more content. Right now, I have about 20 mods on the game and it has made a huge difference in how the game plays. From planet bioms to different POIs and NPCs, the creator content definetly is worth the price if you read them and they interest you. 
Some add brand new stories and missions with new places, armor, and weapons. While others add to or enhance existing features. 

The base game is good, but it isn't great or fantastic. It has many issues such as flying corpses when you kill someone or AI glitches with your companion getting stuck somewhere because pathing isn't working (I mean they won't even jump over a rock). 

Bottom line is that Starfield isn't perfect by any means nor is it God aweful bad either. It is a game worth playing especially if you like Fallout or Skyrim style games. It is open world, some choices matter, and it has spaceship building! :) Could it be better? Of course, but that shouldn't stop anyone from at least getting in and immersing yourself in the main storyline and enjoying the game and if you want to spice it up a bit, head into the creations and pick up some goodies. 

Above all else, just have fun and enjoy playing it. After all, it is just a game.

Starfield,1716740,206911066,"Oh me, oh my. I never wanted to make this review. Especially with that red thumbs down you’re seeing. 

I am going to be perfectly clear—319 hours speaks a lot for how entertaining this game can be for someone like me, a Bethesda fan. However, I want to stress that just because the game was entertaining for me, and I was able to find a good level of fun within this game, does not at all mean that it succeeded in the areas in which I have labeled. The points listed below areas of the game where I was consistently telling myself felt incomplete my entire time playing this game. While I refuse to outright call Starfield a ""bad"" game. I will call it a game that has failed to live up to the Bethesda formula. Especially where exploration is concerned.

I loved the idea of this game. But as it sits today, Starfield has failed expectations for me (and many others) in three large ways.

One: 

Space exploration is nothing but loading screens attached to loading screens attached to menus. This is NOT Bethesda DNA. I have been hearing many rumors that this will be changed soon, and if they do, this review will reflect those changes as soon as possible. But as of right now, they have FAILED at space exploration. The ship is a glorified fast travel station/storage home. While that is not in itself a bad thing, a huge idea that most people had in their heads was that you could explore the contents of each star system without a loading screen or a menu. Obviously, when you go into a planet, there will be a loading screen. But, a more engaging experience would allow players should be able to fly throughout the star system without fast traveling and encounter a random event naturally along the way. This would feel more natural to Bethesda’s formula, and I feel it is the direction they should have gone for success for a game like this. No one should have expected Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen. But at the very least, bombarding the player with constant menus to navigate ruins the experience.

Two:

I could EASILY forgive the repetitious planetary exploration if it were not for the fact that the space exploration was so incredibly limited. Simply put, I have never noticed the repetitious dungeons of Oblivion or Skyrim. But in Starfield? It was more than simply noticeable. It was blatant and in my face within 5 hours of playtime. 314 hours later, I yawn at these buildings and places that I have been to hundreds of times over. I am not at all saying some repetition is bad; of course, not every single interior is going to be 100% unique, but I think that the simple lack of any variety ruined the ground exploration experience for me.

Three:

The final point is purely subjective. The narratives in this game lacked the iconic feel of their past titles. Skyrim, Oblivion, Fallout 3, and even Fallout 4 had great stories and narratives that were at least engaging and interesting to see to their completion. To make this point clear. I am over 300 hours into this game, and I have not completed its main story. The story did not at all grab, entice, or interest me. I call this my subjective opinion because I think many people did enjoy this story. 

Maybe this review will change. Maybe it will not. But I hope it does. I loved the combat in this game, and I loved the art. I adored the soundtrack and ship customization, and while I would recommend people try it if they are die-hard Bethesda fans, I cannot recommend this game to people who are looking to get into a good space RPG. It simply failed in every aspect that has made Bethesda special in the first place. While there will be those people who whine and cry about how this game did not do anything innovative, I don't think it needed to. I do not think every game needs to be groundbreaking and a technological masterpiece. It just needs to be fun, engaging, and interesting, and Bethesda’s Starfield simply fails in these categories where it counts.

I hope they read reviews like mine and take them to heart. This review comes from a childhood fan of Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3, Skyrim, and Fallout 4.

Starfield,1716740,206821800,"Originally, I thought Starfield was a fairly average game, a 5/10.

But the more I played it, the more I realized that the game isn't well thought out enough in many ways, so it's currently a 4/10 in my book.

----------

The straw that broke the camel's back was outpost building. Now, as someone who has seen multiple engineering/automation games, Starfield utterly fails at making a satisfying experience setting up bases to extract resources from.
1. There is no easy-to-access central hub where you can view all your outposts and cargo links and what they're mining
2. There is no sorted storage (ie. Iron-only storage, Chlorine-only storage) which means that you WILL run into bottlenecking issues at some point when it comes to storage.
3. It is not fun to mindlessly run across a randomly generated surface map looking for good spots to make an outpost. There should be a resource map on the surface map, similar to how it is in planetary view. I am true gamer nerd, it is in my blood to look for the most efficient spot to mine from instead of having 3 outposts on one map for 3 different resources.

------

Incidentally, while Starfield does a good job of handholding for very casual gamers, the holes will quickly become apparent to anyone who likes to experiment.

GUN BALANCING
I have never used a Kraken pistol in all of my hours of playing the game. Never. It was always worse than any gun I had on me at any moment.
The guns are horribly balanced. The automatic weapons usually were worse than their semi automatic counterparts. Sometimes I just really want to unload bullets but you know, I only have so much ammo and I don't want to spend time and credits to get more when I could be saving up for new ship parts.
Automatic guns SHOULD carry similar DPS, INCLUDING RELOAD TIME, to their semi-automatic counterparts. It's especially true when you consider that it's easier to get headshots on semi-automatic guns because of recoil.

--------

Skill perk challenges actually provide no real value at all. First off, 90% of the time they're not challenging. They just...happen to be there. But they also make it so you are gated from actually leveling a skill until you have completed the associated challenge. So they essentially force you to grind meaningless tasks just so you get to feel stronger the way you want...which is a bit antithetical to a true freeform RPG.

Also, skills suck. I am not excited to level up so I can get +10% handgun damage. The skill upgrades should genuinely feel meaningful. Leave the damage in the hands of weapon mods and crafting. Skills truly shine the most when they introduce meaningfully interactive gameplay while staying simple.

---------

The main story writing is quite mid and very cliche, the characters are not very memorable even though they do clearly have some vision behind them (ie. Barrett is wisecracking space rogue, Vasco is funny robot man). The characters just feel a bit too safe, as if they were all handcrafted so they would all be unoffensively likable.

----------

The following is not really a detailed criticism, but it's a necessary one to make because of the feeling it evokes: there are too many loading screens.
If you're going to make a freeform space RPG, you're pitting yourself against other space sims out there which handle immersion much better than Starfield does. I'm aware there might be tech restraints but it really does feel like every area is a loading screen, including your own ship.

I don't know how to solve this specifically, but the ratio of meaningful gameplay to loading screens is too low.

--------

Finally, gunplay and swordplay.

Gunplay is fine, very average.

Swordplay is...kinda mediocre and slapped together. Almost feels like they added melee just in case people wanted to be a sword swinging space ronin, but then the devs forgot the part where they actually had to make melee more engaging than ""I hold forward and press left click multiple times."" There's no point in blocking with a sword. Just left click until you are done.

---------

This kind of covers much of my complaints. Starfield is basically a really cool vision with disappointingly mid execution. I hope that for their next game, the devs really try to figure out what makes a game fun for someone who isn't just a very casual player. I think the best milestone to show that they can figure it out is if I no longer feel the urge to mod my game after 30 minutes.

Starfield,1716740,206737564,"It's a good game. I have to give it a positive review, since herd-like consumers have taken unrealistic stance on it, and the statistics of total reviews do not reflect reality.
 I will try to give a fair shot at it.

First, there is a plethora of negative reviews from people who have played the game for many hundreds of hours, per player. That is multiple times the game length of a single-player campaign standard (for a LONG game: +20h). 
You can experience all the mechanics, main features and gameplay loops in the first few hours. 
What then, drives people to invest hundreds more, and leave a negative review? 

For example, I tried to play Death Stranding, I tried my very best to ""get into it"" but it's not for me. It seemed an interesting game, but the mechanics wore me down. It just wasn't enjoyable (for me). Didn't take me 200h to realize that.
 
I have done multiple runs of Starfield now, and I clock in 170h. One vanilla, other runs with mods. 
I cant, for the life of me, imagine a game that would take me 200h, or 100, or even 50, to realize it's not for me. 

There is no other game this much review-bombed, and still having people played it these amounts. Did someone make them do it at gunpoint?

I have played several other ""space sims"", No mans sky included. To me, no other game has the stories like this has. It works alot better that Star Citizen, for example. Yeah, Starfield has bugs, but the state of SC is so bad, that to me (and many others) Star Citizen is nothing more than a glorified screenshot -simulator. 
No mans sky works good, but it just has no depth to it whatsoever. Not even after the so called ""redemption arc"". Yeah, it has gazillion planets (all similar and boring) and yes, it has in-game transition (no cinematic like in Starfield). Thats good. Still, to be frank, the only clear advantage is exactly just that; the landing / taking off -planets. And thats it. Everything else is shallow in No mans sky. It feels cookie cutter to me atleast.
Star Citizen shouldn't be even talked about, since it doesn't even fucking work 30% of the time, depending on what you are doing. You know what I'm talking about, if you have played it. 

 Starfield has its faults. No doubt. 
Those issues have been covered extensively by many. There exists real and valid criticism presented by people possessing fair judgement.
Most of the negative reviews are not that, however, and most ""low-effort bethesda-hate-bandwagon"" -content made by social media creators is not that either.  

I do believe, if Starfield was made by unknown studio and without years of hype, it would be showing alot more ""positive"" -review status as of this moment. 
It isn't the best work of Bethesda, it has many game design issues, for example. It is not a perfect game. 
It isn't the unplayable, broken mess (which it is portayed to be) either. As we can see from the 'played' -hours of the negative reviewers.

There is the bones of a great game here but a lot of the execution is severely flawed.

The world itself feels...empty. Populated places are unique and interesting, for sure, but outside of the handful of populated places you go there's just carbon copies of the same set of pre-generated structures over and over and over again. There's no reason to go there and do anything with them other than to grind skills. 

Money is kind of meaningless because you can usually craft or find better things than you can buy and materials are all over so there's rarely a need to purchase any. Doing things to make money is also sort of pointless because of money sinks that area in place.

You could be a pirate and hijack ships...but then you have to pay a registration fee to register the ship before you can sell it and that fee is most of the sale price so you've made no money. Ships rarely have much valuable cargo so there's not much point in stealing it plus the cost of bounties will very quickly outstrip any profit you make from piracy.

Without going into spoilers, the New Game + mechanic is genuinely an interesting bit of writing but it feels like they took that as an excuse not to do as much. The way its presented feels like it should add more but it really doesn't and then you realize you can blast through the entire game in less than an hour just to have everything reset and you get to do the exact same things over and over and over again. Sure you can do them a different way but there's usually not that much of a different way to do them.

The rewards for a New Game + also mean that a lot of your skills become kind of useless. You don't really need to modify suits or ships anymore since you get one of the best one of each in the game. 

The biggest issue is the lack of Workshop support and the lack of mods in general. Vortex is an option and it works well but a game like this is absolutely screaming for a huge modding community. There's hundreds of empty planets and places with nothing that could benefit from people making up cool new places to explore or see and there's just...none of that. 

If you do go for mods, absolutely one of the first ones to get is a mod that removes or makes much easier the lockpicking minigame. It brings the game to a crashing halt and takes way too long. Before I modded it out I was actively avoiding lockpicking things despite having the skills because the minigame was just so annoying. 

The bottom line is I reached the bottom of what this game had to offer well before I was finished playing the game. The poor mod support means there's not much flexibility in expanding it.

Starfield,1716740,206373980,"It's all been said a million times already, there are countless videos online about the many issues with this game, so I won't really get super into it.  The short version is this: Starfield takes no risks and is not interested in delivering ANY kind of experience beyond killing time.  The systems are shallow and disconnected, like they were made to simply say they exist.  It doesn't try to specialize in any one thing, and as a result every aspect of the game is shallow and un-engaging.  Whereas a game like No Man's Sky put all its effort into the procedural generation of planets and none into the spaceflight, combat or story and a game like Elite Dangerous put all its effort into spaceflight and ship combat and none into ground gameplay, Starfield puts no effort anywhere.  Neither space gameplay nor on-foot gameplay rises above ""serviceable"" in quality, and the writing for quests and NPCs certainly doesn't save it either.

Starfield really is only good at one thing, and that's being a second-screen game.  Normally how it works is you play a game and have a video or something playing on the second screen to occupy your ears, but this is the reverse of that.  If you have a video or podcast or whatever that you want to pay attention to but want to keep your hands busy, Starfield is what you put on for that.  I initially played this game on gamepass and only bought the game on Steam during the sale with gift card balance, which is really the only way I'd recommend you buy Starfield: as cheap as possible and not with your money, and only as a glorified fidget toy.

Starfield I think really puts the spotlight on Bethesda.  There's been a discussion for years about if Bethesda really is capable of making a game the quality of Morrowind or Skyrim anymore, especially after Fallout 4 and 76, and I think Starfield really was the last chance for most people (myself included).  At this point, I have no good expectations for Elder Scrolls 6, and it's going to take a lot for Bethesda to convince me they're worth taking a look at going forward.  They need to rework their process, it's just not working anymore.  Skyrim's magic is now nearly 15 years in the past, you can't keep expecting people to pay for your games purely on that memory and expectation.  I know that sounds kind of dumb from someone who just gave them money for this game knowing full-well its quality, but there's a difference between a bored person buying a year-old game on-sale with a gift card and someone actually wanting to buy a brand-new game on launch with their salary money.",False,5,4467

The game’s underlying themes are presented in a bland and trivial way. Locations are uninteresting, main story has lots of copy-pasted segments, dialogue is generic and dogfighting among other minigame-like features is underwhelming. Exploration means clicking a fast travel point in your menu apart from those generous situations where there is actually two clicks and a loading screen in between.

The games understand the passage of time, and passes a rough amount when using fast travel, just make it pass more if over encumbered.

Starfield,1716740,206011935,"I'm so disappointed in the new game+ system, it seems so out of place for a Bethesda game. Where as a game designed around the creation and maintenance of bases around the universe, where the long game is to build collect build collect only for the new game to happen and start over. I would have preferred the differences that occur with new game+ to maybe I dunno.. be a random start game, would be interesting for everyone to have a different experience.

I still had some fun in Starfield, some stories were really cool, still a good game in my book but such a lost potential. I hate that you have to skill up so hard to build a ship, some systems were weird.

I'd also like to congratulate on a reasonable stable release.

As for NG+
Most who play elder scrolls or fallout franchise will actively start our own new game. To actively try something new, we often load an old save to keep going for that gameplay, NG+ to this day feels like a big hit and miss feature 

I don't know my feeling are so mixed on this release.

Starfield,1716740,206008035,"[h1]💭 Final Thoughts – 9/10[/h1]
[b]After fully completing it (mod-free), I can confidently say: no, it doesn’t quite match Skyrim’s magic, but it delivers a solid Bethesda experience with unrelenting force![/b]
[b]Starfield doesn’t always know what it wants to be — part space sim, part action RPG — a bit like Lydia. Sometimes you’re having a blast together; other times you want to Fus Ro Dah the other half into oblivion 😤. It does a great job, but falls short of becoming that timeless, endlessly re-re-released classic.[/b]
[b]If you’re patient, love slow-paced exploration, and get excited by creatively “realistic” planetary discovery, this is a great experience. If you get bored or annoyed easily, or prefer fast-paced gaming, this might not be for you.[/b]
[b]In a way, it really was StarRim… Ew, I mean… SkyField! Yes SkyField, and I loved it! 🗡️🚀[/b]
[hr][/hr]
[h3]🕹️ Gameplay – 8/10[/h3]
It’s that Creation Engine jank we know and love, but improved, refined, and more immersive than Skyrim. Movement, combat, and interactions feel noticeably better. Shooting is definitely fun.
Realism adds a new layer: sprained ankles, back pain, broken bones, coughing — it’s real life! But with more space dust [i]cough cough[/i]. I dumped points into health skills early, which helped with that a lot. And if it gets too annoying, you can tweak difficulty sliders to suit your vibe.
Oxygen management is frustrating… but not as much as inventory management. It’s tedious, but hey — eventually you’ve got to clean your room. Flight and combat are simple, fun, and engaging. Customisation? Robust. Plushie-filled beds for happy time? Done! Alien egg ambushes waiting for Sarah in the bathroom? Also done!
I just wish there was more variety in suits and clothing. I wore the same set for hundreds of hours and I didn't even shower.
Oh and Chunks are nice! Chunks are really nice!
[hr][/hr]
[h3]🎨 Graphics – 8/10[/h3]
The game is beautiful. Just… don’t stare into people’s eyes. Feast on cityscapes, vistas, and skies. Really, just don’t look at people.
Important NPCs look great. But the everyday Clinty and Natty? They wandered in from a wax museum that forgot to pay its lighting bill.
[hr][/hr]
[h3]🎵 Sound & Music – 9/10[/h3]
Atmospheric and perfectly tuned. Combat feels epic, and when you reach a mountain peak with two moons hanging over the ring around Uranus 😏 — it just hits.
Sound effects are crisp, voice work is varied and memorable. Adam Jensen dropping remarks, Cisco Ramon musing about the universe. It’s those little moments that make the world feel alive.
[hr][/hr]
[h3]📖 Story & Characters – 9/10[/h3]
The main story is great, but only as deep as you make it 😏. Talk to people, dig into dialogue, explore your surroundings, and uncover a lot of hidden lore. Rush through it, and it might lack depth.
Characters follow the same pattern. You can breeze past them, or dive deep and genuinely care. The main companions shine — and get to know them you should. Feel for them you should. Fall deeply in love with them you should. Because… well, I’ll never tell! 🤐
[hr][/hr]
[h3]⏳ Replayability – 8/10[/h3]
Feels like launching into Skyrim, with side quests, exploration, space flight, good times. But Starfield adds a clever New Game+ that’s not just “play again,” but a fresh experience with new twists and incentives — if you’re not fried after hundreds of hours 😅.
It rewards curiosity and commitment. A bit like your commitment to Lydia… I mean Sarah… I mean… 🙊
There’s more than one playthrough here — if you dare to find out.
Mods! Dare I say more? No! Mod the space balls out of it, because you can!
Best part though? You get to eat more Chunks!
[hr][/hr]
[h3]📈 Learning Curve – 8/10[/h3]
Lower the difficulty sliders and it’s a gentle ride. But play with all systems active — injuries, inventory, crafting, farming, fighting, exploring, researching — and it’s like enrolling in Space University.
Thankfully, the game guides you reasonably well. And the best part? You don’t have to do everything. Pick what you enjoy, ignore what you don’t. It’s a sandbox, not a syllabus — and nobody’s grading your space potatoes… Or are they? 🥔
[hr][/hr]
[h3]🫂 Multiplayer – 10/10[/h3]
The only real multiplayer element I found was the girlfriend laughing at me because I screamed, “Fudge! I have a brain haemorrhage again!” 🤯
[hr][/hr]
[h3]⚙️ Performance – 7/10[/h3]
I’ve played extensively and haven’t hit many issues. Starfield can be heavy to run — city hubs hit the GPU hard with visual complexity and global illumination, while NPC simulation and AI scripting can hammer your CPU.
Use upscaling and frame generation if you can — it helps. I’m on an RX 7900XTX with an ultrawide display, so it’s been smooth and beautiful. Like, space-poster-on-your-wall beautiful. I know that’s not everyone’s setup, and Starfield can be demanding, but with the right tweaks, even mid-range systems can shine.
Most major issues are patched, but bugs can still pop up. For me, one quest completed, but its marker lived on forever. Save often, and treat your save files like precious cargo. 🧳💾
[hr][/hr]
[h3]💰 Value for Money – 10/10[/h3]
Starfield is vast and expansive, and if you’re okay with patient play, the value is solid. Take it slow, soak in the details, and you can spend months here.
It’s not about rushing to the credits — it’s about wandering, wondering, and occasionally yelling “Why am I farming space potatoes again?” 🥔 The value is there… if you’re the kind of player who likes to earn it.

I felt the story was too forced and it took me away from the ""space fantasy"" that I wanted this game to be. However, now that I've returned to it (this time on PC) I feel that my mentality about the game has shifted. Instead of going for the main missions and trying to follow the crumbs layed out by Bethesda, I decided to go and explore my own universe. To do this I just decided not to help the Constellation, at least not initially. In my own head cannon my character had been following rules for all his life and this time was the first time that he could be free. So I turned around, picked up my ship and explored the universe. This made the game more interesting and allowed me to build my own narrative. I ended up becoming a bounty hunter and spent most of my time in a colony supporting their people. Due to an accident with one space pirate I saw my self being forced to improve my piloting skills and spend money on upgrading my shit if I wanted to continue to help others. This was a lot more interesting that anything else I had experienced before. Will it make sense once I go back to the main missions? Probably not.

There’s something oddly beautiful about Starfield. You stand on a barren planet, the stars stretching forever — and all you can think about is how many loading screens it took to get there.

It’s not a bad game. It’s just… a quiet one. A massive universe that somehow feels a little empty — like a space museum where you can’t touch anything.

But every now and then, you see a sunrise over a crater, your ship gleaming in the distance, and for a brief moment… it clicks. You remember why you keep playing.

Starfield,1716740,205921160,"[h1] Ale się zawiodłem [h1]
Pytanie brzmi: dlaczego? 
No cóż liczyłem na pełną wrażeń opowieść, niczym w Skyrim. Dostałem? Dziwną konwersję Fallouta4. (Nawet niektóre dźwięki  były wyciągnięte prosto z Fallouta) i to najbardziej mnie zabolało. Po wyjściu Starfielda marzyłem o tej grze i kiedy udało mi się ulepszyć sprzęt na tyle ,żeby ta gra spokojnie poszła na najwyższych detalach........ no i marzenie zderzyło się z rzeczywistością. Gra do której (jak mi się wydawało) będę wracał i przerobię w niej lekko 400h................... Sprawiła że po 1 ukończeniu gry w ustach pozostał mi metaliczny smak. Gdybym miał wrócić do Starfielda... to na prawdę musiał bym nie mieć co robić. 
[b] Klasycznie lecimy z plusami i minusami [b]
[h2] Plusy [h2] 
+ Bardzo fajne bronie ( ciekawe) wraz z ""przyzwoitym"" systemem dodatków do broni (gripy/ celowniki/ tłumiki i generalnie wszelkiej maści hamulce wylotowe etc)
+ Świetny system budowania statku ( spędziłem chyba z 15 godzin na 105 rozegranych żeby dopieścić swoją latającą fortecę [spoiler] może trochę przesadzam z tą 15 ale z pewnością dużo godzin i to satysfakcjonujących upłynęło mi na przerabianiu, poprawianu i ulepszaniu statku [spoiler]
+ Pierwsze zderzenie ze światem starfielda robi przyjemne wrażenie
+ System walki jest okej (w sensie walki i strzelania) [spoiler] mimo ,że czuć w nim tak dużo fallouta [spoiler]
+ Główna linia fabularnia jest też w porządku mimo braku rewelacji pojawia się kilka ciekawych Plottwistów
+ Fajne frakcje w sensie fajnie wyglądają 
[h1] MINUSY [h1]
-Postacie poboczne są.... ależ one są obrzydliwie nudne.... bo leci to tak. Poznajesz postać X i ma ona swoje powiedzmy usposobienie. wystarczy ciągle dawac 1 opcję dialogową ( pełną współczucia i empatii i klepania po pleckach) i sobie nabijamy tę ""pozytywną relację""
- System ulepszeń pancerza [spoiler] o kur*a [spoiler] po za ulepszeniem statystyk... nic się nie zmienia. Jak by fallout przyzwyczaił mnie że kiedy daję sobie dodatek do pancerza dajmy na to jedno z kilku ulepszeń to chociażby kolor tego pancerzyka się zmieniał
- Mimo kolejnych wersji pancerza wszystkie wyglądają tak samo nie ważne czy to pancerz z 1 poziomu czy z 50 [spoiler] znów fallout przyzwyczaił mnie do tego że w późniejszej części gry dajmy na to pancerz X dostaje nowe elementy jak płytki ochronne albo kolejne części ochrony klatki piersiowej i tutaj tego brak a to ogromny minus który właśnie odbiera urokowi wizualnemu tej gry [spoiler]
- w moim wypadku ta gra trafiła do kategorii ""przejdź i zapomnij""
[h1] PODSUMOWANIE [h1]
Generalnie starfield nie jest złą grą... jest grą która w moim mniemaniu jest za mało dopieszczona w pewnych kwestiach.
Postacie poboczne nie wzbudziły mojej sympatii ,jak działo się to w skyrimie czy F4.
Najważniejsza rzecz która reguluje moje podejście względem gry to jest to czy warto kupić ją za pełną cenę a tutaj [h3] definitywnie nie warto [h3] ,wydając kasę bez promki i to takiej conajmniej 40% to ta gra nie jest warta tych pieniędzy. Ale mimo wszystko myślę ,że znajdzie swoją niszę która będzie spędzać w niej po 400h. Niestety ja do tej grupy się nie zaliczę. 
Mimo wszystko to dobra gra którą warto ograć [spoiler] tyle że na promocji [spoiler]

Starfield,1716740,205888655,"Surprised how much I'm loving the game so far going by the reviews these days 

(Do we really take notice of reviews anymore? I know I don't which has me wondering why I am bothering doing one myself)  

And the comment section... well I'm pretty certain quite a few have mental issues... its just senseless ranting over pixels but others make good points about their criticism. 

I am currently playing a modded version, I haven't tried the vanilla version but I'd have to admit if it wasn't for the mods, quite a lot about the game would have annoyed me, resulting in me uninstalling. 

So far I have 80+ mods to turn the game into a living breathing RPG that requires me to eat/sleep/drink/pay taxes/crew/crew food/fuel/maintenance costs/repair parts and a tonne of other features that adds so much more to the already enormous amount of content.

AI mods have made the enemy excellent and I'm playing on the hardest settings... they are actually slick I have to admit, quite a few of them know how to stage an ambush or hide... other mods have fixed POIs and added more variety etc, so I won't be suffering from copied and pasted encounters.

Without mods I would have down right hated space in this game but with Astrogate that lets me actually travel across a system in my ship with the added bonus of autopilot, ship boarding mods where enemies will close in to board (AWESOME) then with fuel and subsystem mods... I have a fully functioning space ship that I can walk around in, a Cargo bay I can walk around in with or without cargo being present while having to do manual maintenance that require spare parts to complete the repairs, cook food, work on benches or study the system map while in transit or be the pilot myself. 

Everything I dreamt of having the ability to do in Elite Dangerous... not to mention build the ships too... It's  what space fans have always wanted. 

However... they really dropped the ball on space travel and how important a captain can interact with their ship is... I hope  they fix this because mods went far and beyond towards addressing this. 

They could also add in trade routes between planets, possible encounters, radio signals, distress signals, Search and Rescue ,space horror, crew/ship events to deal with... They don't have to be constant every Kilometre throughout travel (That would be awful) but just make it a possibility of happening is enough.  

Maybe new ship combat too that is modelled more towards submarine warfare instead of dog fighting... (Like combat in The Expanse, the dog fighting could be used to fight off a boarding attempt)

If asked to describe the Starfield I'm playing I would say... Imagine The Expanse and For All Mankind mixed with Alien Covenant, planets that would remind you of Riddick and Firefly include hunting (I have it modded where animals are scarce so I have to look for them, they also drop meat which is why I hunt) that reminds me of Jurassic Park... but in the form of Fallout 4 in Space. 

Those thoughts crossed my mind when playing, I just thought to myself its awesome. 

Loading screens... 1-2 secs... 5 seconds when starting the game after logging on... I counted and I continue to count to this day and I think I always will, people are either extremely petty, need to upgrade or the game has been updated to shorten the loading screens because 1-2 seconds is nothing... I forgot all about them. 

(Well when you go to land on planets reminded me, the sudden switch from gameplay to the screen then the landing cutscene... they should include a cutscene of the approach to the planet) 

I'm only 17hrs in, the story and writing is typical Bethesda, it won't win awards for cinematic's and the writing will get the point across before unleashing you into the sandbox to proceed how you like... I think its ok, I'm enjoying it. My focus in the game is making money so I can get a crew so we can put a team together to then capture bounties, put them in a brig and send them to prison... I'm a long way away from that but its my goal all the missions and story content is just a bonus waiting for me to try when I'm ready. 

Would I recommend it... with mods absolutely... (A list of mods should be suggested to install for the best experience)  I'm loving it at the moment but as I write this, aside from fast travelling everywhere, I have no idea what people do between getting to and from missions... they're missing out in so much. 

Hopefully Bethesda fixes this",True,1,6325
Starfield,1716740,205882737,"How much I was looking forward to Starfield... 
I had such high hopes for the creators of Skyrim and Fallout. Worlds that invited me to explore and made me forget the passage of time. 
But ironically, the strength of the previous titles is my biggest criticism of Starfield. Apart from the numerous loading screens, the endless galaxy with it's more than 1,000 planets, is alarmingly empty. Realistic, yes perhaps... but how are you supposed to lose yourself in this world? Whereas in Skyrim I only reached my destination after hours because I was distracted by Dwemer caves, random side Quest's, or dragons along the way, the journey through the Settled Systems is enormously underwhelming.

The visuals, however, more than satisfied me. Sure, there are prettier games, but the ships, equipment, worlds, and people looked amazing. If only they weren't so incredibly soulless. These puppets, with their lack of character traits and unbelievable wooden dialogue, which are supposed to pass for humans, shock me deeply after experiences like Cyberpunk or RDR2.

After enduring one more dull quest with its illusion of choice, I gave up on Starfield around the 30 hour mark. 

I still hope Bethesda will awaken from their creative slumber and, much like CDPR, deliver a 2.0 update that pulls Starfield out of its pit of disappointment.

A galaxy promised, yet never revealed,
A dream of the stars, but the cosmos is sealed.
To soar in your ship? a screen takes its place,
Immersion is shattered, no journey through space.

Endless transitions, a cycle that grinds,
A frontier of loading, not worlds to find.
The guns speak in echoes, familiar, mundane,
An engine of old still tethered, unchanged.

If Fallout in space with barriers galore
Is the kind of adventure you’re searching for,
Perhaps you’ll endure the illusion they weave,
But for seekers of wonder, best turn and leave.

Starfield is a game that has an extremely wide reach, with the depth of a puddle. I don't even know where to start complaining about this pile of garbage. You can't fly your ship around the planet, you just land it in a fixed spot in a procedurally generated wasteland that might have some things you can footslog to, look at and maaaaybe even shoot at. Maybe. Space flight is a waste of time too, you don't actually get to move around the planet or system you're in. You're basically flying in a big empty box that might have space pirates in it. You can't land on the planet you're visiting, you do it all through fast travel menus. Sometimes you'll find an asteroid field. Crash your ship into one of them and see what happens (Spoiler alert: NOTHING!). This game is fucking stupid, designed by stupid people. Seriously wasted potential here.

Crowds are basically the same 20 npcs copypasted over and over again that have no dialogue aside from ""hi"" or ""hello."" Remember how Skyrim's cities, almost all of the NPCs had names and were all involved in at least one quest or relevant to a story somehow? Not anymore, those days are long dead and over. You get generic NPC slop now. Enjoy it!

And I'll probably build more ships in the future. but I do not recommend this game. if you want to put hours on end into Bethesda. elder scrolls or fallout will give you a lot more story to be happy with, do not go into this game for a good story and great npc's there's only a hand full",False,8,64198
Starfield,1716740,205768925,"The big feature with this game is the Creations store. You spend real money, to get ""credits"" that are used to buy paid mods in the store. Of course, the amounts you can buy credits in, are not multiples of what the paid mods cost. So you have to always buy more credits than needed.

Some of the paid mods are good. Some are complete garbage. But the fact is you always have to buy more credits than you need. So you can end up with quite a lot of credits. I had a lot of credits, while waiting for something worthwhile to spend them on. In a fantastic example of anti-consumer behaviour, these ""credits"" have an expiry date. A date that you can not see anywhere in game.

Imagine the happiness and satisfaction I felt to log in and discover all my credits have expired.  A shame because I found something I had wanted in the Creations store. Obviously, that's not going to be purchased now that Bethesda has stolen the credits. Clearly they must be so hard up for money, that they have resorted to stealing from customers. That should give you an idea as to the actual state of this game. If it was actually good, they wouldn't need to steal from their customers.

Considering how many bugs and problems I have encountered in Skyrim, Fallout 4 and Starfield, I was genuinely surprised to see that this expiry system appears to be completely bug free. It clearly shows where the bulk of development went in this game. I have to applaud the development team for proving that if Bethesda wanted to, they could create bug free code.

the settings lore is actually pretty interesting and has alot of potential with the multiple factions with centuries of pretty interesting lore but unfortunately as stated bethesda gets pretty lazy even when they have a really good foundation of lore to build off of which kinda ruins a large premise of the game since while there are hundreds of worlds to explore 99% of them are just procedurally generated iterations of each other so that gets bland pretty quick and they went with arguably one of only 2 story lines in all of gaming that are pretty much impossible to pull off in a satisfying manor when the game is an open world non linear players choice rpg. 

the only reasons i would really recommend this game are for 1 the side stories are, as per usual with bethesda, arguably better than the main story and DEFINETLY more rewarding (my fellow pirates know what i mean), the game play as stated before, and finally and also as per usual the insane modding community which only continues to get more impressive as time goes on with mods like star wars genesis doing complete overhauls of the story and world itself to fix some of the core issues with starfield although i would like to point out that if you decide to buy this game for that reason it in a sense encourages bethesda to stay lazy with their writing and just pump out more money by taking mods into creation club and just relying on modders.

Starfield,1716740,205720315,"I’ve got about 18 hours in now, and while I’m enjoying parts of Starfield, it’s definitely a mixed bag. The visuals are gorgeous, the gunplay is fun, and scanning has honestly become one of my favorite features. It’s not just filler; when you scan a plant or creature, you get little bits of info about how it fits into the ecosystem, and that adds a nice layer of lore. It actually makes exploring planets feel rewarding beyond just collecting loot.

But a lot of the world feels flat. Most NPCs come off as bland and copy-pasted, with only named characters having even a touch of uniqueness. It doesn’t really feel alive the way I hoped it would. The constant loading screens don’t help either. I don’t mind loading when traveling between planets and space, but every single building needing its own load screen breaks immersion fast. Skyrim modders had fixes for this back in 2014, so it feels wild that a studio with this kind of budget didn’t tackle it.

On the RPG side, the dialogue feels thinner compared to past Bethesda games. You can be a little rude at times, but there’s no real villain path or “bad guy” roleplay. Companions especially push back against any violent approach, and after a while it feels like the game is steering you into one “correct” way of playing. I’ve ended up soloing missions just to avoid their constant complaints.

Overall, Starfield nails the visuals, the shooting, and that classic Bethesda exploration loop, and I really enjoy scanning and uncovering bits of hidden lore across planets. But it’s dragged down by lifeless NPCs, way too many loading screens, and shallow RPG elements.

There are however some serious flaws, I apologise in advance if my comments upset any true believers and fan boys out there.

You soon realise that every planet (almost) has identical locations with loot in the same places, sort of get this, to make them all unique on a game of this scale would be prohibitive in time to create. It does get a little boring though.

The game regularly freezes, loses sound, or crashes completely, normally at a bad time.

The REV, what can I say, it is better than walking and that is about it, all but uncontrollable on snow type ground, when jumping it has an incredible ability to land in a tree or hit a rock, it is meant to be an off road vehicle, all I can say is thank goodness Bethesda staff were not involved in designing the Land Rover car.

Space suits, by their very nature they are sealed systems, so how the hell can you get a cough?? I could understand the suit getting damaged, but a cough because of caustic air? 

The shattered Space DLC was welcome and top notch, I would like to see the next DLC to be along the lines of ""Naeva Mora returns"" or ""Naeva Mora is back"" She appears to be heartily disliked by all and sundry on the forums, however we must not overlook the fact that all of her dialogue responses are written by the Developers (she is not a real person) so you would never get a reaction from her other than what was programmed. Her plans for revenge on the UC for killing Jasmine and to a lesser level Delgado could be epic.

Starfield,1716740,205444310,"This feels less like a game made by a team that has made 3 elder scrolls and 2 fallout game and more like a team making their first game.

Exploration: needs a pretty big overhaul. Having just one big procedurally generated map for each planet with POI's moved closer together would be preferable (imo) to the infinite empty maps the game generates. Loading screens for space travel also need to be replaced with cutscenes of the players ship transitioning in/out of atmospheres and traveling through the warp tears would lessen the break in the game flow.

Gathering: Too much useless junk in the environments that creates excessive clutter making it easy to miss actual useful crafting materials. All useless junk should be able to serve as crafting materials to lessen time wasted examining everything, ya know, like it was in Fallout 4.

Crafting: is very wasteful, mods should not be lost when replacing them. Either the resources for the previous mod should be refunded (unless the new one is a clear upgrade), or the mod should be removed and placed in inventory/storage to be sold or attached to other weapons/armor.

Spacesuits: These need to be heavily streamlined so the player doesn't need to carry multiple (one of the heaviest items in the game) or just find themselves screwed in certain situations. All Environmental Hazards should simply be protected against by spacesuits, only being issues if the player has none or suffers a suit debuff during combat. i.e punctures or tears in the suit allowing lesser environmental damage through until its repaired. Suits should also just focus on physical defense with beam defense being handled by a dedicated mod slot that can be upgraded or replaced with better shield mods to increase energy defense.

Settlements: One of my favorite mechanics from Fallout 4 has been ruined in this game. The main uses for settlements is to gather resources. While the quantity you can get is good it often requires half a dozen settlements on a single planet to gather all it's resources which then has to be repeated on dozens of planets to establish a decent mining network. While this is time consuming to setup it is also a massive resource investment itself due to the structures you need to build and hiring staff to work the colonies. This can be easily streamlined by just letting the player mine for all available resources on a planet from one settlement per planet.

Story: Without any spoilers the story is designed to push the player into constantly restarting into newgame+'s for random loot. While you don't HAVE to do this it is still poorly designed considering the rest of the game is designed to encourage you to explore this large sector of the galaxy, but then you lose everything you've done and have to redo it which will get tedious if you do go with the story's intended goal.

Final Verdict: The game has plenty of good ideas that could make for a fun experience for those who want a more story focused space experience similar to other Bethesda Games. Spaceship customization is the best mechanic here (Even No Man's Sky has copied it now). Side content continues to be more interesting then the poorly written ""main"" story. But all of the games systems and mechanics seem to have also been built in vacuums disconnected from each other with no clear or even logical flow to how they supplement each other. Why invest in crafting when your constantly going to replace your upgraded weapons with ones that have random modifiers you cant craft? Why explore and build settlements to gather resources to lose all of it on a Newgame+?

While i often enjoy adding mods to Bethesda games to enhance the experience, this is the first time i've felt a desire to make an extensive overhaul of the entire game. I know Bethesda is working on improving the game but without a complete overhaul that would likely break all existing save files i don't see how this game can be salvaged to a fun state. Maybe in 25-30 years when they make Starfield 2 they'll be able to pull everything together more cohesively.

Starfield,1716740,205261736,"Enjoyable game, with a fun and engaging story. 

The story stakes some enjoyable turns and along the way you are required to make some challenging decisions.

The game feels good,

Who parts of the game that I feel are a bit lack lustre are the worlds you explore - all feel mostly the same and I would say they were procedurally generated opposed to being hand crafted - an example of this is the loot in hidden areas. It seems like an algorithm chooses what you get and its mostly quite disappointing. This leads me to believe that nobody placed the items in the world for you to find and feel like you're figured something out. The other part of the game that didn't feel great are the Starborn powers you unlock. They all feel a bit meh.. to me. Also, the process of getting the powers looks really cheap and is poorly executed in my opinion.

I paid 69.99 Euro for the game and played for 77.5 hours. That works out to .90 cents per hour of game-play. That's alright in my book, its less than a Euro an hour, which I tend to regard as the start of the pricey side.

---

Small Note: I went back to No Man's Sky after finishing Starfield and the amount of similarities between the two makes me a bit uncomfortable. Feels like some things we're down right lifted from No Man's Sky. I wish Starfield had more of No Man's Sky's seamless space travel to planet side travel; that would have been really nice.

I like Starfield. I've played through it a couple of times by now and often get the itch to play even more. I enjoy the theme, the quests, the music, and the gameplay. While I certainly had a lot of little pet peeves when the game first launched, many, if not all, of them have been fixed by now. It scratches the space exploration itch slightly better than No Man's Sky. 

The biggest drawback for me is the lack of unique locations and POIs. The major cities are cool, as are the unique POIs, but outside of that, you only see a randomized mix of stuff when exploring. If you ask me, the game would be significantly better with more static places to visit.

It's as if bethesda unlike the games I love only put half the time into the stories, quests, factions and general variation of content,buildings and ""dungeons"". It becomes the same sh** over and over very fast.

Starfield,1716740,205199003,"Alright, so here goes.

I've played this game for significantly more than 339 hours. I actually started playing Starfield when it launched on Gamepass, and then ended up purchasing the game later on Steam. There is a whole process for converting your save game data from xbox to PC. I believe I had roughly 120 hours into the game before I decided it was wise to make that transition. 

With that said, and I cannot stress this enough, base game Starfield isn't very fun. Sure, it still kept my interest for awhile, and I know for others it scratches certain itch, but it does get outshined by other games in nearly every category. The game that most closely resembles Starfield but is better in every way (except for combat) is No Man's Sky, and it's not even close. The ONLY advantage this game has over No Man's Sky is the combat system, because No Man's Sky (NMS) has a near non-existent combat system in its game, or at least it did the last time I played it. 

Whether it's base building, exploration, interesting sites, secrets, ship building, quests, or multiplayer, NMS has base game Starfield blown out of the water. Now, I give this game a positive review simply because of mods. Were it not for mods and the creation kit, this game would not be nearly as fun or keep feeling ""fresh"" to me and so many others. The notable mods I have installed that keep the game fun are downloaded through Vortex from Nexusmods.com, as well as a few from the Creations Kit. 

Enhanced Combat, Energy Shields, Additional Missions, Enemy modifiers, Enemy overhauls, Ship Builder tweaks, Boarding encounters, player ability overhauls and additions, armor & clothing sets, companion overhauls are the kind of mods I have installed. The most important mods are the Enhanced Combat, Energy Shields, Additional Missions mods, and I will explain why.

After about 30 hours into your first run, you may start to notice yourself getting very strong, and neigh unkillable to anything on 2 or more legs. After about level 70, you're functionally a god and can't be killed by anything but your own hubris. Doesn't sound like such a terrible deal, right? Wrong. It makes the game very unfun after that point and normal people would lose interest rather quickly. The Enhanced Combat and Energy Shield mods I have installed fixes that issue. The Enhanced Combat mod changes your maximum health pool to 400 instead of allowing you to get to ludricrous numbers even as high as 15k. Some enemies can also get extremely beefy without this mod reducing their maximum HP. With the Enhanced Combat mod installed, it makes it so EVERY encounter with enemies no matter what level they are can be deadly. To place it into greater perspective, 400 maximum HP is a very low number, and it makes it so you can use just about any vanilla weapon in the game and be competent in combat. For the higher level/rarity weapons, you will find yourself 1 shotting enemies with automatic rifle fire...but the same can also be said for enemies to you. The risk of yourself getting 1 tapped by automatic fire is also VERY high, and makes it so you have to play far more tactical than before, almost like you're playing Rainbow 6 Siege.

To help alleviate the ""issue"" of fights taking extremely long to fight through because you get 1 tapped so often, the Energy Shields mods comes in clutch. Energy Shields stops yourself, and eligable enemies from getting 1 tapped by any weapon damage, which is also fully customizable how strong the shields get, and how often enemies will have shielding active, and if it's enabled by default before combat starts or not. If you have it toggled like I do, it allows for you to play stealthily when clearing dungeons, allowing viable stealth gameplay.

With Additional enemy modifier, and additional missions modifier mods, it's something that I feel should have been including in the vanilla game. It increases the enemy count by 10x, and missions by about 10x, as well as mission slates that can be picked up from random enemy corpses. It significantly raises the immersion of gameplay and helps the game to be filled out and look nothing like the ""dead game"" so many people say it is. Having massively enhanced enemy numbers also of course makes the game significantly harder, and helps you level up much faster especially at the later glory levels (150+).

Vanilla game for Starfield when it comes to customization is only somewhat good for Ship Building. It becomes very clear however that there are a couple of weapons that vastly outshine others, and its not even situational. NMS ship builder is a bit better, but the truly massive distinction is the usage of the player home/outpost building. In Starfield, building an outpost is almost completely useless unless you want to use 1 outpost to expand to another planet and use another. For some, I'm sure that's fun, but for people like me that don't enjoy playing farming simulator with dead outposts, it feels dumb. In NMS, your outpost building actually means something and has a large impact on the game. Also, you have an incredibly higher degree of customization for your outposts and can make your player homes truly impressive and then show them off to the player community. 

I could go on for much longer different pro's and cons to Starfield or even No Man's Sky, but I think you get the point. If you're going to buy Starfield, I highly recommend a PC purchase and get ready for some heavy modding for it to be a fun game.",True,43,20313

Starfield,1716740,205120203,"I like this game. I like the settings and most of the dynamics. The only thing that disappoints me, is the building dynamics. I 'liked' the way the walls and floors/ceilings 'snapped' together. I also liked that you weren't limited to a select few prefabs that you could build with. I've tried building custom buildings or just adding walls to some of the unfurnished prefabs. But when they didn't snap into place, I found the buildings leaked like sieves on planets with toxic atmospheres. I was actually kind of hoping and expecting that Bethesda was going to use the same building mechanics as they did in Fallout 4, with different, more futuristic skins on the building parts, hence my disappointment. I kind of hope they do something about the building mechanics sometime soon, to make it easier to build bases.

I know it sounds like I'm shooting down this game. But I really do like it actually. I like the open world play and the base story line. I also like all the different adventures, missions, and exploring available that are available.  I would also like to get into the resource economics system a little more. Hopefully, Bethesda will do something to improve the building mechanics to make that a little easier.

Anyway, if you enjoy open world games with multiple gaming styles, then I think you will enjoy this game.

Starfield,1716740,205117952,"When this was being hyped back in 2023, I was looking forward to playing it, then I saw some of the system requirements and I was concerned that I might not get the full experience. So I decided not to buy it but it did make me get a really good SSD drive and a 3 month Microsoft Game Pass so this allowed me to at least trial it for 3 months. I have to admit at the time, I hated it. Graphically poor, buggy and it all seemed like a Fallout 4 rip off (Fallout 4 is in my top 5 of games).

A few months back the game was on sale and after GFX upgrade made earlier in the year I decided to buy the premium edition (it was only (£29), and boy was it the best decision I have ever made, to the point that Starfield could very well be one of the best games I have ever played. Its clear that this game is not for everyone and there are parts of the game that I am not a huge fan off, but I tend to find that it a lot of my favourite games.

I have yet to complete the main story line but so far I have enjoyed what I have played although I have tended to focus more on the side quests were are amazing, such as the story line of the Terrormorphs which clearly has been influenced by Starship Troopers. I like the Outpost building elements of F4, and that has transcended into Starfield. My only gripe with this though is that there are loads of cosmetics missing such as bathrooms even though they feature through out the game on NPC outposts and towns. A minor gripe.

I like the weapons on offer in the game, and there is enough customisation to allow you to play to your style, some of the creation mods also add a little more flavour to this so its worth checking out. The game is also visually stunning if you have a reasonable GFX card, especially when in space. When it comes to exploration I feel like this could have been a really cool Star Trek game as it has everything you could possibly want. Its also clear that there are so many references to the world of SciFi, such as the Disney movie Black Hole as well as the classics of Blade Runner, Aliens and as said earlier Starship Troopers. Some have complained that there is a lack of sentient alien species that ruin the game, well why does there need to be? After all the Alien Verse and Starship Troopers doesn't, even shows like Battlestar Galactica and The Expanse doesn't, so to me that is a mute point.

One thing that I don't think works, at least not well is the introduction of vehicles. You can't customise the one you can get and there are no more you can buy unless you get them via creation mods. Driving is also crazy and I had to make so many tweaks to the controls to get it right for me. Again a small annoyance and once I hope gets looked at in the future.

Setting Expectations

Starfield has taken its fair share of criticism, much of it familiar to anyone who has played a Bethesda RPG before. Complaints about bugs, loading screens, or repetitive quests tend to follow every release. As a long time Bethesda player, I see Starfield less as a flawless new beginning and more as the next logical step in their formula. If you come in expecting Elder Scrolls VI levels of hype, you’ll be disappointed. But if you approach it as a cosmic sandbox in the Bethesda tradition, with all the quirks and strengths that implies, it’s easier to appreciate what it does right and forgive what it doesn’t.

Empty / Repetitive Worlds & Planets

General criticism: planets feel copy-pasted, exploration isn’t rewarding.

My take: Starfield’s procedural system isn’t aiming for the infinite variety of No Man’s Sky or Elite Dangerous. It’s closer to Bethesda extending the world building of Fallout 4 or Skyrim outward, using procedural methods to generate wilderness beyond handcrafted hubs. Land in a biome like “swampland” and it will look familiar no matter where, but the game is pulling from a large procedural pool. Each planet map is divided into regions where the game generates explorable tiles on demand. It’s less about infinite novelty and more about creating Bethesda-style wilderness wherever you land. Most remote areas hold raider camps, mercenary forts, or the occasional Starborn ruin or Terrormorph cave, much like stumbling upon a random cave in Fallout. The system keeps exploration consistent without becoming overwhelming, and the handcrafted Settled Systems remain the real highlight.

City Design

Bethesda’s cities in the past have often felt too small or compressed.

My take: In Starfield, the city design is a leap forward. Akila City is much larger and feels like a believable city rather than a compact hub. New Atlantis stretches across a large worldspace with towering skyscrapers and hubs of activity, giving it the presence of a capital. Together they create settlements that feel more like functional metropolises than compressed quest hubs.

Excessive Loading Screens & Transitions

General criticism: constant loading breaks immersion.

My take: The loading screens in Starfield follow Bethesda’s long established rules for worldspaces. Entering a ship, docking, or moving between planetary surfaces and interiors always triggers a transition, much like entering a building in Skyrim or Fallout. The difference is simply frequency due to the galaxy’s scale and layered travel systems. Once you understand planets and cities are modular worldspaces stitched together, the loads feel more like Bethesda’s philosophy applied to a bigger canvas than a flaw unique to Starfield.

Main Story / Narrative Weaknesses

General criticism: bland or generic story, characters underdeveloped.

My take: Starfield is best approached as an open ended narrative sandbox. The main quest carries the gravitas and drama of Skyrim and veers into metaphysical territory, but it’s more a canvas for your role in the Settled Systems. Character creation supports this by giving backgrounds and traits that shape dialogue. The story shines less as a linear epic and more as roleplay freedom: you can be a cyber runner ronin for Ryujin, or a Flash Gordon style gunslinger for the Freestar Collective. It really is Skyrim in space with Fallout 4 style crafting, and New Game Plus even lets you subvert the main quest for replayability.

Performance, Bugs, and Tech Issues

General criticism: buggy launch, performance issues on some hardware.

My take: Starfield is a technical leap over Fallout 4. You could even see it as a working demo of the Creation Engine 2. Bethesda could have polished more, but if your system meets the specs, performance is stable. Post year one, the game is far more stable than older Bethesda launches. Modding support has already improved optimization and bugfixes, much like Skyrim’s ecosystem. I don’t meet the official system requirements, yet with mod optimization and lower environment textures I can still play. The game can run on Fallout 4 level horsepower, though it’s more resource heavy due to asset streaming and higher fidelity.

Repetitive Missions / Busywork

General criticism: quests feel like chores or filler.

My take: By around level 40, you’ll likely have wrapped the main quest if you beeline it, but the game is built for a slow burn sandbox. Unlike Fallout 4’s defined role, you start with miner origins until you become Starborn. That open endedness mirrors Skyrim, where the main quest is only one thread. Repetition sets in if you only chase big set pieces, but embraced as a sandbox, the design makes sense.

Lack of Depth in Certain Systems

General criticism: shallow NPC behavior, combat repetition, loot reskins.

My take: I won’t lean heavily into system depth, since I was modding them right away. That’s typical for Bethesda. The base framework feels underdeveloped in places, but with mods the systems quickly become richer.

Expectation vs Reality / Marketing vs Experience

General criticism: game didn’t live up to the hype, not revolutionary.

My take: Starfield launched with hype like Elder Scrolls VI, but it shouldn’t be judged as that. It’s a standalone franchise and a technical preview of what Elder Scrolls VI will likely run on. As a Bethesda toybox—part narrative playground, part sandbox, part crafting—it scratches several gaming itches even if not revolutionary. It sets the stage for the future while offering its own flavor of storytelling.

Cost & DLC / Value Concerns

General criticism: DLC pricing vs content value, some issues remain unaddressed.

My take: The base game is worth it for the modding potential alone. I never felt I missed anything by skipping Shattered Space. I liked Andreja and House Va’ruun lore, but the DLC feels worth it only on discount or for mod framework needs. With about 50 mods, the base game already transforms into something sweeping.

Closing Thoughts

I recommend Starfield for anyone who enjoyed Fallout’s weapon crafting and settlement building. Bethesda needed more time to polish its systems into full sandbox features, but shipped an RPG as is. If it had leaned harder into those systems and their accessibility, it might have launched with a clearer identity. Still, that flexibility is its strength. With a light modlist, a mediocre game becomes an engaging toybox where you can roleplay, build capital ships, or just take a stroll through the Well.",True,2,9277

The story is forgettable at best. 

The gameplay just is not fun. It felt like a chore to play. I was constantly waiting for it to become fun, it really didn't happen. 

The overall design at first appears mediocre. Then I go play cyberpunk and realize the design isn't mediocre, it's actual dog shit. Lifeless NPCs, souless settings, the dark and grittiness it sometimes tries to depict looks like a neutered Disney version of dark and gritty. 

The rpg elements are atrociously boring.

The main story is decent, but just like in every Bethesda game, it’s really the side quests and faction quests that shine. The UC Vanguard line in particular hooked me, and I found all the faction storylines to be engaging.

Ship building is another highlight, the sheer freedom to create whatever you want is amazing. You can design sleek vessels, bizarre frankenstein monster ships or anything in between, and they’ll still fly. Outposts are also a neat feature; they’re as simple or as detailed as you want, especially if you enjoy decorating.

Visually, the graphics are fine, not great not terrible.

What did disappoint me a little were the procedurally generated POIs. After a while they start to feel repetitive and soulless, no matter which planet you’re on. I really wish these areas had been handcrafted instead, because that would have made exploration far more rewarding.

On the positive side, companions are fantastic. Sarah and Vasco became favorites of mine, and traveling with them made the journey feel more alive.

Mods are a game-changer. StarUI is a must, and with a bunch of mods installed the game instantly feels so much better.

I understand it may not live up to some people's expectations, and I can also understand that the pace of the game (slow at times) may put some people off. But to go so far as to call it a scam, a disgrace, or whatever... that's just dishonest.

I loved the atmosphere from the very start, and immediately felt immersed. I was amazed by the environments, during space exploration or on the many (too many?) planets. I enjoyed some excellent stories scattered throughout the galaxy. I spent hours creating or modifying my ships, and took great pleasure in wandering from planet to planet to discover their secrets.
There are flaws, of course. The companions are too bland/similar, the weapons and equipment could have been more varied/original. And many planets feel too empty, even useless.

But the biggest issue in my opinion is that I would have liked more. Even more quests, even more types of starships, even more companions, cities, factions... And in my opinion it's not a real flaw, it was just good enoough for me to want to play longer and discover more things. Plus well, there's already a lot.

The writing is sophomoric and predictable, the characters unbelievable and frankly boring, besides Andreja. Any serious moments are undercut by weirdly out of place sarcastic humor. You often have no dialogue options approximating how people actually talk to each other. 

The tone of the game and dialogue is juvenile. It seems like they did a second pass through the entire game to make sure nothing could possibly offend anyone, as so many themes and plot points teeter on the edge of real gravity and should be handled with maturity are instead childish and bland. The game is rated M, but all the dialogue and characters are rated E, its very anachronistic and immersion breaking. The in game pirates act like middle school bullies in tone and speech, which is entirely at odds with the reality of people who survive by piloting ships through space to victimize innocents at the risk of the own life. 

The main story is bland and uninspiring, the loop is self defeating, the meta narrative actually discourages engaging in the NG+ mechanics, the side factions quest lines are dull and juvenile without any real stakes to 3/4 of the available factions. The Freestar Rangers are an offensive patische of US western culture that could have been done very well but seems undercut by present day biases and lack of stakes and player agency. 

The gunplay is the best feeling BGS has accomplished so far, however the overall combat experience is dull and unserious due to the bullet sponge issue. 

The Starborn powers are literally the Skyrim shouts, with like three original ones. 

The space combat is boring and requires mods to make it anywhere close to engaging.

The exploration loop is fun at first, and while the game is capable of great vistas and photographic moments, the random POI system is an absolute dud, especially due to POI weights meaning that you'll visit the same exact 10 POIs across the majority of the breadth and width of the galaxy. 

There are functionally no survival mechanisms in a game about space exploration and survival. Starvival fixes that, but its an absurd oversight. 

The four main cities are too small, Whiterun seems larger than Akila city.

The Creations store is predatory and host to a variety of reskins they want you to pay $10 for.

The alien wildlife generation is elementary and uninspiring. There are zero mammalian type creatures across the galaxy, everything's a bug or dinosaur or a mix between the two.

You can't go underwater. You're wearing a space suit, which astronauts train in giant pools with in real life, but you can't go underwater anywhere across the galaxy. 

While you can download 200+ mods to make Starfield into a fun game worth playing, never before has BGS fumbled so hard in so many areas across the game. Don't buy it until it's less than $20 USD, that's the value I'd pay for vanilla Starfield now having put so many hours into it. 

I have lost faith in BGS as a studio, and now fear the ES6 will be as large a disappointment as Starfield. Todd has lost his way. Emil should be exiled. The studio itself engages in inflammatory and divisive social media rhetoric pertaining to outside current day US politics which is abhorrent and unneeded.

There is a LOT to forgive here, and some of it is a mixed bag. The main quest is pretty unsatisfying, and the promised exploration of difference after completing the main quest is laughably small.

Starfield,1716740,204754929,"If you were anticipating Skyrim in space, then you may be disappointed to know it's 50/50 at best (or worst).
Here's a few pluses and minus' that I personally feel might be relevant:

(-) You get the same intermittent, annoying, funny and sometimes game-breaking bugs.

(-) You get to enjoy deadpan delivery of what, on paper, you'd expect to be an epic space-opera or journey.

(-) Enjoy Fallout 4's same two combat music tracks that played in the Commonwealth when in a fight? We have that here too. The Theme is serviceable in its own right, although besides the main menu and specific scenes you might not hear it very often.

(-) Enjoy an EULA which basically forces you to agree that the $70, 125GB application on your hard drive is indeed not yours.

(-/+) Space combat was (mildly enjoyable), when there was ever more than 2-3 enemy vessels at a time; which when you get mid-to-late-game modules and weapons said battles will be over way too quickly.

(-) The weapon variety tries, although due to the fact weapons don't particularly scale, you'll likely loot a high-DPS weapon off a mini-boss or high-level zone and just make that your new, permanent primary. If you don't then you'll quickly notice how fast enemies become spongy to damage as you progress outside the starting area.

(-) Weapon upgrades are tied behind multiple skills- which wouldn't be so bad, if it wasn't for the fact that compared to Fallout 4's system is INCREDIBLY grindy at times. Many will point out guides on the University of YouTube/Reddit, however if I have to follow a 15-minute guide on how to cheese the game balancing or XP grinding, then why would I even try to play legit in first place? I like to cheese when it's for fun, but not if I am obligated to avoid a 10+ hour character grind right at the start.

(+) The graphics are pretty. I mean, in the wild areas the landscape generation can look a little funny if you have things scaled down, but it's evident they at least tried to make something visually appealing. This is definitely a game that shines when the settings are topped-out, but certainly not on the lowest values.

(+) The sound design, when it works, is tickling to the 'tism. Guns sound punchy, ship engines sound crispy, etc.

(-) The sound design, when it doesn't work. If you're not running a beefcake rig, then when in areas with a lot of explosions, gunfire, enemies etc. you may notice some audio may cut out or not play at all. Definitely circumstantial, but still jarring nonetheless. In more extreme cases, I've personally had to avoid using headphones in certain areas due to 'popping' or crunchy sound effects that sometimes take place which can be generally unpleasant when using surround sound or Dolby/Atmos.

(+) I found the ship construction and modification to be entertaining. Out of my 67 hours, at least 33 hours of that was me making unreasonable vessels and screwing around with different set-ups and styles of cabins. There could likely be more freedom in how it's done, but considering this is one of the first games they tried this with, it's serviceable enough. There are plenty of Workshop/Creation mods that rectify this by including more modules, tweaking or removing sizing limits, etc. My personal flavor of autism is spaceships and spaceship customization- so I am likely biased when I glaze this point.

(+) The Creation Mods. There are a lot of tweaks that make this game a bit more enjoyable, or fix known issues. Community made cosmetics are also appetizing. Very nice.

(-) The Creation Mods. A lot of the larger or simply cooler files and tweaks cost points. Which cost real money. Not nice. Forgive me if I do not enjoy modding my $70 game with $20 worth of points to download a fist-full of mods that I think would make me enjoy the game a bit more (personal preference).

(-) The loading screens. I'm sorry, but dear god the loading screens.

(+) Gay Space Cowboy romance is possible with a character voiced by Elias Toufexis if you chose a male character. 
(Because we know you wanted to bang Adam Jensen from DE:HR) Just what Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger fought for.

You know, despite the memes, I unironically got a chub at the idea of Skyrim in space.
The TES formula with a space plot/verb swap for the script not only sounds neat (albiet campy), but also incredibly easy. 
So why, pray tell, does it look like they struggled so badly? 
Why does it not have the same magical hold that drew me before?

I'll be honest, it's not even the worst game I've played. 
There were times I got really annoyed, and times where I really enjoyed myself.
It's the price tag.
Prices. Set. Expectations.
When I booted up the game, I was fully anticipating $70 worth of fun- even when a quarter of my C: Drive was molested to make space. Instead I got what I personally believed should have been a $20 Indie spin-off or even a Early-Access beta.

Making something different is good. It's risky. It's exciting. It's beautiful.
But when only half of the effort shows, it has the opposite effect:
It's mundane. It's a bore. It's abrasive.
And that would be fine, except one thing:
125.6 GB base game; $70 Retail price.

I believe video games are like art: they require passion, purpose, fulfillment.
There must be something with soul, something that draws you in; wanting more.
I just don't think we've hit that mark just yet.

Rolled an epic hero with a majestic mullet.
He was an extrovert, a mamma’s boy, and worshipped a snake god.

Started as a humble miner. Found a shiny rock. Touched it. Brain went “woooosh” and suddenly I was the Chosen One.

Met a mysterious black dude and his sassy robot. They invited me to join their “definitely not a cult” space book club. I joined, because free snacks.

Visited my parents — yes, I actually picked that trait. Now I have to pay them an allowance while I’m out saving the galaxy.

At cult HQ I met a space cowboy and his daughter. Also a posh British lady with the accent of someone who’s never eaten a freeze-dried potato.

Teamed up with the cowboy, saved a whole planet of space cowboys, became a Ranger and a bounty hunter, and helped him with his ex-wife drama like some interstellar Dr. Phil.

Teamed up with the British lady, joined the Space Marines, hunted for a cure to a creepy bug, got promoted to captain, saved the galaxy, then married the British lady. “Boinked her a lot for the XP boost” became my main build.

Helped the sugar daddy of the cult build the biggest ship in the galaxy. He loved it. I loved it. It was ugly as absolute space-sin — like a flying space-dumpster with wings — but it was mine.

Met an emo thief chick. Together we stole everything that wasn’t bolted down and then some that was. Saved the black dude from pirates and helped him unlock his own cosmic powers.

Became a First-Class Citizen of New Atlantis and got my own penthouse for saving everyone from the space bugs — finally living the deluxe space-dad dream.

Unlocked even more space wizard powers. Watched my wife die because I helped the cowboy protect his daughter. Attended a Bethesda funeral (awkwardly long load screen included).

Married the emo chick. Put her in my late wife’s clothes. Went on a galaxy-wide revenge spree. Got arrested. Went undercover as a space pirate. Brought death and destruction to the stars.

Got a pardon. Did the good guy act. Went to the Unity. Started New Game+. Saved everyone.

Now my formerly dead wife is alive again and has gone full righteous paladin and gets on my nerves. (Yes, I married her again.) I regret it. They say everything happens for a reason, but now I miss the life I had with the emo chick.

For example: Trackers Alliance(Bounty Hunter faction) questline is whole 1 QUEST LONG, after that it's all just radiant quests with generic randomly named enemy targets. You can make it 2 quests long however... IF YOU BUY PAID MOD WITH IT IN CREATIONS. This is just blatant laziness and greed from Bethesda.

If I bought the game for full price, I would be really pissed off because it feels lazy and unfinished in a lot of places, only to offer PAID band-aid solutions in Creations: Spacers are an extremely generic looking enemy faction, supposed to be this gang of psychos... if you want them to look the part you must buy a paid creation in the store. A lot of convenience stuff such as placing faction mission boards in your outposts is also gated behind Creations store.

There are also missing important features such as being able to personally decide where doors and ladders should be inside our own ship, because the automated way it's done often makes absolutely no sense, leading to nonsensical labirynthine mazes inside your own ship.

The few genuinely good things about the game are the gun customization(Which is just lifted from Fallout 4...), and shipbuilding(Except for aforementioned missing ability to decide where ladders and doors are) which is far better way of making your own personal ""base"" than building outposts(At least in my opinion).

Also as a side note, despite what pronouns in character creator implied, I didn't find too much blatant propaganda in the game, EXCEPT from Trackers Alliance leader obnoxiously making it clear he ""never identified with gender binary"" and likes that his job lets him be officially considered a ""they/them""... which is cringeworthy, but seems like a separated incident, rest of the writing is just boring and uninspired slop.

Starfield,1716740,204626327,"I avoided Starfield when it came out due to bad reviews, but received the game from a friend so decided to give it a go after having it in my library for a while. 

The game is enjoyable, but it required me to change the way I'd usually approach a Bethesda game. The systems in the game seem very disjointed and the progression system is totally broken, which means you can play for hours and level up and barely improve your character, since you only receive a single skill point on levelling up, and all skills require a skill point to unlock and upgrade. There are mods which can change this but I am playing on vanilla with the difficulty settings maxed for the extra XP bonuses. They could easily have improved this system, but instead implemented a ""new game plus"" mode, which doesn't make any sense. 

The story also shoves you in before you've even explored any of the systems or games mechanics, and within an hour you have your own ship and are in one of the capital cities and have many of the companions (this makes hiring crew obsolete before you even learn you can hire ship crew). This seems like poor writing and design as they could have let you develop your character before introducing you to the main quest, allowing you to slowly explore the first few star systems.

There is no karma system or faction reputation that really effects your play through, which for a vast game like this seems like a missed opportunity for a deeper experience, and would have allowed greater replayability. I was also able to simply start the main faction quests without having to first prove myself in any way, which seem a bit unbelievable from a story and RPG perspective. This also makes the ""new game plus"" they added kind of pointless, why would you start again when the play through is not really going to change much?

It seems way too easy to progress and get credits, everyone is just throwing credits at me, making skills persuasion skills seem redundant, since everyone is willing to just hand over rewards. There are so many activities to do in this game to earn credits, but they all seem pointless since credits are just showered on you. It would have been a better approach to allow characters to earn the first ship and make a name for themselves before the main quest pops up. Again the writing seems kind of simplistic and short sighted in what could have been done.

I think they art style and graphics are good. The combat is alright, it would be better but I am limited by the skill progression system, I would have to be level 40 just to have 10 fully upgraded skills - and on the higher difficulty some like fitness etc are a necessity just to be able to function and carry ammo etc. I do find the exploration elements fun, and have done some basic outpost building, again limited by the progression system. The space combat is ok - it feels like Star Wars Squadron style combat, and the random encounters in space have been entertaining, as well as distress calls etc, though space travel eventually becomes a matter of fast travelling - which I don't mind, though all the pointless animations for docking, landing, or even standing up from the cockpit etc become a bit annoying. It would have been more fun to move through space more and encounter things randomly rather than fast travelling.

I am intrigued by the story and faction quests and some of the followers I currently have, so I will likely try to finish the game eventually, though I don't see myself replaying it once I've completed it, which is a shame, as I have replayed all Fallout games from 1 - 4 many times over and same for the Elder Scrolls series.",False,0,2789

You could argue that after 125.6 hours into this game you could say I got my money's worth in entertainment. In some ways, I did, it was kinda fun to explore some of the mechanics - settlement building, ship building, levelling up and getting more powerful weapons/attachments. Ultimately though, they made a massive sandbox, vast and wide with lots of planets - but no content.

I've played Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4, Oblivion, Skyrim (and modded the heck out of all of them). They are a beautiful tried and tested formula. I had such high hopes for Starfield. I watched a reviewer of starfield that made the comparison that every landmark in the other Bethesda games (excluding Starfield) were handcrafted (or at least appeared to be) - usually each having a story, a place in the world. Starfield will have you fly to random star, generate random encounter with pirate ship/other vessel, land on procedurally-generated planet, go to one 6? Maybe 8? copy and pasted points of interest...every ""Science Outpost"" is the same as any other ""Science Outpost"" down to the last coffee cup and scattered papers on the desk... Now take this and multiply this by 100's of planets. Don't get me wrong there's a number of beautiful hand designed places, but even these are hit and miss. Beautiful yes, but devoid of life, and caged within loadscreens. Some are better, Neon and the Mars colony are quite well done. I spent most of my time here as these felt the most alive and atmospheric. I enjoy some of the quest elements, and when they did design specific areas/quests you could see Bethesda shine through - there's one quest that has you enter a 'blood race' which was a race to the death - classic Bethesda. These little custom encounters make me look back at Starfield and remember the good times, but these just make me so disappointed in what could have been. There was a lot of core components/elements that made Skyrim/Oblivion/Fallout so good - but they tripped over trying to make it too big. If you want a procedurally generated sandbox, go check out Empyrion Galactic Survival.

So how would I fix this?
- I would reduce the scope of the galaxy to maybe 5 star systems with a limited number of planets
- Each star system is 'governed' by a specific faction: 1 Western-styled (cargo runners, space cowboys), 2 High-tech explorers (maybe slightly alien/psychic/cyborg? Star-trek style), 3 Militaristic (looking to expand but super strict and rigid to a fault), 4 Zealous/Religious (Looking to bring everywhere else under their fold, has a jedi/force-esque element, but can be overbearing), 5 This star system could be the ""mysterious 5th faction"" which is dangerous to all but doesn't communicate or wish to expand. All other factions will want to explore/conquer/mine/encroach on the planets in the 5th star system.
- As there's only 5 star systems, each with 1-2 planets that you could go on (no you can't go to Venus/Jupiter type planets), they would be a lot more detailed handcrafted with unique points of interests.

I know this has never been a strength of Bethesda, but the gun play is quite bad - you can say that's 'quirky Bethesda' but in this day and age, there's so many other games they can draw inspiration from. I understand they wanted to have unique gun designs but the animations, but full bullets coming out of the shotgun (after it's fired???) - I won't harp on this point, there's a bunch of videos discussing Starfield gun design.

Pros
- Beautiful visuals
- Zero G is fun
- When you stumble upon a unique quest in a custom made area/design it's good.
- Some of the world building was really good, the starborn storyline was good.
Cons
- Something is missing. Planets are empty.
- Copy and pasted points of interest.
- Repeat interactions with space pirates/space police which get really repetitive
- Load screens on top of loadscreens - one of the best parts of Skyrim was you could walk from Whiterun to Dawnstar and all the along the way points of interest, beautiful vistas, quests etc. Starfield you have to loadscreen from city to city.

Starfield,1716740,204489599,"Abominable, reprehensible, and utterly nauseating—Bethesda Softworks has plumbed new depths of ignominy with Starfield, a game so deplorable it stands as a monument to their creative destitution and morally bankrupt ethos. This interstellar travesty is a perilously hollow experience, plagued by monotonous gameplay, glitch-riddled systems, and a narrative so vapid it insults the intelligence of its players. Yet, the true horror lies not in its technical failures but in the vile, stomach-churning behavior of Bethesda’s developers, whose reprehensible conduct in mocking the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk—a real human being slain in an act of political violence—evokes nothing short of visceral disgust.The sheer audacity of Bethesda’s now-deleted X post, showcasing a Starfield character sneering about “fascists” while petting a creature with the caption “good kitty,” is an affront to human decency. Timed mere days after Kirk’s brutal murder, this grotesque stunt reveals a studio so steeped in moral turpitude that it would exploit real-world tragedy for cheap, ideological provocation. The thought of such callous, inhumane behavior—celebrating a man’s death in front of his family—makes my stomach roil with revulsion. Bethesda’s frantic deletion of this evidence only underscores their cowardice, a futile attempt to evade accountability for their perilous depravity.The developers’ actions reflect a broader pattern of contemptuous disregard for the sanctity of human life, transforming Starfield from a mere game into a loathsome vessel for their odious worldview. Every loading screen, every clunky space battle, feels tainted by the knowledge that this studio revels in such despicable mockery. To engage with this game is to wade through a miasma of ethical rot, a prospect so sickening it induces nausea. Bethesda’s hubris has birthed a product that is not only technically deficient but morally execrable, a shameful blight on the gaming industry.Spare yourself the torment of this detestable creation. Boycott Starfield and shun Bethesda’s forthcoming releases, lest you lend credence to a developer whose behavior is so beyond disgusting it defies comprehension. Let them wallow in the disgrace of their own making, a cautionary tale of how hubris and inhumanity can render even the most ambitious projects utterly repugnant.Rating: 0/10",False,22,388

Starfield,1716740,204463548,"I have been a longtime fan of Bethesda. Fallout 3, Skyrim, etc. Their games meant a lot to me. But I can’t stay silent about what’s happened these last few days — and I refuse to give another penny to a company that seems to be condoning or participating in something so vile.

What’s happened:

Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10, 2025, while speaking at Utah Valley University. Authorities are calling this a political assassination. 

In the wake of this, there have been extremely hurtful, cruel, and inflammatory reactions from people online, accusing him of racism, fascism, or worse. Some reactions seem to treat his murder as if it were justified. Whether or not you agree with his politics, this is dangerous territory. 

Most disturbingly, a Bethesda video clip was posted (on what appears to be their official account or closely connected account) that seems to mock the situation. The clip shows the lead character in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle petting a cat and saying, “You don’t care much about these fascists, do you?” after the assassination. That is deeply irresponsible. 

The post was later deleted, but deleting doesn’t erase the harm or the message being sent. Silence feels like consent. And for people like me who are now worried for their safety, being publicly smeared (called fascist or worse) could feel like a justification, for some, for violence.


Why I’m done:

A company should be able to separate its entertainment and politics, or at least handle political content responsibly. When an official account appears to mock a murder across ideological lines, that crosses a moral line.

I no longer feel safe supporting Bethesda. If they can tacitly support or make light of someone’s killing over their beliefs, then nothing feels off-limits.

Trust is broken. Respect is lost. Once you allow this sort of content (or response) from devs or associated with your brand, it changes the relationship.


Before this, I was willing to forgive or overlook small missteps. Not this time. Bethesda has shown that they are not just makers of games, but are willing to sign off on or allow extremely damaging, divisive, and possibly dangerous messaging. I will be boycotting anything connected to Bethesda from now on.

Edit lol:
No Man's Sky easily replaced Starfield for me. Sure, Starfield looks and acts like a Bethesda game, but it doesn't play like a Bethesda game. It plays like a game wearing a mask. Don't bother collecting anything until you've beaten the storyline all 378 times first, because nothing you do before the last run ultimately matters; unless, however you never planned on finishing the storyline even once, which is what I would recommend. 

I don't hate Starfield. It's fun enough to be a game. And maybe with a few mods, it might even be worth playing again. And I don't hate Bethesda, either. Skyrim is God-tier. But you don't have to look any further than Skyrim's, what... 15? releases, to see where the business model is today. They dumped the Oblivion remaster on you so you'd think they were cool again. (here's your actual review)

No Man's Sky on the other hand, functions essentially the same way as Starfield in terms of story - except it actually DOES function. The game has more content now than I know what to do with, and I haven't paid a penny extra for it. It has its share of bugs too, but in fairness, we're competing against a Bethesda game here. Starfield doesn't even have the upper hand on custom ship designing anymore, because you can do the exact same thing in No Man's Sky now, thanks to the latest (literally) free update.

Starfield,1716740,204364092,"Starfield – where do you even begin? This was meant to be the next era for Bethesda. It launched to warm reviews, but was later torn apart by both media and players. Once again, Bethesda has done what they’ve been doing for the past decade: delivering not a perfect game, but a controversial one – and Starfield is absolutely that.

It struggles with issues even Bethesda games haven’t suffered from as much before: loading screens between planets, atmospheres, space, and even houses. This is the most common criticism I hear about Starfield, and it’s not wrong – it can be tough to sit through. But once I started playing differently, only fast traveling from the cockpit and using the UI sparingly, I discovered another side of the game.

When the game forces you to walk through cities and actually explore the handcrafted environments, it becomes fascinating. From New Atlantis with its futuristic feel, to Akila City with its western vibes, and Neon which evokes Cyberpunk and Blade Runner – every location has its own soul. And when you slow down, you start to notice just how much handcrafted content the game hides around every corner.

Starfield is a sandbox. If you go in expecting to rush between quests (and fast travel everywhere) in search of a tightly scripted story, you’ll be disappointed. Starfield thrives when you create your own adventure and use a bit of imagination to fill in the gaps. It was never an easy game for Bethesda to market, but I’d argue they actually marketed it too broadly – and to the wrong audience.

And like all Bethesda games, mods are central. You don’t need them, but they let you shape the experience, either limiting or expanding features to fit your playstyle. If you’re looking for seamless spaceflight from system to planet, Starfield isn’t the game for you. But if you’re after a sandbox that offers interaction, world-building, and adventure in a spacefaring setting – then you might just be in the right place.",True,2,9296

I say this to establish that I have nothing against Bethesda. I am, in fact, a big fan. I love the usual flavor, freedom and even the jankiness that comes with your standard Bethesda title. This one is different. This one lacks the charm. It could stand to lose half the content, half the price, focus on ship building and combat, and with a few mod-sized changes, be marketed as a space pirate simulator quite successfully. 

Why this game isn't good:

While ship building, combat, and similar aspects of the game are pretty great, the rest of the game is like trudging through a desert devoid of interest with added intermittent load times and transition animations. Seriously, average 5 minute game play experiences may include around 1-3 minutes of slow unskippable transitional animations, pestering long-winded-even-if-you-skip-every-line dialogue interruptions, and stuff like trying to figure out why your quest target won't interact with you. If you're not doing that, you're either building something or doing the same combat with the same enemies in the same bunker in 1 of like 4 biomes. 
The main game play is grindy and mostly unsatisfying. After a while, I had to use mods and use console commands to make it fun. The story seems like it was PURELY built around the fact that they want you to do basically the same thing again in NG+ like the story was SOOOO much fun the first time. Hey, you wanna play the game where the point of the game is to play it again but with sprinkles this time, be my guest. That's a weird loop. I don't care if some of the characters (that I didn't care about in the first place) act a little different, or if loot is in a different place, or if the tedious, pseudo-philosophical dialogue has a different flavor. NPC's are either hollow, flat characters or they're a cliche archetype who might as well be a cardboard cutout with a speakerphone attached-- very few compelling characters, but to give them credit, it seems well voice-acted. 
The amount of useful item diversity, including weapons, armor, etc. is seriously lacking considering you've got a large portion of a galaxy to draw from. You'd think there'd be regional variants on things, specializations and stuff, but instead, its usually like 5 base models of spacesuits that have slightly different stats that seem balanced by a live service game manager rather than built from the lore or whatever (seriously the stats on some of this stuff seems randomly assigned or to be ""fair"" and in doing so made everything feel cheap and unsatisfying and immersion-breaking. It's rare you'll get a nice, handy weapon, usually they're trash. Useful gun types are common, but they're still not great unless they're legendary, so even the good guns don't feel like they add to diversity, its just that you now have a real gun. It's like being thirsty while stranded a small boat on the ocean. Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink. 
Vanilla game still experiences classic Bethesda soft-locks from unresponsive NPCs, quest targets not responding, and general CTD style catastrophes. 

The universe itself is pretty! At a glance. They did a mostly good job on pretty much anywhere you have to go for the main quest. All major settlements look great, even though they kinda feel like mostly empty or useless space. They're either too small, or really spread out but have a similar amount of interest. Most curious explorations of urban environments was pretty, but upon inspection becomes underwhelming. Everything looks really good, on the surface, but start to pay attention and it all looks like it was cut by laziness, cost or engine limitations. If you want to swim but can't afford a swimming pool, a wading pond isn't gonna cut it. Maybe they were trying to impress the neighbors. Procedurally generated worlds all feel like the same flavors of ""ugh."" Even when you find a landmark its pretty sad and underwhelming. 

It's not charming like Skyrim was, even on launch. Skip this one unless you really need to play all the Bethesda games or if you really like building and flying sci-fi spaceships. Some really good mod content exists for this game as of posting. check the reviews for shattered space dlc for more details there, haha!",False,8,12804

6.5/10",True,0,4029
Starfield,1716740,204250866,"TL:DR Yes its worth playing once but its replayabilty is soured by being forced.

Starfield is fun and engaging with a lot to offer solo players. Level 200+, unlocked and maxed all powers, stopped counting my Unity runs after 14. (screwed up and didn't unlock every power my first few runs) There are many worlds to explore and replay is fun, however there are some glaring issues with the core endgame mechanic.

To fully unlock and maximize your characters powers, you will need to go through unity no less than 10 times. This is a lot of forced replays just to achieve max power levels. But maxing out becomes about a 100 hour chore even with skipping tremendous amounts of content each unity run. This is separate from character leveling which is also a fairly heavy grind. It wouldn't be so bad if you could take a single ship through the unity. I understand why you can't and it makes sense in game. But there is a strong focus on ships, crew building, and customizing. You get a decent ship called the Starborn Guardian but it rapidly becomes Meh as each unity playthrough progresses. It is very clear, that a custom built ship is the absolute best way to go. However crafting an endgame ship takes time and effort to achieve because the parts are located behind missions and all across different vendors in the galaxy. Having a forced game cycle of rebuilding and destroying a ship that takes hours to construct is beyond obnoxious. 

It feels like the Unity gameplay/leveling mechanic is a terrible idea for an intricate spaceship building game. Or an intricate spaceship building mechanic is a terrible idea for a game with a mechanic like unity. I'm not spending an extra 20 hours per play through hunting out the best vehicle parts all across the galaxy because it turns into a hate filled chore. 

Starfield is beautiful, and empty. Much like the real universe. Which at times is exactly what you want. But there is so much empty on every one of its planets that exploration becomes tedious and unenjoyable. Especially after your 8th or 9th play through collecting/leveling powers.

Starfield is a fun game to play through one or two times but forcibly chokes itself out. Play it to just enjoy the universe and story woven. Otherwise the ""over and over-ness"" of unity will ruin it for you.

That little squiggly button that disables achievements being one hit and done is problematic. Went a long time not getting achievements because of not noticing this.

HOWEVER: most of the gameplay loops are broken in some way, making you lose interest after putting too much time into the game, but also somehow not enough. 

Example: You can capture ships in space, but they are ""unregistered"" meaning you can't sell them until you register them. Then when you sell, you net like 2k credits. absurd. You should be able to go to a pirate station and get a randomly generated mission where you get your ship registered, or create forged credentials so you can pirate and sell ships for profit.

You can build bases and even mine and manufacture everything you need, including animals and plants. However, there's no sorting device that sends resources into a specific crate. Also the storage that links to your ship inventory is tiny and you can only use it to access what's actually in it-when it should give you access to all the linked storages in the settlement.

I would say the game has tons of potential, but it is not worth the $69.99. It is worth $19.99, not unless additional effort goes into making the game a long-term gem.

I don't agree with the overall opinion on the rating of the game, but I can understand a lot of the frustrations other players have. The planets feel dead most of the time unless there is a designed city/location - however if you go outside of the city the planet doesn't offer all that much in terms of exploration. I miss the handcrafted design of games like Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout, etc. and that is where my biggest gripe is with the game.

The travel mechanic feels dull at times when comparing it to No Man's Sky (which may be unfair), but as that game is 9 years old - it's hard not to compare the space travel/exploration vs Starfield's loading screens.

However the game play is pretty solid, some of the story is really cool with Starborn and the endgame loop is interesting. I do enjoy the perk system and weapon combat but i would like to see more unique weapons and impactful legendaries such as with Fallout/Elder Scrolls unique gear.

Starfield,1716740,204156814,"With over 1200 hours in Starfield, I can honestly say it’s the game I keep coming back to. The sheer variety of storylines and side quests continues to entertain me, even after completing the game 23 times. There’s always something new to discover, especially with Creations.

The gameplay is excellent across the board, whether deep in a firefight, piecing together a new ship design, or setting up an outpost on some far-off world. I also REALLY appreciate that the game isn’t filled with constant explicit language.

Another huge plus is the freedom of choice. Being able to shape the kind of character I want to run through is a big reason why the game never grows stale for me. Add to that the Creations system, expand the game with new quests, locations, or immersive tweaks like fuel requirements or ledgers and the replay value just keeps extending for me.

The only part I’ve avoided is Shattered Space. For me, it strayed from the tone that made the base game so enjoyable, forcing a character setup to launch the quest and leaning heavily into horror. It just didn’t feel like the same Starfield I’ve come to love. That said, I’m hopeful future DLC returns to the spirit of the core game.

I know Starfield has received its share of criticism, but to me it’s Bethesda’s best work to date. I may be in the minority, but I’m more than happy to stand by it. For me, it’s brilliant—and I’ll keep exploring its universe as long as it lets me.",True,0,80858
Starfield,1716740,204147219,"Ah yes, Starfield, the game that promised a universe of endless exploration and delivered… entire galaxy’s worth of cargo holds filled with potatoes and stolen coffee mugs.

After spending hours naming my spaceship “USS Midlife Crisis,” I embarked on a grand journey across over 1,000 planets, 998 of which appear to have been handcrafted by a particularly uninspired algorithm with a fetish for rocks.

Gameplay:
It's like Skyrim... IN SPACE. Which means I spent most of my time crouch-walking behind Spacers and aliens, pickpocketing them, and launching them into low orbit with a poorly-timed shotgun blast. The combat feels tight, if by “tight” you mean “occasionally functional and almost never graceful.”

Inventory management is peak Bethesda  within 10 minutes of starting, I was encumbered by three space helmets, a dozen sandwiches, and a priceless alien artifact I forgot I picked up while looting someone's dresser for no reason.

Story:
You're a miner who touches a rock and suddenly becomes the Chosen One, which is very different from being the Dragonborn or The Courier or That Guy Who Took an Arrow to the Knee. The main plot is a philosophical sci-fi odyssey full of mystery, wonder, and the deep existential question: Why does everyone walk like they’re wearing invisible diapers?

Companions:
Your crew includes a man named Barrett who talks like your overly-friendly HR rep, and Sarah, who has all the charisma of a sentient IKEA instruction manual. Romance options exist, but if awkwardly flirting with polygonal coworkers is your thing, might I recommend real-life LinkedIn?

Exploration:
Todd Howard said you could land anywhere on any planet. He didn’t mention that most of them feel like dusty desktop wallpapers with gravity. Still, there’s a weird joy in touching down on a lifeless rock just to mine aluminum or as Americans say, “uh-LOO-mih-num” and immediately question all your decisions.

Bugs:
Yes, they’re still here. Glitches are a core feature of Bethesda’s charm. I once saw a pirate T-pose through my ship’s hull mid-dogfight and ascend into the stars like some kind of space prophet. It was beautiful. I cried.

Final Verdict:
If you love Skyrim, Fallout, and loading screens, Starfield is the space sandbox for you. Just don’t expect Mass Effect levels of depth, and maybe bring a podcast for when you're scanning space rocks for the sixth hour straight.

Overall, it was fun which is what mattered, just a lot faster of a play than I was expecting.

Honest thoughts below: I did buy it for a certain creation whose development I was interested in. I think this game could have most certainly ""cooked"" for a bit longer. It feels more like here's our base game and 1000 DLCs you have to individually purchase for $5-15 each in order to make the game fun. I do like the fact that Bethesda is working with modder's and is open to collaboration. But I would prefer if these cute little extra stories and characters where already included in the base game.

But it turned out to be such a disappointment for me that I uninstalled it pretty quickly. Still, I gave it several more chances, but always ended up feeling the same, until the spring of 2025, when I decided to give it one more try.

This time, I let go of the urge to understand everything right away, and at some point, I crossed that psychological threshold in the playthrough that I hadn’t been able to before. I suddenly felt completely absorbed, captivated, I couldn’t put it down.

I realized that what had bothered me before was my own expectations. But now, I started to understand the story, I could relate to the characters, and an entire universe opened up before me. Planets and star systems were waiting to be explored.

I know some parts of the game are unnecessarily complex, and there’s a lot to keep track of. Not just the skill tree, but ship-building, faction dynamics, and even how different planetary populations react differently to your character. Still, all things considered, it was an incredible journey among the stars, and my heart was longing for a fresh start.

Unfortunately, I didn’t make it all the way to the end, as work took priority and the game had to be put on hold. According to my mission log, I only had one quest left, which I do regret.

Starfield does not have an amazing story or any thing super memorable but it's fun. 

Gameplay-(7/10)
Starfield plays like an upgraded Fallout 4 but it's still not anything impressive. It is fun to go around as a Space Cowboy. 

Characters-(3/10)
No one is really memorable outside of Andreja who is mostly loved by fans and Sarah who will nag you to death. Then you have the Hunter who is who you might become depending on how you play. Other than that, everyone else is mostly forgettable. 

Soundtrack-(8/10)
Typical Bethesda game, Great soundtrack. 

Game Length-(6/10).
I find the game a little short. The only thing that keeps me playing Starfield's NG+. With Starfield, NG+ is cannon to the story and a continuation of things. I have never seen this done in a game before. What's sad is the best part of the game is the end, which many players don't make it to because of the forgettable characters and story up until that point. Iv'e done NG+ over a dozen times and continue to do so. [spoiler] NG+ allows you to play the game again with the knowledge of your previous playthrough. Think of it like a Groundhog Day scenario. You are just reliving the same story over and over again [/spoiler]

Difficulty-(7/10)
Just like any other Bethesda game, Starfield is not difficult. It's simple combat and not much of a grind. But still really fun nonetheless. 

Grind-(NA/10)
Depends on your goal but you will be doing mostly questing and exploring. Everything is easy to acquire.

Graphics-(8/10).
The game has good graphics but most of the time you will not be blown away. 

Audio-(10/10)
No complaints and no issues. 

Price-(7/10)
I think the price is a bit steep for the content but on sale it's worth every penny.

Starfield is probably the most bug free Bethesda game. With that being said, they are still present. I guess thats part of the Bethesda charm at this point.

For a typical Open world enjoyer. The game is not a masterpiece but enjoyable none the less.

So here goes.

Starfield... is the definition of modern game-slob. Everything to become great is there but nothing is designed in a way to have any depth.
You're constantly left with the feeling of 'that's it?'

Leveling is atrociously designed, gating content behind it non-stop. Want to not die all the time in space? Better ensure you've taken the license to fly a decent ship as otherwise you got exactly 0 options to survive when pirates actually come!
But no worries, there's loads of areas to explore, after all it's got over a thousand planets, right?
All of them are basically identical, more so then No Man's Sky in 1.0 was. I think 5 or so randomly generated meaningful places which repeat ad nauseum, with generic loot, generic enemies and generic nothingness inside.

So is the hand-crafted aspect better? The story? The side-quests?
No, not even remotely. Back in the times of Morrowind there were interesting unique scenarios. Starfield offers half-assed boring crap. The main story is really lackluster. There are no stakes at all. Side-missions are all pre-set solutions without proper choice... and if you got em? They have exactly zero meaning going forward, a miniscule change in what's displayed at best.

Ship building? Could've been great! But it's gated by myriads of nonsense, the majority has no meaning and the physics engine will throw around your decorations willy-nilly anyway so it'll stay fully generic.

The biggest variety the game offers is in food items... which are all looking interesting! And all do the exact same 'give back 5 health' thing so any meaning of variety is immediately thrown out the window.

Crafting materials are sorted into categories, instead of getting them you get random crap which has a category attached, making it nigh impossible to keep proper track.

Pinning stuff? Why should we keep track?

Changing locations? Better have 5 minutes of time at hand solely to do that since you'll go through several loading screens and unskippable animations.

Base building? Even if you unlock it you can simply buy everything you want from traders what you would need dozens of hours of barely functional menues to set up... and which then has no use-case anymore as that was already the end-line.

In total:

This game is shit. I'm not often saying this about a game, I usually point out the flaws to mention how something can be made better.... but this one? This had everything to be good... but nothing was finished.
It's simply one of the least worthwhile experiences on the gaming market, and for the still high price-tag of 70€ you're better off buying several trash-games which each offers 5 hours of fun for being trash then buying this 'AAA' game that shoves being beyond mediocre into your face from the start.

You hope it gets more after you start? No, it never does. The first 3 hours is what the whole game is, there is nothing more, you've seen all it has to offer, all other stuff is added on is solely the same thing in another package or side-mechanics which are unfinished.
This type of game-design should be considered a scam actually... sadly it is not.

In the beginning I played Space Invaders in the arcade. Years later I played Elite on a BBC B home computer in 1984.

Space. If it’s so big why are there griefers, pirates, killer aliens and loading screens everywhere?

Freelancer. Eve Online. Many versions of Elite. No Man’s Sky. FTL. Stellaris. X4. Space Rangers.

[b]To infinity and beyond[/b]

There’s no perfect Space game. They all have something missing. Something I would add.
Starfield might be the closest to my ideals, my needs. My desire to do whatever I want.

Let’s check some of the requirements/ attributes on the list:
[list]
[*]A universe to explore with an interesting back story, space, systems and planets
[*]Ships to buy or construct yourself. Hull, shields, fuel, cargo space, habitat modules, colour schemes
[*]Guns, armour, helmets, aid, lockpicking. Booster packs. Zero gravity spaces.
[*]Piracy, Bounty Hunting, Missions, Aliens, Landing on Planets
[*]Character Development, skills, relationships. Oxygen consumption.
[*]Shooter, looter, research, your own home base of ops
[*]Base building, home purchasing, companions, romance, parents, adoring fan
[/list]

[b]Bethesda[/b]
The first Beth game I played was called Gridiron back in 1986. 
However, they grabbed my soul through Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind etc. 
It’s the freedom. The first-person perspective. To go wherever I want and do whatever I wanted. 
Starfield continues that path. 

***************
I land my ship on a huge platform in the middle of an ocean. It’s called Neon City. 
I cross the long bridge and enter the city. Talk to some people. Go through this door, climb some stairs. Left and right. Continue my mission. I look over the platform, the edge, and see my bloody ship far below. I swear I can jump down to it.
***************

[b]The Community[/b]
As with these games since MW, the players make the game better or help you play the way you want. Most developers don’t do this. In Oblivion I made a simple mod that made hand to hand combat more viable.

My fav mods in Starfield now:
a) one that allows you to register ships very cheaply so that piracy and selling ships becomes a real option
b) one that helps you locate a base building location with added materials and a guide

You want more guns, more ships, harder combat, more missions, instant character creation…

[b]To Infinity and Beyond[/b]

One of the problems with Oblivion, Skyrim etc is that there is a lot of content. You won’t see it all. But you can forge your path. For me, it’s hardly ever the main path.

575 hours into Starfield now I am appreciating it more. I notice things I never did before. I think the planets in systems move.

[b]Frustrations[/b]

Beth have fixed some of the probs such as loading screens and provided vehicles to promote travelling on planets. They have provided maps to prompt faster travelling within cities. 

Something is missing though. A reason to explore. 

In Fallout 4, Oblivion and Skyrim you knew if you headed out in a direction something will find you. Is that true in Starfield?

I would suggest something like F4 outpost development and building. The settlements. A storyline encouraging you to build and connect communities.

I would also add a proper trading system where merchant roleplaying/ mining was an option.

[b]Summary[/b]

Starfield is nearly there. Just a few more light years. Just one more system to jump into.

I don’t believe ship building was intended to be in the final game but someone high up must of realised the game was looking terrible and they added it in.

The universe feels vast, you get a cool spaceship that makes spaceship noises and the story seems interesting enough. After the initial discovery and wonder the game quickly becomes very bland and boring. 

For me, the crafting mechanism is useless and so overcomplicated that it's just not worth doing. Because of this inventory management boils down to constantly filtering out useless trash to avoid becoming overencumbered. 

The different weapon types, despite some nifty laser 'pew pew' effects don't really make that much difference or feel that exciting to use. 

It feels very much like they added stuff for the sake of having a lot of stuff rather than focusing on having a diverse amount of good stuff that impacts playstyle and gameplay options. The same goes for the sidemissions and the planets in general. 

Even the choises you make are basicly not that important; yes one person will give you more cash and the other one will throw in a fancy hat, whoopty doo. 

I just didn't care about what I was doing or why anymore and just felt like I was going through the motions playing the game more out of boredom rather than actual interest. Kinda like watching some dumb realty tv show on the tv while actually browsing my phone. As soon as you turn it of, you really don't remember what you actually did. Utterly forgettable. 

So in conclusion: In an age with new games coming out dayly, fighting for your precious and limited time on this planet, this one should not be concidered. This game would the oatmeal of games, if it had nutritional value. Maybe dlc can add something interesting down the line but with the writing team that made the main game, I wouldn't hold my breath.",False,325,3155
Starfield,1716740,203935933,"what I love the most about this game, is being able to have your own literal House in Space.
+ full customization (the design and look of your spaceship) + inside of your ship (add furniture + workshop modules, etc)
it scratches everything that I want from SPACE SIM. cinematic take off and landing.
+ you can stand up from cockpit and walk around inside your spaceship.
+ you can role play as a space trucker - to make money as a hauler, or..
++ you can board and hi-jack other ships - steal it, keep it or sell it.  
+++ have to edit - I forgot to add that you can also create your own outpost on any Planet !! - you can build and design to your hearts content and have your companions live with you.

I will be happy if this is the only thing you can do in game, but ... 

you also have Quest Line of Main Story - you can ignore it or do it, lots of different faction you can join with countless of hours to sink into. its amazing.  sure this game may have added some controversial stuff, but just like in real life..

Starfield,1716740,203906638,"I've been gaming since Wolf3D and overall give Starfield a 7 out of 10.      I feel this game gets so much hate because of a lack of perspective.....

While I do agree with many that it was a mistake for them to use the same engine that was used to make Skyrim, however, players need to compare a fresh install of Skyrim vs Starfield.       It is stupid amazing how much they were able to push such a outdated engine....

Much of the hate towards this game comes from the loading screens.     I truly don't understand this complaint.     First, if your playing on a laptop, that's on you.   I don't care if it's a ""gaming"" laptop.   Second, I don't recall to much fuse over Skyrim and loading screens for Cities, Caves, Houses, Ect....    FarCry had a few loading screens, Half-Life had out of nowhere mid map loading screens..      

So why is this a issue for Starfield?    Because it's a bigger game.     The loading screens are a necessary evil for several reasons, one being to make sure as many computers can run the game and to make sure your computer doesn't exploded from trying to load huge amounts of data\textures.        Don't get me wrong, I do think they could remove some of them.

All the plants are boring?    Keep in mind that Bethesda wanted to be as real as possible.....    Every planet in our own Solar System, is nothing but a barren boring rock.   Also, based of the time frame of  game events, the settled systems don't have enough people total to fill every planet, so of course there aren't many points of interest to explore on every planet.

Yes the combat is a bit lacking but this game's main purpose is not a action game but role playing game.   As the player you got to put yourself in the shoes of the miner your playing.   Don't rush the main story, explore the side quests, even ones that don't seem important in anyway.   Almost all of them are connected to the main story in one way or another.

Overall I believe the main reason why it seems this game is dead is actually because of the modders.    

Everyone knows Bethesda games are made with the expectations that the modding community will step in and keep things going with a steady flood of improvements.     Unfortunately due to various reasons that caused a bad reception upon release day.    Many modders have turned away from the game which is a bit sad because after you install a few good known must have mods, you quickly see how this game could only get better. 

To counter some of the bad reviews for this game..     Mods can solve the following issues, UI, shipbuilding, player exp curve per level, combat damage numbers, remove the mind numbing temple puzzle that has to be done way to much, all game stats, common game bugs, NG+ improvements.....

Starfield is no different to me even while I do believe Bethesda bit off more than they can chew with this ambitious title it's clear to me a lot of thought and effort was put into it. 

Starfield is by no means perfect, there are some elements, big and small from their previous titles that are not present, yet there a lot of aspects improved (specifically many of the roleplay criticisms from Fallout 4). And there gameplay features unique to it that could have been handled better (primarily space travel and planet exploration). I will admit that despite my enjoyment of this game. However, despite those issues, there is a lot this game does offer that makes it's worthwhile and even unique.

There is a plethora of things I could say about this game. I put many many hours into it across three different characters, yet I only finished the main quest with one, one character built for a completionist playthrough and I have say I was very fulfilled, taken back and honestly swept with a lot of emotion with the journey this game will take you on if you just give a shot, take your time and use a bit of your imagination.

Bethesda style RPG in space? Completing sci-fi quests while flying through space, travelling the unknown in the name of science and exploring the cosmos? Customizing spaceships and managing a crew? Shooting bad guys? Awesome.

I really wanted this game to be Fallout in space, so bad. And I think that helped ruin my experience because this is nothing like those games. It would seem stupid to compare this game with the 10+ year old Fallout 4, but it's not even fair for starfield to compete against it. And fallout 4 isn't even that good. I would love to compare starfield to FNV which is even older and better than FO4 but that game was not made by Bethesda.

Anyways, after 5 hours of gameplay here are my thoughts. I have formatted this review in sections to talk about the parts of the game I was most excited for, and how I was completely let down in every way possible.

[h3] Space Travel: Nonexistent. [/h3]

Piloting/flying the spaceship through space is useless, unrewarding and not engaging whatsoever. Honestly completely useless. I would have honestly preferred no spaceships/flying whatsoever compared to the joke of an experience you get playing starfield.

The way you travel between galaxies/star systems is via this annoying menu with multiple layers, where you pick a star system and then choose a planet in the star system, then press x and you are magically teleported into orbit there. Once you arrive in orbit you have to go BACK into the same menu, click on the planet AGAIN, and press x to land there. Sometimes when you arrive in orbit there will be a random event where you might have to fly around a little to engage in combat with another spaceship. This is the most opportunity you will get in terms of being able to fly the spaceship around.

[h3] Story/characters: Boring. [/h3]

Doesn't matter what class of character or what background you choose for yourself, your story always begins in the same place under the same circumstances. The premise of the story is that you have to find these pieces of metal that have zero connection to you. You just happened to be in the right place at the right time to find a piece of metal and now have to go on 1000 identical boring fetch-quests to get more. There is no personal connection for the story to kickstart your emotional investment or any real reason to be doing what you are doing in the game. The characters aren't written very well and the voice acting is passable but not stellar. You can tell voice lines were all recording separately with little to no direction because conversations between NPC's have these odd exchanges where they sound they are reading lines instead of reacting to the other character's statements. That kills any sort of immersion in the game.

Basically the entire game in a nutshell: Use the menu to travel to a nearby star system, use the menu to choose a planet, use the menu to land. watch a cutscene to land. Get out of the ship, shoot a couple of guys, collect your little metal shard at the end of a cave, then use a menu to fast travel back to your ship. Use another menu to take off, watch a cutscene, and travel back to your little base, use the menu again to land, and deliver your metal shard and engage in boring conversation with boring characters about stuff that doesn't concern you in any way. Do this about 100 times and you have completed the game. Wow.

[h3] Pros? Not enough [/h3]

Graphics are nice enough and the game appears to be well optimized. I don't have stuttering or framerate issues which is a very nice change to my typical bethesda experience. Gunplay is good enough. Lots of variety in weapons and customizations. I would want to mention the spaceship building/customization here but you never really get to use the thing, so what is the point of customizing it?

[h3] Digster's rating? [/h3] 

5/10.

If you really want to try it, buy it on sale. At least 50% off, preferably more. Not worth the AAA price tag.

Starfield,1716740,203582157,"Don't get me wrong it is a good game, but...

Bethesda, for me, will never reach the peak that was Morrowind, where at the start, your only connection is Jiub and they immediately drop you off at the docks alone. Suggesting that you explore the beautiful world they spent designing, on your own schedule. With no obligation or scripted ties to anyone. Even if you follow its main quest, they still push you multiple times to go your own way, see the world, and become apart of it.

Starfield, again for me, is too heavy handed without doing anything truly unique apart from telling an okay story with a fetch mechanic based progression similar to skyrim in a highly detailed environment with fancy materials based off a modded version of fallout. 

Big negative for me was the fact that it was also plagued with mass real time procedural generation (which sucks a continuity of life from a world making everything seem arbitrary) with very little options in terms of making a unique part of space your own. 

Despite 23 years since that 3D open world formula was established it was somehow lost to time by the people who established it with a game of the year award.

This game, however, felt like the player was only there for the developers ride. Not good.

Locking a lot of content behind what i personally would describe as: the worlds longest intro quest (Im still not sure if i unlocked everything) i feel intentionally discards the charm with something being open world. When you constrain the player to these narrow metaphorical hallways, especially when they are littered with npcs randomly handing you the equivalent of a leaflet just for walking in proximity of them, it robs you of the experience and ultimately frustrates people. Like trader opening dialogue one shots when you're only goal was to quickly sell items and move onto the next thing.

The ship design and actual piloting of your ship is a wonderful addition sitting next to older games that built out the foundations this game sits on, but i feel its incomplete without a complimenting fully fleshed outpost building system. The signs of what made the budget is clearest here and it was not the bells and whistles for base modules. It feels weirdly taunting to have to raid places you know you'll never be able to build because of that restriction. I could see it being a point of contention to hate the game for some.

Another point of contention (some might have) is with the character creator, the constant moving of the characters head and face during editing makes me wish this trend would die, it makes it impossible to view the edges of the face and is a constant source of frustration especially when you're limited to editing with  2-3 sliders that change poorly described regions of the face.

A minor gripe with animations, which I'm sure on controller this game handles just fine in 3rd person, on mouse and keyboard your character is ice skating if you move the mouse while moving. Not to mention the entire bone chain for the  middle torso to lower abdominal region is nearly static when turning and has little to no movement, until you strafe. It looks great on npc's but when your character is the main focus of the screen in 3rd person its hard not to notice. 

After all these complaints I'm sure whoever reads this far is wondering if there is anything i liked anything about the game.

Bethesda is a money hungry shit company.  would love to support their developers but for some reason I feel like they also play a huge role in why this game is horseshit and why bethesda has gone off the deep end into a dive into the abyss.

Starfield,1716740,203485159,"With nearly 500 hours invested, I'm still finding myself genuinely surprised by the sheer amount of detail and effort that was put into this game.

I've never quite understood the harsh criticism the game has received. Since its release, it seems to have been met with mostly negative feedback, with some claiming it's ""empty"" or ""lacks charm"". From my experience, nothing could be further from the truth. Perhaps it's just me-or maybe expectations have shifted in a world where people want constant updates to stay entertained-but this game delivers in ways that truly matter.

Bethesda has given us the deep, emotionally grounded storytelling we loved in Fallout: New Vegas, 4 & 3. Combined with the intriguing POI reminiscent of Skyrim and other Elder Scrolls titles. Locations aren't just scenery; they tell stories without having to shout them, and the staggering attention to detail is what truly sets the game apart.

Starfield may not be everyone's cup of tea, and that's okay. But for me, it's exactly what I've always wanted from a Bethesda experience-(Bugs and all)-a game that rewards exploration, immersion, and curiosity at every turn.

I'm also excited to see what the modding community will continue to bring. Bethesda games always shine when fans get creative. Future updates and DLCs have the potential to make Starfield even richer, and i Can't wait to see the universe expand in ways we haven't even imagined yet.

They have added enough to the game that I feel it has improved, and maybe I'm a clown for thinking that, but Idk honk honk I guess.

The gameplay settings are pretty god dang expansive in a way that I love, meaning you can crank up and down a bunch of settings to match your preferred playstyle. For me, I made my damage and enemy damage SUPER high, and cranked up the medical conditions severity, so combat feels very like... tarkov-like. (Not exactly but you know what I mean) 

With my settings, if you get the drop on a group of spacers you can take them all out with a few well placed headshots, HOWEVER, if someone gets the drop on me, I'm screwed. Which is kinda fun, makes guns feel more lethal.

Anyways thats just one setting, there are a ton to tailor the general gameplay. There are also a lot of QOL things added, as well as just missing features that have been patched in:
- Area maps
- buggy-type vehicle for planet exploration
- can fast travel out of many locations you couldnt normally
- Area maps
- Ability to target mission locations in your ship hud to fast travel there instead of going to the menu (Not a fix to the fast travel issue, but SLIGHTLY more immersive I guess? idk)
- AREA MAPS

The ship building game loop of:

The NASA Punk aesthetic. Some people didn't like I but I'm a fan of the UI style.


The Meh

Gunplay is okay, I guess. The gun upgrading systems didn't grab me like Oblivion or Skyrim did.


The Bad

- I had some major side quest get derailed by a merchant NPC spawning somewhere far away in the sky, instead of in his shop.
- So many characters are unkillable, despite the story being very very amenable to having all characters be expendable. This makes the stakes feel lower and lamer for no reason.
- ""Open World"" but linear af main quest. The era of linear story lines or even branching story lines in video games needs to die. If I want to experience one I'll read a book or watch a movie. We can do better. Give me Dwarf Fortress world generation and history simulation with dynamic dialogue, organic factions, and conflicts that arise from the opposing goals and incentives of those factions and NPCs.

Starfield,1716740,203372194,"Starfield is so close yet so far from being the perfect Space RPG. No Man's Sky is rooted all throughout this game, which is great. NMS is still king in the Space genre, however NMS is way more about exploration than anything else. I have always wanted a more realistic take on NMS that has much more depth in its combat, both on foot and in your ship. Starfield is sort of an answer to this, but its lacking so much in other areas that it really keeps this game from being as amazing as it really could be. Engine limitations have hindered the space experience, there is no traveling in space, no flying between planets, no flying into a planet's atmosphere and landing wherever you want. A lot of this really does impact the overall experience and it makes me incredibly sad because there is a lot here that I like.

Which is why I am recommending it. A lot of people may disagree here, which is fine, but this is just how I feel and maybe some of you trying to decide whether to get the game will feel. The aspects here that are good, are great - for the most part - this is the first Bethesda game that feels good and smooth, not that much jank, gunplay is their best yet (which isn't saying much). I really love the aesthetic they got going here, the cities feel unique and very fantasy-like but in the context of sci-fi. The worlds do look beautiful, you'll find a lot of screenshot worthy planets. The gameplay loop is fun for a bit, but it does get repetitive rather quickly, however it doesn't change the fact that it is still addicting. Theres always more things to get or upgrade, or add to your arsenal. I do wish there was more human enemy types however. Its crazy how Halo Combat Evolved, a 20+ year old game still has some of the best enemy variety and AI to this day, and no one seems to take notes. 

Anyways, if you're looking to try out a realistic take on NMS, set in a Bethesda RPG world, with all the good and bad that comes with that, give this a shot. Thankfully, this isn't really a game that NEEDS mods, in fact there really isn't much mod support for the game since it died off pretty quickly. But don't let the hate pull you away from a game that you'll probably enjoy. But definitely get it on sale, $70 for ANY game is way too much.

+ building character
+ exploring new places (until the are not new anymore, you know, copy/pasted)
+ killing enemies and hoarding loot to sell it
+ having crew and all this mass-effect-like romantic vibes
+ main story is _not_bad_

I really enjoy roaming on the planet: killing fauna, gathering resources (no idea what for), reaching PoI, exploring PoE, finding magazines... could do this for hours and I did it for many hours.. it's fun.

What I dislike:

- everything else.

A detailed list:

- leveling is too slow paces, quest rewards are pathetic, constant lack of skill points;
- space combat is a big, stupid, and not fun mess
- ship require too many skill points otherwise any encounter is a stress
- ship builder is ugly, messy ship components scattered over the galaxy or needed to be unlocked, poor UI
- non-rewarding ship-capturing mechanic. their sell price is pathetic, on-ship loot/combat is pathetic
- poor quests, all of them, running from one point to another, talking, sneaking, sometimes fighting.. booooring
- NPC models are very similar, I think I've seen 10 brothers of that police officer from New Atlantis
- the map is annoying, even after 200 hours I hit esc to close it and instead it switches to a higher level map ><
- lack of QoL EVERYWHERE, from inventory, where I can't just drink/eat something, but need to go through huge non-filterable list to a map, where you can't just visit city, no, you need to remember all systems, planets, stations and manually navigate
- lots of bugs, small bugs, big bugs, 2 years-lasting bugs, I am sure there will be lots of 10-years lasting bugs too
- inventory management is really annoying after a while, no way to prevent accidental move/sell, lots of garbage, it's very poor inventory, from UI to automating common operations
- VERY stupid research and craft system, locked behind obtaining skill, which can be obtained by crafting and spending previous skill points, you got it
- there are numerous of powers in game, yet no way to use more than few of them comfortable, nor a way to track which one is active.. how many times I used the wrong power? How many times I had to click 5 buttons to just use rarely used power???
- the power system is very repeatable, poorly rewarding and way too farmy for maxing (hell, you need to collect powers, playing that stupid catch spark mini-game 240 times over the course of 10 full galaxy resets!), most of us going to play this freeking game once at most, many don't even finish it, not sure where Bethesda find their naive game designers
- quests: too many dialogues overall and too little action
- slow nonskipable animation, opening air-locked door, sitting/standing up, clicking NPC and waiting until it turn/stands up/whatever, following NPC in MANY quests
-the universe is full of garbage, most of pickable items you don't ever need, WHY making them pickable/show them in scanner?
- scanner (your the only tool to highlight items in this ""gray""-pallette universe, where everything is dim and hard to see) is buggy, doesn't highlight all items, many actions are disable while scanner is active, I hate it, but there is no other way. I wish Bethesda devs play Borderlands games once
- environmental protection get SO MUCH annoying very quickly, no way to recharge it, in several quests it breaks all the immersion by beeping, dealing damage, causing debuffs
- poor DLC on top 

.. I could continue for much longer telling BAD things about this game. Basically on any good thing comes in package with 9 bad ones. UI is bad and lacking, QoL is non existent (the only good thing, thanks god, is an ability to press button in quest log to instantly show destination on the map, without it game would be a total nightmare).

Overall, it’s a AAA game that started off with big ambitions, but then they began cutting pieces out, and a lot of unfinished, poorly polished stuff was left by the time release came around. Dialogues with two different voices, conflicting UI elements, weird controls. It could’ve been a good game with another 10 years of development. As it is, it turned out to be something confusing, strange mixture of Mass Effect, No Man's Sky (or similar), Fallout. Now I just want to finish the achievements and forget it like a bad dream.

Starfield,1716740,203327086,"[h1]A Bethesda Game in Space[/h1]
Look, this is a Bethesda game in space. If you're familiar with the formula of games like [b]Fallout[/b] or [b]Skyrim[/b], [b]Starfield[/b] will not come as a surprise. The result, in the context of a massive sci-fi universe, is exactly what should have been expected. And honestly, I think a lot of the criticism it received was unfair.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Best and Worst of the Sandbox[/h2]
This is a game best played when you slow it down, but the game itself can make that hard. It can feel a bit overwhelming, and you might easily get confused by the sheer number of quests available. It's hard to know what's a unique, hand-crafted experience and what is just a repeatable chore. The mission boards, constant radiant quests, and the act of just surveying a planet all blur together. If you get caught up in doing only those things, you will get bored quickly and miss the real strengths of the game.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Where It Truly Shines[/h2]
However, the game truly shines in its rich, immersive side quests and the smooth first-person shooting. The beautiful aesthetics and overall theme are fantastic, and if you're willing to be a deliberate explorer and seek out those quests, you'll find incredible stories that feel both personal and rewarding. This is where the game's open sandbox design truly pays off. [b]Starfield[/b] becomes what you make of it—an intimate journey or a simple life as a scavenger.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Honest Truth About its Faults[/h2]
The game isn't perfect, of course. The main story, particularly the concept of the Starborn, is quite weak and feels unattached from the rest of the game. Many of the main characters are poorly written or just straight-up dull, making it hard to care about them. The simple act of helping a random NPC in a side quest can often lead to a much more meaningful interaction and story. I also understand the frustration with loading screens, especially when compared to other sci-fi games. They can become frequent, but they are still very short (only 2-3 seconds) and something you come to expect from a Bethesda title.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]The Final Verdict[/h2]
For those of you wondering, this is how I play games. I’m someone who loves immersion and roleplaying. I get rid of most of the UI and don't chase the meta build or the best gear. With that in mind, I also believe that mods shouldn't justify if a game is good or not, but they have become a standard part of the [b]Bethesda[/b] experience. They can make the game feel more grounded and give you control over your own play experience.

The core of a great [b]Bethesda[/b] game is here: beautiful design, immersive first-person gameplay, and a huge sandbox. I don't care about a company's reputation or what people say online; at the end of the day, I care about what's in front of me and how it feels to play. If you want a similar feel to previous [b]Bethesda[/b] titles, I would recommend giving it a chance.",True,2,7720

you don't need mods / creations to have fun 
it just makes it better
and that there achievement friendly ( for a small amount of money which is a bit of a gut punch but alright ) 
So max Difficulty, Creation everyone on Board
6 Companions 
awesome massive gun fights 

just sad that the Star Wars mods / Creations block achievements but maybe i will do a full SW play through after i got all / most that i want

The outpost system is entirely optional and basically useless. You spend dozens upon dozens of hours building a complex trade and manufacturing network across the galaxy, and then you NG+ and it's all been entirely wasted with nothing to show for it.
The companions are somehow more annoying than previous Bethesda games. Constantly standing in doorways(which is particularly annoying in the tight, confined areas of ships/stations), companions feeling useless in combat, being extremely picky and judgmental about every decision you make(look at you, Sarah Morgan. Being upset that I stole from pirates because the object was marked as stealing), and just overall being unfun to travel with.
The ship customization also feels like a major afterthought. Like it was thrown together when they realized the game had no redeeming qualities and thought that maybe customizable ships would help.

my main criticism with the game is that it feels kinda empty both in terms of the world itself and the characters that you meet. in comparison to other bethesda games i've spent large chunks of my life playing (cough cough skyrim), i didn't find myself excited to explore all of the different structures on all of the planets in hopes that i'd find a unique quest or layout to explore. i didn't really find myself overly attached to many of the characters that i met throughout my journey because they felt so empty and almost one note? i did find that i didn't really want to have any of the constellation members as a part of my crew because they would get angry with you if you did anything that they didnt agree with (theft, crime etc etc). you would think that the main characters having morals would make them more impactful or human, but because all of them felt the same way, it just felt more frustrating than anything if i wanted to roleplay as a morally grey character. i don't think that they were bad characters by any means, but that in combination with how flat a lot of other characters in the world felt made it feel less important to really talk to anyone or connect with them. 

i do really enjoy the game as it is and i appreciate the work that they've put into it because it really is just a stunning game and getting to explore space is SO COOL!!! it was probably my favourite part, especially when there would be the odd random event that made the galaxy feel more full of life. i think that i just wish that they didn't put so much effort into making the game as massive as it is only to leave it feeling kinda empty as a result. i would definitely recommend the game if you're a fan of exploration or seeing all of the different planets but if you find that a little tedious i would probably get this on sale or smth!",True,0,9163

The UI is the worst I have ever encountered. Everything is a nested menu. Everything is button inputs instead of mouse clicking. No page has a reasonable quantity of information. Sorting functions literally do not work sometimes and you have to close and reopen inventory to use them. Storage containers do not function properly?

I would literally nuke all console manufacturers IRL if it meant games would stop with these FUCKING TRASH ASS MENU SYSTEMS.

And then there is the gameplay. It's mediocre gunplay. Mediocre movement. Bad navigation. More minecraft/survival game resource collection garbage.

Also the load screens. You have to fast travel (load) your ship, get into your ship (load), open the trash ass navigation map to travel to a new system (load), get scanned then land (load), use a train to get to the right part of the city (load), go in a building (load) and at no point is there any meaningful gameplay in between these meaningless check boxes.

It's too bad I bought this ages ago and then didn't get it off my to do list until months later. Can't get a refund now.

Here are some thoughts. 

I spent 40 hours and the deeper I got into this one the worse it become.

Quest are just mediocre, I finished two factions and 50% into main quest and there were like 2-3 quests that peeked some interest.

Horrible face and body animations, it's like they are 20 years old. Just compare it to animations in Death Stranding, RDR2 or Last of us 2. 

Horrible menu, you need to click 3-5 times to set a quest marker or fasttravel from one planet to another.

In a 2023 game you holster your guns out of nowhere.

Outpost and planets surveing are just useless garbage, I dunno if anyone even bothered doing it.

Main quest isn't as interesting as I would've liked but I do like how new game + fits into the story even if the story largely remains the same.

Id say the ship customization is fun, and extremely detailed, but whats the fun of building a ship if you cant fly anywhere after?

Even after playing the dlc, it had some interesting moments but it really is a bit too pricey for what we're getting. 

Combat is whatever, not too much variety when it comes to weapons. Felt like a step down from fallout 4.

Starfield,1716740,202852432,"Exploring the Final Frontier: Starfield and the Art of Modding

Bethesda’s Starfield is an ambitious space-faring RPG that invites players to explore a vast galaxy, teeming with diverse planets, alien landscapes, and fascinating characters. As the studio’s first new IP in over two decades, it has captured the imagination of gamers eager to chart the stars and create their own stories among the stars.

A Universe Waiting to Be Explored

One of Starfield’s most striking features is its scale. Players can traverse hundreds of procedurally generated planets, each with unique terrain, climates, and resources. From arid desert worlds dotted with ancient ruins to icy planets with hidden subterranean oceans, the game delivers a rich sense of exploration. The freedom to land on virtually any planet, pilot customizable ships, and investigate uncharted locations gives players the feeling of genuine interstellar discovery.

Every planet hosts unique environmental challenges, resource opportunities, and potential encounters. Whether scavenging for valuable minerals, deciphering alien technologies, or interacting with local factions, exploration is both rewarding and immersive. The game’s attention to detail extends to its day-night cycles, atmospheric conditions, and dynamic ecosystems, making each world feel alive and distinct.

Characters That Shape Your Journey

The galaxy of Starfield is populated by a diverse cast of characters, from hardened space mercenaries to enigmatic scientists and traders. NPCs have their own motives, affiliations, and storylines, which can influence the player’s journey. Choosing alliances, navigating moral dilemmas, and engaging in dialogue choices all impact the narrative, offering multiple ways to experience the story.

Companions further enrich gameplay, providing unique skills, backstories, and sometimes comic relief. Whether forming strong friendships, rivalries, or even romances, characters make the galaxy feel personal and lived-in.

Modding: Expanding the Universe

Modding has long been a hallmark of Bethesda games, and Starfield is no exception. The game’s robust creation tools allow players to craft entirely new experiences, from cosmetic tweaks to expansive gameplay additions. Mods can enhance graphics, introduce new ships and planets, or even add gameplay mechanics like multiplayer functionality—a popular aspiration among the modding community.

Some notable modding possibilities include:

Planet and Biome Expansion: Players can create entirely new planets with custom terrains, flora, and alien lifeforms, expanding the galaxy beyond what’s in the base game.

Character and Faction Mods: Custom NPCs, factions, or even companion modifications allow players to enrich interactions and story depth.

Quality-of-Life Improvements: Mods can streamline inventory management, UI, and navigation, enhancing immersion and convenience.

Gameplay Mechanics: Advanced mods can introduce features like faster travel systems, enhanced combat mechanics, or entirely new mission types.

The modding community thrives on collaboration, sharing creations that continuously refresh the game for both veterans and newcomers. For those willing to dive into coding or asset creation, modding provides a creative outlet that can turn Starfield into a personalized universe.

Conclusion

Starfield combines the thrill of space exploration with rich storytelling, offering a galaxy filled with planets to discover and characters to meet. Its modding potential adds a layer of limitless creativity, allowing players not only to explore the stars but to reshape the universe itself. Whether you’re charting unknown worlds or creating new adventures through mods, Starfield invites you to make the cosmos your own.",True,0,65277
Starfield,1716740,202850514,"The game is o.k. for what it is.  It's not trash, but then again it's not amazing either.  The thumbs down is because I couldn't recommend people buy the game without checking out both the positive and negative reviews of the game first.  Then decide for themselves whether or not they want to spend the money and give this game a spin.

I will say this it's not in the same league as Baldur's Gate 3, Witcher 3 or Kingdom Come Deliverance...not even close.  In fact I think Bethesda did a better job with Skyrim and Fallout. 

The stories in Starfield are somewhat interesting, but one of the things I look for in a game is replayability.  Right not it's it's kind of looking like a one-and-done kind of game to me.  As far as the NG+ feature...I heard someone say the juice ain't worth the squeeze, and I'm inclined to agree.  

As far as the spaceship dogfights go, well I come from an extensive EvE Online background.  So, what can I say.

UPDATE:  After spending more hours with this game,  I've changed my opinion somewhat.  I would recommend this game to those who might like this sort of game.  There's plenty to explore and do.  There are bugs and because of random times where the game freezes and locks up, you need to save often in order not to lose too much progress.  That typical with Bethesda games where they don't put enough effort into quality control and bug fixing.

I've enjoyed playing around with the ship building and outpost building features.  There are lots of interesting side quests to keep you busy,  and there is some amount of re-playability and build variety to the extent that I can say I've gotten my money's worth out of this game and I'll probably be spending more hours with the game.

FINAL COMMENTS
After 311 hours I've uninstalled the game.  Do I feel I got my money's worth.  Sure.  Was I impressed.  Not really.  The ship building and outpost building was more engaging than the main story.  Heck, some of the side quests were more engaging than the main story.  The only value companions brought to the game was their buffs as crew members on the ship, even that aspect was short lived.  I found it much more enjoyable to just travel alone without the same chatter repeating over and over.  Plus as companions, they contribute little and often get in the way.  

I didn't like that quests were automatically put into your quest list without giving you a choice.  At minimum it would have been nice to have a separate inactive quest tab that you could move them to.  This would eliminate a lot of clutter in your active quest tab.  

The ship combat was not impressive.  No skill required.  Just bump up the perk points, beef up your weapons and shield and you're golden.  But here I'm comparing the ship combat with EvE Online.  So that's probably not a fair comparison.

There really is not as much replayability as it might seem at first.  You can do almost everything with just one character regardless of the background or traits you chose.  Although it would have been nice if there was some sort of path to redemption for the player if they rejected SysDef's offer and sided with the Crimson Fleet where they had the ability to choose between SysDef and the Crimson Fleet after retrieving the legacy.

Will I play this game again?  If I do, it probably won't be for a long while.",True,0,18687
Starfield,1716740,202839355,"Unfortunately ia cannot recommend Starfield.
Its a classic Bethesda game, but this is more negative than positive at this point. 
1. The graphics are decent, nothing ground breaking but nothing bud either. This is pretty much the only positive tha Starfield has.
2. The main story is basic Skyrim -like story, instead of Dragonborn you have Starborn. The side quest are basic fetch queat with no depth at all. The Factions are pretty basic to , they are just reskined functions to fit the space theme. Simple this kind of storytelling is from 2010 , there are multiple games that did it better and in 2025 it's just outdated.
3. The dlc is just as shallow as the side quests and the charge 20+ Euros for it.
4. Gameplay: This has to be the most outdated aspect of Bethesda games. In a world tha RD2 , Witcher 3 , KCD 2 , Baldurs Gates 3 exists games like Starfield have no place. Teams of 50 developers create better games tha 600 developers. I believe all Bethesda wants is to produce games with the list effort: same mechanics , AI  generated maps and quest and just print money.

 The story was interesting, new game plus was meh, (most people rushed to new game +10, said the game sucked and review bombed then dipped, so kinda didn't even really play it)  especially since Shattered space has no effect or special ending like the rest of the factions or alternate universes. 

You kinda feel forced to be good unfortunately, unless you take no companions with you, the visuals are beautiful along with the envrioments, I prefer it to that disaster of an engine unreal 5. Gameplay is just classic Bethesda really, love it or hate it. It could be a much much better game and sure it's lack luster compared to some of their other games especially in the exploring department, but it has a good story, mostly interesting side quests, interesting characters if you pay attention enough and it's a fun Bethesda shooter. It needs work, but it's good.

 I sincerely hope it improves I've been a long time Bethesda fan, hate to see this game given up on. I know they can make it truly great, if they just bring back some of that original formula and charm for exploration, quests, companions, and world design and environmental story telling.

Starfield,1716740,202668228,"The game is as empty as people say. I struggled to find a reason to continue playing. I am now testing some mods again to see if it improves. I installed the mod collection Gate to Stars from nexusmods and it truly improves almost every aspect of the game. But vanilla Starfield still is not the game it was said to be prior to release.

The game is basically space fallout but with a less interesting story and even less interesting characters. The world building is not good. I have seen some reviewers, even critical reviewers, claim the world building is good. It is not. This is supposed to be a large part of the galaxy that has been explored, inhabited, for something like a couple hundred years. It amounts to 2,000 empty planets. 

Even the planets that have what should be large populations, major cities, are tiny insignificant and bland locales. The game is not a space exploration game. The planets have nothing of interest besides resources you need to gather that are never in one planet so youll be planet hopping across systems just to go through the tedious process of upgrading one of the many terrible weapons.

It is a fast travel and loading screen simulator. Often times when i play an MMO or multiplayer RPG game, i think ""i wish this were a single player game"". But with this game its the opposite. this would be a fantastic multiplayer game. But that is one of the many things Bethesda has been on record of definitely not doing. Along with all of their other ""definite nos"" when creating this game and responding to the feedback. They seem to love disappointing people and making the game as poorly as possible.

But this is nothing new. A lot of people have talked about this. But I have given this game a lot of hours without paying attention to the critics because I wanted to get an idea of it on my own before really paying attention to the same complaints I had.

So the game is worse than the fallout games in story, environment, etc. But that doesnt mean it is absolute trash. It still was entertaining enough. I also dont agree with people who claim a game must have 150-1000 hours of gameplay to make it worth the 60 dollar price tag. If you play for 60 hours, thats 1 dollar per hour. Is that really not worth it? Even if it is a disappointing experience, you still spent 60 hours for some reason. I recognize that, and because of that I really cannot say I regret playing it. It had aspects that are really cool and fun. Just because something isnt as good as something else doesnt mean it is worthless. I love the movie Alien and Aliens, and find Alien 3, 4 etc to be awful compared but i still enjoy them and will watch them all together every so many years when I binge the series again. Even the Alien VS Predator movies find their way in and those are pretty bad movies.

But Bethesda should not be making the equivalent of B movies when making their games. Starfield is not 1:1 the equivalent of Alien Vs Predator when looking at things that came before... but it is not much better.

I love it now that the modders have made it brilliant. And I hate that Bethesda gets rewarded by the work of the modders (due to people buying their game, and playing it only due to modders making it worth playing). But thats why we need to support indie game creators more. They are truly making interesting content.

If you really dont care that Bethesda made a subpar game and lied about what they were making prior to release, then buy it and get mods and youll probably enjoy it a lot.

The actual world and universe itself is bland and not interesting. The main story of the game has a really unironically interesting concept for it's ending, but is ruined because the content it leads to repeating is boring, because the original content being repeated was boring.

Starfield,1716740,202620119,"This will probably be the most negative positive review I've given. That's because I did *genuinely have fun* during most of the 400-plus hours I have in game. However, its flaws are just so glaring that I can't blame anyone who passes it by, and you're not really missing anything if you do.

First, the good. The visuals and soundtrack are spot-on. The atmosphere Bethesda wanted, they hit. The NASA and Space Age inspirations are there, and they are a joy to behold. This is probably the best ""space-themed wallpaper maker"" game there is, more than No Man's Sky or even my beloved Elite Dangerous. It's also the most stable Bethesda game I've played. In all my time, yes, it's crashed, but I never had a vital quest or item bug kill gameplay. There's definitely some fun to be had your initial forays into exploration, starship and outpost building, combat, and learning the lore of the setting. And there are some individual quests that are quite satisfying to solve.

But the longer you spend with it, the more the nagging flaws start to become. Some of it is technical -- the inventory/merchant UI is atrocious, and I was about eight hours in before I was looking for a mod to clean it up. The leveling, perks, and skills wildly vary in their applicability (and even clarity of what they do) relative to their cost. The starship combat tries to be engaging and tactical, but like the on-foot combat, tends to be very spongy towards your opponents unless you have overwhelming gear (or rebalance them in the settings), which brings me to a more overall point about what the game tries to be and what it actually is.

This isn't Skyrim in space, it's Borderlands wearing a thin skin of Original Series Star Trek. The fountain of arms and armor you're showered with and constantly expected to upgrade, the emphasis on gunfights versus any other gameplay, the fact that starships are basically glorified storage containers and loading screens, the lack of options and roleplaying to solve most quests, and the plot being a very loose excuse for it all is not really what I expected. There's such a lack of care for the setting Bethesda claims to have been building for 25(!) years. 21st-century ruins have the same computer technology as the 24th. Identically titled points of interest on opposite sides of the game map are built *fully* identically, down to data logs and half-eaten sandwiches, with only the enemies and contents of loot chests changing (and those still in identical locations). Main NPCs have little characterization and interactivity, with little of consequence besides arbitrary relationship values. A bit later in the main plot, when ""temples"" become available for exploration, the so-called puzzles within quickly become obviously meaningless and unchallenging, and it was after completing only a handful of those that I was on the lookout for a mod to auto-complete them. And it commits one of the worst sins for what claims to be a roleplaying game, in that the railroading in certain quests (including the main-plot ones) is as blatant as could be.

In retrospect, it all seems like it's done in service of the New Game Plus mechanic, but then that gets undermined by the fact that basically nothing matters in this setting because so little ever changes during a run, and then so little even potentially changes from run to run, that I wonder why they even bothered with having an NG+ option. So much of the game content can be seen in one or two runs that subsequent ones serve little purpose but building up your special powers (which are mostly useless until you have increased them significantly over multiple games) and character levels to access more perks. Starfield could have provided you with the opportunity to really impact the game world, but it doesn't. It could give you vast differences between runs to make it worthwhile to see what is out there, but it doesn't.

Overall, Starfield is a game that feels remarkably unconfident. It promises the galaxy, and it is fun to indulge that promise for a while, but it stands for nothing in its writing or gameplay. It asks questions but is tediously shy to even speculate on answers. It tells you in no uncertain terms to go out and explore, but gives you nothing to find. There's actually hints that maybe the right choice is *not* to continue wandering, but to stop and enjoy where you are, which is not inherently a bad message, but it clashes with everything the game purports to be about. It wants to emulate the best of science fiction, but won't commit to any compelling moral or narrative arcs to do so.

Is it worth the price of a case of good beer? Maybe, if you're in the mood for it, but it might end up being the kind of beer you take to a party and leave for someone else with different taste.

Starfield,1716740,202611372,"TLDR: Starfield is Outer Worlds (rpg in space) pretending to be Star Citizen (space sim).
Let's go through the steps of planetary travel in each of the three games:
OW: Enter ship (loading screen), select destination (loading screen), exit ship (loading screen).
SC: Walk onto ship, sit down, fly up, fly to destination, fly down & land, stand up, walk out of ship (no loading screens throughout process).
SF: Enter ship (loading screen), sit down, take off (loading screen), select destination while flying in space (loading screen), select landing point while flying in space (loading screen), stand up, exit ship (loading screen). Note: Starfield includes fast travel, which reduces the aforementioned five loading screens to one or two.
You'll notice that the only notable gameplay difference between OW and SF is spaceflight, but the number of travel steps is closer to SC. SC has done the work to make a space sim, so each step is naturally part of the experience; OW includes only the steps necessary to facilitate multiple distant game worlds; SF has strung together the individual events of planetary travel to give the illusion of a space sim, without those steps being required by the overall process.

At the time, though, my PC had trouble running it, and I ultimately dropped it because of that. Over the years, I lost sight of it, until just recently when I had an itch to play again—not sure why exactly.

The gameplay is mindless to its core: fetch-quest main missions, a hodgepodge of side quests, and ""activities"" that NPCs randomly add to your quest log. The side content is ultimately a distraction from how empty and soulless the entire game is. The developers obviously put some effort into the main cities, but past that, the procedurally generated content is positively bland in every aspect.

This time around, I decided to only play the main story missions as I couldn't bear the brain-dead content. The story is somewhat interesting to an extent but falls flat. Plus, I couldn't even finish the story because it led to an unskippable ship combat battle with high-level enemies. The ship combat is truly atrocious in this game already, and a 50-level difference just makes it impossible. But I cannot fathom spending any extra time leveling up for that. So I'm stopping there.

What a waste of money and time this game was. You'd be better off playing The Outer Worlds (seriously, even better than this) for a space travel story, or No Man's Sky for space exploration instead. Those two games would fill in any shortcomings Starfield has.

Outposts are built to expand, link resources, and grow over time.
Ship building is a massive time investment, meant to evolve with your character.

Without a proper save file cleaner, the game slowly chokes itself with leftover data  ghost scripts, orphaned quests, broken references. Eventually your once-great save risks crashing, bloating, or stuttering until you’re told the only “solution” is to restart.
Restarting is fine in Skyrim or Fallout where each playthrough can feel fresh. But in Starfield? Restarting means deleting years of investment in outposts, ships, and character progression. That’s not replay value  that’s punishment for long-term players.

Starfield,1716740,202561875,"🚀 Starfield Review — The Best Space Sim Out… But It’s Lonely at the Top

If you’ve ever stared at the stars and thought,
“I want to go there,”
Starfield says,
“Cool. Pack your gear. Let’s go.”

And it delivers.

Starfield isn’t just a game — it’s a galaxy. A vast, handcrafted constellation of planets, secrets, factions, starships, and strange anomalies that suck you in and refuse to let go.

But after a few hundred hours of charting the stars solo, one truth becomes clear:

This game was built for multiplayer… it just doesn’t have it.

Yet.

🌌 What It Gets Right (And It Gets a LOT Right)

Ship customization that turns every cockpit into a home.

Planetary exploration that feels genuinely mysterious and rewarding.

Gunplay that’s smooth and weighty — finally, Bethesda nailed it.

Dialogue and storylines that actually pull you in (Crimson Fleet, anyone?).

And the soundtrack? Cinematic perfection.

This isn’t No Man’s Sky.
This isn’t Elite Dangerous.
This is something else entirely — a Bethesda RPG first, space sim second, and an ambitious love letter to science fiction.

You can mine, fight, romance, steal, build, upgrade, smuggle, and scan until your ship's cargo bay is full of rare elements and ethical gray areas.

It’s fun. It’s deep. It’s massive.

And it feels like a real space odyssey.

🤝 But It Needs One More Thing: Us

There’s a moment — after you’ve built your dream ship, colonized a few outposts, made questionable moral decisions, and collected alien artifacts — where you sit in your captain’s chair and realize…

“I wish my friends could see this.”

Starfield is begging for co-op.

Just a two-player system would change the entire experience:

Co-piloting missions.

Base-building with friends.

Dual-ship PvE raids.

Shared exploration logs.

A reason to revisit planets and stories together.

Imagine crewing your custom frigate with your real friends, watching one scan for anomalies while another takes the helm and a third jumps into a spacewalk. The potential is right there. It just hasn’t been unlocked.

🛰️ Still the Best Solo Space Sim in the Galaxy

Don’t get me wrong — even without multiplayer, this is the most complete, immersive single-player space sim on the market right now.

But that’s the thing:
It’s almost too big to experience alone.

Bethesda built a galaxy worth sharing.
Now we’re just hoping they let us.

Final Verdict:
🌠 9/10 — “A breathtaking solo voyage through the stars… now give us a crew.”

Starfield is majestic, ambitious, and incredibly polished for a game of this scale. It sets a new bar for what a space sim can feel like when storytelling, combat, and freedom collide.

But if it ever adds multiplayer?

Game over.
This becomes the definitive space experience — full stop.

In a few hours I made my copy into a STAR WARS game with KOTOR music-jedi skills, armor ships, quests and props, which Rocks.  But Out of the box ""as is"" - this is a deeply flawed product.  The 3d avatars are complex and pretty models, but animated horribly with overly expressive and clumsy facial animations for speech and emotion that put them on par with muppets.   The ""random"" dungeon encounters scattered about are actually the exact same pre-built 12 levels or so that are recycled like counter strike levels with weak and dumb bots as opponents.  Boring.   The actual missions - some are complex and invested designs, and some are stupid errands and busy work for XP.  A lot of the game mechanics here are broken as hell..  Pickpocketing/stealth and the like - all busted up.   Skills are also badly designed with Skyrim and Fallout 4 having better skill tech trees and crafting.   Space travel occurs everywhere - and its all just blank 'screen loading' fast travel that takes time.  The UI Sucks - worst i've ever seen acutally - slow and with hot key buttons recycled depending on what 'mode' you're in.  Example -Hot Key ""E"" Activates targeting while flying, or could lock on to an enemy, or look or make you get up and walk away from you ship controls leaving your ship with no pilot in the middle of combat.  The UI is super slow too - taking you out of combat. and you have to go through many pages of UI to be in the right mode to reuse a hot key.  ugh -So its up to you mod it till it don't suck so much.  Unfortunately the game is very slow.  Slow loading - lots of 'fast travel' and the space ships are only really used for combat in orbit.   Space ship design is all the same ""SPACE 1999"" looking and the space suits are all ugly fishbowl designs... very little 'coolness' found there..  So you can try to mod that to make it less dorky.    All and all - there is more of the 'bad' Bethesda is infamous for, and less of the 'good' they are also famous for.   However they do have a mod community to save them from the fire.  With that saftey net, the game is salvageable.    As much as I hate things about it - i'm playing the heck outta it too.

A lot of people will hate on this game because they were probably expecting StarCitizen as a locally installed game, in single player!

Also, they (somewhat rightfully) point out the poorly and shallow written quests - but if you played StarCitizen indeed, you cannot help notice that NPC AI in Starfield >>> NPC AI in StarCitizen, where all NPCs act as if they are in that movie, Invasion of the Body Snatchers :)), creepily standing arround togheter etc !

At least, Starfield NPCs look and move alot more naturally. 
Even in vanilla Starfield, havent noticed any of the weird NPC behavior StarCitizen has! So from this point of vue, immesion is heads and tails above StarCitizen!

Exploration - indeed, here, StarCitizen has the upper hand and the Creation engine shows its limitations. 
But its not nearly as bad as people say it is!

People who judge games by comparing it to gta or rdr2 and shooting the water for 5 minutes to see if it's splashes are physically accurate - ngl, you are retarded. This same fucking thing happened to Cyberpunk before. 
If you are expecting Starfield to be a space sim like Star Citizen + to have stealth like in Deus Ex + to be a narrative rpg like Baldur's Gate 3 AND to have a realistic physics and NPCs like RDR2 -  you are setting yourself for disappointment bacause no game can do all of those things together, it's just impossible. 

But Starfield does so many things at the same time that no other game does.  It has great stories and questlines with different outcome depending on your choices and factions that you can find or unintentionally miss; it has a really well thought out lore; it has an enormous world that just has so much in it - it's insane, the amount of small details, hidden things or funny encounters is staggering. It has an amazing outpost system, really well thought-out ship builder, amazing Hand-crafted cities and locations, you'll have companions with their own smissions and quest lines (you can even marry them!), the art design is gorgeous, your character's perks actually influence gameplay, the UI is great (NASA style badges as the art for perks is so creative), ther's a contraband system, there's piracy, there's bounty hunting. It's simply so engaging just playing it and be constantly disctracted by another interesting thing after another so you'll just find yourself at 5 AM in the morning completing another task that you set for yourself. 

The dialogues are actually good this time in a Bethesda game. Your perks, background and traits can lead to a different outcome, personally I was surprised that I can actually role play in a game from Todd Howard. 

The complaints regarding loading screens are just unjustified. There are loading screens BUT did you actually see how much stuff is in this game's  locations? I mean ALL the small objects are interactable and have a physical 3D model and there are a lot of obects here. It's a necessary compromise to have loading screens. It would definately be better without them but is it fair to ask AND the insane amount of physical objects AND to have no loading screens?

Starfield,1716740,202405824,"It pains me to make this a negative review, but despite this game being mediocre, I can't bring myself to mark it as worth playing. 

I love Bethesda Games. I've been playing their titles since Morrowind on the original Xbox and this was the first game that didn't click with me. Fallout 4 didn't keep my attention as well as Skyrim, Oblivion, or Fallout 3 did, but this was a new level of disconnect. It is a good to great looking game with some pretty decent combat but everything else just falls immensely flat. 

The singular most important aspect of this style of game is missing - exploration. Which is astonishing given how absolutely huge the gameworld is. Thousands of planets that would take thousands of hours to see the entirety of. But they hod nothing of value aside from a handful of copy pasted points of interest and randomly generated terrain. Exploring boils down to visiting a new planet with slightly different foliage and colors than the last one, setting down near a building with almost the exact same layout as the previous one, only to find randomly generated loot that either has no use or no personality. I don't care to explore any of the thousands of worlds  because I know that there will be nothing worth searching for. Even the handcrafted locations like cities or areas made for missions feel like they don't have anything worth searching for. If all of the loot is randomly generated (or at least feels like it), then why would I even both trying to search for it if I'm just as likely to find it in a store?

Another huge issue with the game is a lack of immersion that largely stems from one place: Loading screens. Enter your ship? Loading screen. Sit in your seat and take off? Loading screen. Fast travel to another planet? Loading screen. Land on a new planet? Loading screen. Exit your ship? Loading screen. I am constantly made aware that I am playing a video game. At least in their previous titles like Skyrim or Fallout 4, the only real loading screens you would see would be while entering or exiting buildings. You could spend hundreds of hours in the open hub aspect of the world and never see a loading screen, but since there are 1000's of planets here, there are thousands more loading screens. 

But it's real cardinal sin is that it is just boring. 

Combat is a step up from their previous games but still nothing to really write home about. The story is equally as inoffensive with no real drive. You can tell that they really learned from the previous games by basically making the tutorial levels only take about 10 minutes but I was not hooked by the story at all. Most of the missions are standard RPG quests about fetching an item or talking to a person so you can shoot their friends in the face. There are very few missions that do anything remotely interesting and many of them are relegated to side quests. I feel like it's impossible to say ""No"" in certain scenarios, where characters will just railroad you towards taking the missions despite your refusal. I also feel like many of my dialogue choices have no effect on the outcome of the mission or the story so I often question why they even let me choose responses to begin with. 

The art style on the other hand is absolutely fantastic. They obviously took a lot of inspiration from real life and sci-fi designs from real NASA design documents to Alien, to Dead Space, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Star Trek, the list goes on and on. And yet, it feel cohesive like everything fits together without feeling out of place. There is definitely some inconsistency with how much attention certain locations get. Obviously story locations get more attention and care put in their item placement and set dressing, but it feels like everything else is just randomly generated. If a quest marker doesn't take you there, it felt like it was more than likely never even given a second glance. 

I could go on and on. Every now and again I feel the itch to give it another try. Maybe I missed something or maybe this time it will click for me. But it never does. This is my fourth attempt in the past 2 years and I feel like I don't need to see anymore after only playing for 3 hours.

I think the game play is alright, I'd enjoy it more without the unending stuttering and audio drops. 

The story so far is extraordinarily basic. Very basic things don't make sense, until you realize they're made that way just to have a tutorial or to progress the story, not because it's what any person, crew, or life-form would actually do.

During my time with the game during the few day early access period, I did enjoy quite a bit of the game, and that's what Starfield does do well, is makes you think you've got a lot of depth to the game, when really, once you dig into that apple pie, you learn that most of the pie is 99.9% crust, and 0.1% filling. I really did enjoy the new character customization options  such as pronoun control and even a few in depth options like walking style and I was hyped for the whole traits and backgrounds system, but it really ended up all falling flat for me. It took Bethesda nearly a full year to release mod support, and by then, the game was dead in the water.

This is a classic Bethesda experience, for better or worse. The story is fifteen minutes of content spread across 100+ hours. The companions WILL just begin sprinting in a random direction upon entering any shop. The NPC models WILL warp into body horror as they try to speak to you with limbs sticking out of walls, heads twisted at 180 degrees, etc. 90% of the skill tree is completely worthless. They even added a jetpack in an attempt to streamline the process of jumping up the side of a mountain.

I haven't enjoyed the Elder Scrolls games, but as a fan of both the Fallout series and space exploration games in general, I had high hopes for this one. I ended up just missing all the other games this should've emulated. If you want fulfilling space/planetary exploration, play No Man's Sky. If you want a satisfying spacefaring story or compelling crewmates, play Mass Effect. If you want a collectathon, play Super Mario Odyssey. 

Narratively, this game is the usual humdrum process of showing up somewhere, immediately being told that you're the most important person who ever existed for some half-baked reason, and then getting booted out to door to solve everyone's problems. There's very rarely any personal connection to be made with these quests. Mostly it just feels like driving for GrubHub: point A, grab item, point B. The main quest itself is that you're looking for rocks, but don't worry - they're very inportant rocks. And when you get to the super-special thrilling post-game content... you're still looking for rocks. Groundbreaking writing here and not all derivative.

This game is a failure when it ""works"", but don't be fooled - it's still got plenty of game-breaking bugs. For one example, after getting amped up to run the Red Mile (a kind of challenge gauntlet), my game immediately crashed upon first setting foot on the path. It did this somewhat consistently upon several repeat attempts.

For a second example, in a certain late game mission, my quest marker led me to a dead-end. I later learned that the NPC I needed to speak to in order to proceed with the mission no longer existed. (His day off, I guess.) I was (thankfully?) able to proceed through the mission by using an upgrade skill to manipulating a guard into opening the door for me. You may ask, ""Why not just pickpocket the key from the guard?"" I tried. The guard had no key in his inventory, but was able to open the door anyway. Thanks, Bethesda.

Starfield,1716740,202328279,"This game has potential. But the negatives are just overwhelming. 
The elder scrolls and fallout series are both based around the idea of exploring an interesting world. Starfield is absolutly not. The World feels extreamly empty. Generally you are not rewarded for exploration. if you want to explore some waypoint on the map, you are generally ""Rewarded"" with walking minutes through empty worlds, without any interesting locations, just to fight the same enemies. 

There are only very few enemies in the game. So there is NO variety and combat is fun, but very repetetive. 
Skyrim and Fallout generally reward the player to explore the world, Starfield does not. From the mid game on, you will travel everywhere  by fast travel. But also the Fast travel funcion is restricted, just so that you have to ""jump from Star-System to Star-System"", and watch the animation again. 

Also why is the landing, docking and take off animations not skipable? you are going to see hundreds, or even more of the same animations. The sound of your engine during Take off really got burned into my ears. 

Also, whay do computers sound exactly the same as they did in Fallout? sholdnt the sound like ""more modern""?

And the Plot. Oh my god. I dont know what happened there. But the Plot is full of extremly unbelievable characters. 
In the first five minutes: You are an minter on some unimportant planet. You are an nobody. After some events, there arrives an explorer, who just gives you his space ship!? What? Why on earth would somebody give his spaceship to some nodbody he just met one minute ago? You would never give yours car to somebody you just met, even if that person was involved in some extraordinary event. 

Later the Plot stays equally ludacris. I am not talking about the events of the story, but rather the actions, and reactions of the characters. I have never seen such unbeliveable characters. I genuinly breaks immersion and made me laugh. Laughing not because of some joke, but laughing in disbelive about the writing. 

For the money they charge, i expect more.

Starfield,1716740,202327982,"Like many games of the modern era that make big promises: This one drops the ball on almost all of them. I know that, you know that, whatever redeeming qualities this game might have are dropped by how much of the games problems need to be modded out instead of just being fixed or patched. My reasons?

1. Prejudiced against Hoarders. I am one of those gamers that grew up on The Elder Scrolls, and the philosophy of TAKE LITERALLY EVERYTHING  YOU CAN is ingrained in my DNA at this point. This makes any game that has mountains of loot but extremely limited storage ability when you can have a base of some kind actively stress inducing. 0/10 for that.

2. Outpost Building. Something which seems to be a theme in Bethesda Open World Games of late, the outpost building in this game is like a really badly imported version of the outpost building in Fallout 76, which is itself a really terrible imported version of the settlement building in Fallout 4. An extremely small limit to defences (Seriously, 6 turrets?), no vanilla way to build a decent looking settlement with things like walls, foundations, etc, Hostile life forms constantly spawning in the middle of the base and therefore (just like Fallout 4's biggest pet peeve for me, bypassing solid defences) causing huge problems as I try to kill them, and my need to build MASSIVE STACKS OF STORAGE CONTAINERS (See point one, I am a hoarder in video games) make the Vanilla experience with Outposts tedious for someone like me that likes to make nice looking settlements. 

3. NEEDING to mod the game for it to be playable. I literally, in order to actually keep playing the game, had to mode the thing. I encountered game-breaking bugs (that I think still haven't been fixed, I wouldn't know, I haven't even had the game installed in ages), such as my ship regularly deleting itself at landing ports, other setpieces/ships being fused with my own and therefore making combat/flight/looking at the game impossible. These needed Console Commands to repair, but if you use the console it disables Achievements, etc, etc... LAUNCH YOUR GAMES COMPLETE BETHESDA.

4. Ship Building/Corridor Spaghetti. In order to make the large Mobile Base/home that I like to build for my Single Player RPG games where such an option is possible, it took over 8 hours. EIGHT ACTUAL HOURS. The reason? Corridor connections are entirely randomly generated by the in-game AI. Which means you get labyrinths that make absolutely no sense instead of a well thought out and nice ship interior that makes no sense whatsoever. You have to painstakingly ensure that wherever you want doors you have FORCED the game to make those connections through numerous tips and tricks, etc. Having to run around to every different supplier instead of just being able to access everything from your Outpost/Home Base landing pad is a form of tedium that we could have done away with. I guarantee that any company in space that sells parts/products would be more than happy to charge increased prices for delivery to remote systems using private couriers/shipping. Honestly I think this was the biggest thing that pissed me off...

Didn't even finish the main storyline. I went back to playing Stardew Valley instead. If you don't have this game, don't bother unless all you want to do is build a quick ship and do all the quests as opposed to building a Character Story.",False,0,14773

Starfield,1716740,202318790,"I initially rated the game 5/10, but after playing more of the main story and side missions I give it 2/10. I think it's the worst quest design I've ever seen. It's the ""poop quests in old WoW were more entertaining"" level of bad. 

There are some of things that Starfield does well: combat, ship & space travel stuff (I didn't even hate the loading screens that much) and audio design. Suit, gun and ship models looks fantastic. There was a couple of really fun quests - I did like the Trackers faction one, where you get to fight a bunch of enemies in zero gravity. 

Starfield's biggest sins are:
1.  Horrible quest design - 90% of the quests are fetch and ""follow a very slow npc for 5 minutes to receive yet another fetch quest"" kind of quests. The fetch quests will take all across the Universe too, which mostly just means a lot of loading screens. There's also an unholy number of quests overall - your log is going to be a total mess. I also absolutely loathe the fact that you can't refuse/drop quests. 
The biggest offender, though, are the power collecting quests, which go like this: go to the temple, which is in the middle of yet another barren planet, find a door, unlock the door, float around the room catching glowy stuff for about 2 mins, get the power, fight a guy outside of the temple. Rinse and repeat 10 more times! I did two of those and decided I needed to stop wasting my time with Starfield.

2. Truly atrocious NPC models. They look like the belong in 2005. There are plenty of AA companies out there that are doing a much better job with much more limited budgets, so what is exactly Bethesda's excuse? 

3. Writing - I just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters or stories.",False,0,1990

Starfield,1716740,202308355,"This is going to be one of the most painful reviews I've done. I have, regrettably, 300+ hours in this game. For the love of god, don't do that to yourself. I am clearly NOT WELL and easily susceptible to delusions. I tried so hard to believe I was playing a good game in those 300 hours. At first I thought it was misunderstood. Then I thought it was uniquely for me. Then I thought it had potential, and that I could fix it, so I downloaded the creation kit. Then I finally beat the game, and it hit me, this wasn't good. 

It's issues:
1. Plots bad. Quite boring and stale. Being ""starborn"" is so absurd I can't believe it's real. The ending twists and reveals are lackluster or eye-roll worthy. About the only interesting reveal was what happened to Earth and that's mildly interesting.
2. Some of the side quest lines are interesting like the Crimson Fleet and UC Vanguard but they still feel held back a bit. The other side quests just lack meat to their stories. 
3. I think a lot of the world building and aesthetics are decently handled, but just not in depth enough, especially given this is the first entry in a new, original IP.
4. Exploration is absolutely killed. I know I'm beating a dead horse here but the random points of interest on a randomly generated square of land is not fun, and the vehicles they added barely helped. 
5. Space is practically pointless considering you can't fly to different planets, everything is fast travel essentially. As a result, the cool ship customization ultimately feels a little pointless. 
6. Underwhelming main cities. New Atlantis is impressive for Bethesda but is unbelievable as a CAPITOL CITY for the majority of what is left of humanity. I literally drew up plans for an expanded New Atlantis because I just wanted it to be good SO BAD. Neon makes sense size wise but i still feel it should be much bigger or at the least not split up with loading screens. And Akila City is just kind of pathetic. Could've had a bunch of smaller towns outside of it giving it kind of a mini Skyrim feel to match it's Whiterun feel. 

And so many other minor things that just add up. It's a shame because i thoroughly enjoy it's semi-grounded approach to future space travel and aesthetic. I really like the ship building but i am the type of person that spent time in the gummy ship editor in KH I am not normal. Base building is similarly fine, I'm just definitely willing to put up with bad base building because I enjoy it so much. I like the design of the ship parts and interiors and the lore and purpose of all of the different ship manufacturers.

But most importantly, the reason I kept playing is i LOVE space. I love the idea of space travel and I like that this fictional vision was near future instead of waaaay in the future. I was so locked in on the idea that I could design my ship, interior layout and exterior, decorate it, fly it (barely), and fight with it. It's like Star Citizen, but i can customize my ship. It's like No Man's Sky, but I can customize and walk around my ship. Except it's not like those games all. This game has the one thing those 2 games lack, an actual story, and it's not even good. At least it's SOMETHING compared to those games, and if I could have the perfect mixture of those 3 games, I'd probably never play anything else again.

But this is NOT. THAT. GAME. 

This is what feels like the final nail in the coffin for Bethesda. Conceptually flawed, this seems unsalvageable. Creation Kit modders seem to want nothing to do with it, except the ones utilizing the creation club, which is going to cost you even more money. Bethesda publishing their own stuff on there at the cost of MORE MONEY when the game is horrendously lackluster on launch is such a kick in the nuts. I have yet to play the actual DLC expansion, but I hear it's not helping very much. I don't think this game can pull a No Man's Sky, no matter how badly I wanted it to. 

3/10",False,5,14917
Starfield,1716740,202308228,"This is a pretty interesting situation where I find myself wanting to play more of the game, but also running into bad writing and atrocious AI so often that I'm considering throwing out my 40 hour character to restart using an unarmed build with an AI mod installed.

This is your typical Bethesda writing, think Fallout 4 style nonsense. There's a quest where you need to get a thing to go to a place, and there is an important security-related person who has the thing you need to get in. This person doesn't know you, you're not disguised, you are just a random stranger. 
Do you:

A. Pickpocket the item? 
B. Steal it from their room? 
C. Blackmail them to get it?
D. None of the above?

It's D. You just, persuade them. ""I think we'd both like this to work out"" to paraphrase one of the persuasion options. ??? This person who is responsible for keeping the doohickey safe has no clue who I am, why am I even able to attempt to persuade them to give it to me in this context??? There's no reason they would even consider this, if there was any care put into writing their dialogue. Truly one of the most Fallout 4 meme compilation worthy interactions I've ever seen.

As for the AI, I went on a mission to assault a pirate settlement. Killed some dudes in combat, broke in, stole the thingy I needed to steal, and afterward I was ambushed leaving the facility. Cool!

Except the 4 Sharpshooter AI enemies ran all the way down the hill on the opposite side of the settlement and took cover behind rocks that were like.. 500 meters away from any chance to shoot me. So I hunter them all down, one by one, took about 4 minutes to kill the 4 dudes. Just such a weird tedious combat encounter. Broke into a space station, started shooting guys. There's like 14 enemies in the station, but I'm only ever fighting like 3 at a time, the other 11 can't hear my unsuppressed gunshots or grenades going off around the corner?

As with other bethesda games, the game starts off really interesting then it gets really slate.

What keeps this game alive are the mods. I had to install ""cheat"" mods to enjoy this game. Some of the ""cheat"" mods I installed are mods that grant more credits, XP, unlocks and better loot. Without those cheat mods, you will be forever grinding and this takes away all the fun.

Also, I had to cheat to survive space dogfights. I had to design my ship such that it looks like a flying abomination. It basically looks at Christmas candy bar. The center mass is designed to be hollow for me survive space dogfights.

Starfield,1716740,202277529,"Most of my time spent playing the game has been in the Game Pass version, but  I absolutely love Starfield. The more I play it, the more I love it. When Starfield was first released it was widely believed that the best thing to do was to finish the main story to gain access to new game plus features, so thats exactly what I did. 


However, upon doing a little research, I discovered that I cheated myself out of all that the game had to offer, so I started a brand new game. 

The amazing thing is, for most of this time I’ve had absolutely no interest in finishing the game. Now mods are available and that feeling of not being interested in completing the main story has only increased.

However, as a person that loves Starfield and everything about it, It does feel kind of strange that I have yet to experience new game plus, so my genius idea to solve that problem was to buy Starfield on another platform, which is the steam platform. 

But this is also good because Steam players get the red carpet treatment when it comes to video games. For example, Steam players are allowed access to any new content that Bethesda releases approximately two weeks before everyone else, including PC players like myself who purchased the game through Microsoft…which is kinda weird, but such is the power of Steam due to their dominant position in the industry.

Starfield is so rich with things to do it really can be overwhelming. If you’re looking for a game that will mainline you through the games main story and side quests with unavoidable action scenes and violent encounters with creatures and human NPCs, Starfield isn’t that game. 

For that, I would suggest Mass Effect, which I often still play even today.

In Starfield, you reach a point where you can play the game for countless hours without even touching the main story. In fact, you could have an encounter with an NPC that could change the result of other side quest. 

Some category of side quest may seem mundane, but the intention of those side quest is to introduce you to locations in the game that you may otherwise never experience. For example, you may deliver a bottle of wine to someone on a space station. But while visiting that station you may encounter an NPC who needs help with one thing or another. 

You can join a number of factions that offer a plethora of missions and task to tackle. For example, after knocking out numerous missions for the mysterious Ryujin Industries I was summoned back to Ryujin towers to be informed that my performance was so impressive that I’ve received a promotion and my own office, equipped with my very own mission board terminal.

But honestly, you can spend hours in Starfield playing its research and crafting system. You could have so much cargo coming in and out of your outpost it can begin to sound like a major metropolitan airport. 

I absolutely love the research and crafting process in Starfield. Starfield has a ton of nice armor and weapons but it means nothing if you can’t upgrade them. 

Experiencing the difference and effectiveness of your weapons and armor after upgrading them is very satisfying, especially when you’re playing on very hard difficulty. It really makes a difference. 

I also love the way the ship combat is designed…the way it gives you the choice, provided your ship has the right weapons, to either completely destroy the ship, or to simply damage the engines, allowing the player to board the ship to loot it, or takeover the entire ship. 

After doing so, you could either sell it or put it in your personal ship lineup. 

I also love it when enemy ships are pursuing you aggressively and hitting you with a barrage of missiles. You really feel the heat of the enemies pursuit and their determination to destroy you. 

And Bethesda didn’t cut corners in this area. While being aggressively pursued by a few enemy ships, just out of curiosity, I once went into photo mode to see what was going on outside of my ship as I was attempting to get away. 

The outpost building is amazing. There is nothing else like it in any other space game.

I don't know how the base game of Starfield is because I haven't touched it and won't but I will say, I am enjoying the Genesis adaptation of the game (25 hours in). 

Overall viewpoint: Reminds me of Battlefront but with some quests thrown in and a little bit of free will. If you want to play a bounty hunter in the SW universe, I recommend picking it up when it is on sale.

Pros so far: 
1. Good lore system (Star Wars). It is cool seeing familiar faces and star systems
2. Ranged combat is fun. Reminds me of the old Battlefront 1 and 2.
3. Quests are interesting enough to keep me wondering where the story will go
4. Ship building. I really like the ability to create your own ship. Although it took me a while to figure out wtf I was doing and doing wrong lol

Cons:

1. Melee combat. Very boring/melee is not fluid and has very limited animations, so don't get this if you are aspiring to be/play a jedi/Sith.
2. Guidance. There is very little guidance on how to do pretty much everything in the game. I'm not sure if this is the case for the base game but with Genesis, there isn't much guidance besides a starting direction/main quest.
3. Running to and from places can be kind of boring but most of the quests don't make you run around on a planet for more than 5 min or so. This is also offset by the ability to fast travel to your ship and such.

It is shocking to me how mixed the reviews are. So much thought has gone into the game. There are differences between this and the other Bethesda games, but I find that it is usually pretty beneficial for every game to not be, you know, the exact same game. Starfield contains so much depth and beauty to the world; the designs of the cities, the scenery from so many of the planets. Even the barren rocky moons that so many people complain about; listening to this fantastic score while sitting in a crater-speckled valley as the sun rises over the horizon and casts long shadows over the mottled landscape was a truly pleasant experience for me. 

I won't pretend it was a flawless experience. There are systems layered on systems layered on systems. I have a liquid-cooled PC, and had to replace sections of tubing that had warped or cracked from the stress of running so hot for so long whole playing the game a half dozen times or so. It crashed at least once per play session. The inventory and resource management system is so janky that not only was it frustrating, but they added a button to ""transfer all resources"" and it was a 50/50 chance that this button would not only crash the game, but the computer itself. That said, this was also the crunchiest any bethesda game has been. The act of spending your meager upgrade points means going through a collegiate process (oh, you want a 300-level skill? Sorry, you need to spend at least 2 more point-hours in 100 or 200-level courses before you have the science background to handle that skill. You want to improve your Botany level? Looks like you have not yet finished the assignment from your last Botany class, to demonstrate you actually learned the skills you were shown). As someone who loves a road-trip, an experience where you have vast expanses of nothing, dotted with small settlements peopled with strangers whose names you don't know, and who may need help, or may outright hate you; that isn't just feel accurate to Space travel, it feels accurate to driving across most of the country. And then every once in a while, there is a vibrant, unique, packed city filled with people and stores and things to do. It just feels good. 

Fortunately, the New Game+ is baked into the story itself, so I did just keep right on playing. 13 hours into a new game, and so far I am finding so much new dialogue, a lot of new experiences.

Technical:
-A little unoptimised and the game save can get bloated within only a couple hundred hours (increases loading time)
-Most stable Bethesda game. Ignore those viral ""clips"" of the game. Dig deeper and you'll find that those are out-of-context clips from people messing around with console commands

Story:
-It's alright. Think of a space sci-fi movie trope and Starfield will probably fit any of them, with a space fantasy-esque twist in the middle
-Though it has RPG elements and choices do matter, it doesn't seem to be the main focus as the writing is a bit flat and outdated

Gameplay:
-Combat is better than one would expect out of a game like this. You can take it slow and fire potshots from cover or you can charge in, use sword and magic to manipulate the entire battlefield and fulfil that Jedi (or Sith) fantasy
-Dialogue choices are quite good and cover most moral stances, allowing us to roleplay as good/ evil as we want

I haven't even touched the main questline or story companions - the moment it let me free roam I was off to explore by myself. I dived into the Outpost system and have mixed feelings - I expected it to be a big improvement over the Fallout 4 settlement system, but I was disappointed. The companion mechanics too I was surprised to see limited functionality compared to issuing direct commands in Fallout 4, or at least telling them to keep a distance or follow close like in New Vegas. Then I went to Neon City and joined a gang for a short series of quests and then joined an evil megacorp - this is when I really got into the game, with this Cyberpunk style storyline. After finishing that questline I joined the Crimson Fleet pirates and had a blast hammering radiant quests, boarding ships and building a custom spaceship with my ill-gotten gains.

 Exploring is boring, in a space game. If you stick to the main areas the game is fine and even has some good moments, but I do not think the current price is appropriate. 

The current modding scene is dead. Bethesda now only allows achievements on certain Creations from their store which upset the modding community because they felt it unfairly incentivised Creations over the free mods. This is a case of ""biting the hand that feeds."" Bethesda's games have long been the supported by modders providing free mods keeping player interest alive for years and allowing for continued sales. Rather than being grateful and continuing this symbiotic relationship Bethesda decided they wanted a bigger piece of the pie and are monetizing the free labor of their community directly now.

I am sure they would argue that now that modders are also making money, what is wrong with that? The issue is two fold. First, Creations add a pay wall to a previously free feature. Part of what made mods great was the ability to endlessly change the game you were playing. You could find cool looking mods try them out and if you didn't like them it was no loss and you could try something else. Some of these Creations are quite expensive and they are all priced with fake digital currency to obfuscate their cost (a dark practice on its own) and it should be obvious why this greatly harms the modding experience. Modding has always been collaborative endeavor, if the people making the mods aren't able to freely play around with mods they lose interest in the game and stop making mods.

The second issue with this excuse is that modders were already making money. The Nexus, the main site everyone uses for modding, has a point redemption system that allowed modders to get some compensation through donations. They also could get donations from other platforms like Patreon or Ko-fi. Bethesda sticking their finger in the pie has complicated things.

Finally don't think for a second that restricting achievements to certain approved mods is for the players. It was never an issue with previous games. This is 100% a ploy to give them more control over the modding scene and to try and force more modders to their platform so they can make money off free labor.",False,1,14342

I played Starfield on release on my Xbox, and playing on Steam rightnow. After going through it, I honestly don't understand all the hate it gets. Sure, the game isn't perfect. there’s valid criticism when it comes to the procedural generation of planets but overall, I think Bethesda did a great job, especially with the ship building mechanics and the Starborn storyline. One thing that really disappointed me, though, was the lack of real conflict between the factions. The game constantly references dramatic wars in the past, but unfortunately, none of that tension really plays out during your time in the game. It felt like a missed opportunity they could've built an awesome Cold War style arc between the factions, which would’ve added a lot of depth to the world.

That said, I still think Starfield did a better job than Fallout 4 in several areas. It’s definitely not a flawless game, but it doesn't deserve the level of hate it’s gotten. It feels like a lot of people just jumped on the hate train because that’s kind of how things are these days.",True,0,2963

One example is The Tracker's Alliance faction mission that pops up in your mission log. It's presented like all the other faction missions, so you assume it's going to be another interesting and substantial questline to experience. Only when you finish the first mission you realize you have to purchase the rest of the missions through creations.

Starfield,1716740,202011809,"Starfield Review: 146 Hours Later and I’ve Ascended Into a Buggy, Glorious Space Nerd

At hour one of Starfield, I thought, “Wow, this could be Skyrim in space!”
At hour 146, I’ve accepted that it’s actually Excel in space, with a faint hint of lore, a sprinkle of combat, and more menu navigation than a 2007 DVD main screen.

Let’s talk about the “vision” here. Todd Howard told us we could “go anywhere.” What he meant was, “You can fast travel to a loading screen, and then fast travel to a slightly different loading screen, and then land on a planet with nothing on it but a rock, six angry space ticks, and a weirdly placed bench.”

Every new planet is like opening a mystery box filled with absolutely nothing. A barren hellscape with the personality of wet cardboard. But somehow,,somehow..I keep going. Because deep down, I am a Starborn. A glowing, cosmic PowerPoint presentation of a person who has now New Game Plus-ed into a full-blown space wizard with a cape and a superiority complex.

And I love it.

The story? Meh. Space politics, cults, multiverse..you know, the usual Thursday night stuff. Honestly, I wasn’t paying attention after I figured out I could throw people across the room with gravity powers like a space Gandalf on pre-workout.

But let's not forget the real magic of Starfield: the ships. Not flying them, no. That would be fun. Instead, building them. For hours. Toggling between modules like a space IKEA engineer who lost the will to live, only to end up with a ship shaped like a toilet that barely flies and somehow weighs more than a neutron star. But you keep doing it. Why? Because your brain is broken and Todd Howard’s got you hooked on virtual clutter and crafting tables.

Speaking of Todd:
Oh, Todd. You magnificent liar. You said there were a thousand planets. You didn’t say 998 of them were procedurally generated deserts with one sad space bear and a half-buried science outpost. At least No Man’s Sky had the decency to admit it was a vibe generator. You? You gave me “NASA-core” aesthetics and said, “This is the future. It’s beige and joyless.”

But here’s the twist. Despite the jank, the bugs, the lifeless planets, the completely baffling UI that requires a PhD in sadness--I’m obsessed. I’ve become the dork I used to mock. I’m walking around in a flowing Starborn cape, muttering about the Unity and acting like I’m some kind of space messiah while looting toilets for credits.

I have spreadsheets for cargo weight. I’ve argued with Vasco like he’s a real person. I’ve shot a pirate in the face because he insulted my ship layout. I am not well.

So yeah, Bethesda, you got me again. Just like you did with Skyrim, Fallout 4, and my childhood. Starfield is a mess, but it’s my mess. A beautiful, sprawling, bug-ridden galactic sandbox where I can pretend I’m important while yelling ""I AM STARBORN"" at the TV in my pajamas.

Starfield,1716740,202007265,"The Jury is still out on the game, and first impressions are mixed. I'm giving it a thumbs up, but that's subject to change with more play.

The game does have more things to do than ""No Man's Sky"", but it's ship play is worse, however unlike the latter you can mod your ship, which is a cool feature, and the locations are so much better. I like NMS's play, but damn it got boring fast, and was exceptionally repetitive.  We'll see how Starfield holds up. It does haves 2 major detractors thus far, it lags badly, even on a robust modern system... and that's with the game settings turned down and dynamic resolution turned off. Reminds me of a bad internet connection. I did try it on a system with the minimum requirements and it was obviously worse, until you got into combat with multiple enemy and it became unplayable. The second is the menu system. It's way too convoluted. Some designers really need a lesson in the ""KISS"" principle. Being it's a Bethesda game, I suppose any fixes will have to come from the MOD community, or not at all.

\\Updated comments\\

Well, the lag problem was 100% due to having installed it on an my second drive which was not an SSD. I rectified that problem by upgrading the drive and all the lag went away and all the scenes load much, much faster now. It even allowed me to turn up the graphic setting back to Ultra. Amazing the difference  between the 2 drive types for game speed. 

After 80+ hours of play, I'm enjoying it, but truthfully there isn't any better than the classic games like Fallout or Skyrim, which are much, much older games. If anything the continual jumping into a ship to go here, there, and everywhere makes it worse. The NPC's are a little better, but the enemy are just raiders in space suits. Except for the cities and bases, the planets themselves are so bad I long for the beauty of Skyrim.

The base building is kind of a joke. In other Bethesda game you could buy prebuilt modules for purchased homes, this one doesn't do that. You hand build everything from an oddly designed list of items, that really doesn't have anything in it. I suppose the modding community will rectify that. The ship building, which is probably the one standout feature, is also lackluster and convoluted. You can't really tell what you're upgrading, or buying, as you have to buy it to look inside. Then it sort of just places portals, ladders, and stuff where it wants to, giving you ""zero"" options to move things around. This could have been done so much better. 

The plant-side interaction and base building is pretty much a waste of time. Unlike NMS where you have a lot of choices for base building, vehicle types, and diverse planet types, Starfield is rather blah. The planets are mostly the same with different atmospheres. There may be better vehicles further in the game, but thus far the ""moon rover"" is a joke. It's like trying to drive around in a vehicle with beach ball tires. Which considering the lousy job they did building environments that are overly, and consistently, strewn with large boulders everywhere, the only way you can get around is bouncing off everything, or bouncing over it. It's more akin to playing a Super Mario brother go-cart racing sim. It really detracts from the type of game you were hoping to play. In that aspect, and actually flying a spaceship, No Man's Sky has Starfield beat by a million light years. 

As for things to do, I'll never really understand the overall concept of continual re-spawning of enemies in the same locations. There's only so many times you will want to attack the same place over and over, just to grab some loot. I think it would be better to either conquer the universe, or free it, and gathering loot and upgrading is a reward for doing it. Spend more time in building quality environments where people will want to spend time in them, instead of just procedural generated bland nothingness. Set most of the stores on each planet, Then you have an entire universe to expand into. You're not surviving, your not expanding, and you're not really exploring, which is what a space game should really be about. That is of course my opinion, but if each plant were it's own DLC, there could be a lot of fun, and money to be had. 

That is also where NMS failed. At some point it's all just repetitious blah. There's no reason to explore when there is nothing to really see, and there's no reason to fight when there's nothing to be gained, or lost. At some point it's really just a more in-depth arcade game, with occasional stories thrown in to break up the monotony. 

You'd think that after all these years, someone at Bethesda would look at what the MOD community is doing, and what the player base is saying, besides just their testing and control groups. There's a wealth of information to be gained, but you have to seek it out, and stay away from the Microsoft mindset of thinking you, and only you, know what's best for everyone else. Are you looking, are you listening?... or are you just patting each other on the back and ""sniffing your own farts"" -  A South Park reference. 

Does any of this mean the game isn't worth playing, no, absolutely not. It has it's fun side, and I've spent many hours proving it to myself, but it could have been better, and it's certainly not worth the hype or the price tag. They really could have made this something, but with poor base building, mediocre ship building, horrible planet-side interaction and ship flying simulation, it's just a 5

Oh, and one thing to add, they really need to fix the NPC continually blocking the damn doorways and cramped aisle-ways.  That has been an issue in all their games. I realize that the NPC are supposed to act like real humans, but is it necessary to make them act like woman at a grocery store?

Starfield,1716740,201987424,"Unfortunatly, Starfield lost what made others Bethesda's Open world so good. A living and interesting map.
In those previous titles, maps were engineered in a way that made players wander around. Quest asks you to go from point A to point B. But since you've not visited point B yet, you can't fast travel, so you have to walk there. And that's when the magic happens. You were bound to stumble on something : a new location to explore, a dungeon, a new questline or an NPC companion.

In Starfield however, since you're going from planets to planets, and they are not physically linked, fast travel is available from the start and actually your only option to get from A to B. So you end up in an awful gameloop of fast travel, talk to npc, fast travel, shoot npc, fast travel talk to npc. Over and over again. No wandering, no feeling of discovery nor exploration which is terrible for a game which story line revolve around space exploration...
Even if you try to force exploration in your game by going to random planets and explore, they feel empty because they are randomly generated from a very limited number of assets. The few locations that are handcrafted (the major cities) actually do feel quite intersting but unfortunatly they are too small.
On top of that the game is quite outdated technologically and the player choices do feel inconsequential a lot of the time. Most dialogues option resumes to yes, yes but being smurk, no, leave conversation.

Starfield is an ""Open World"" space game that mixes gameplay between Fallout 4 and TES: Skyrim in terms of powers. I knew what I was getting into as Bethesda is known for their portfolio of bugs and ""It just works"" attitude. The marketing of this game was promoted as ""NASA-Punk"", which initially caught my interest. Unfortunately, I was not expecting that this game would completely change my view in a negative way towards Bethesda and Microsoft in the video game industry.

Let's start with the game engine itself. It uses Creation Engine 2, an ""upgraded"" version of Creation Engine. This engine really gave mod developers a strong footing in their hobby and the modding community in general. I myself developed several mods in the graphics department for Fallout 4 and Skyrim and studied the engine in terms of graphical perspective. While that is a positive, the engine is extremely outdated technical wise, and based on what I've seen on this game and the promotion of version 2, I see the opposite of an ""upgrade"". And to my understanding, they keep using this engine in hopes of modders to fix and give the mod popularity treatment, which is not a professional move.

[hr]
[b]Here are my problems with this game:[/b]

[olist]
[*]The majority of this game is loading screens - entering a building, entering your ship, entering an elevator, literal movement leads to loading screens which completely eliminates the ""Open World"" aspect of the game. Not good for showcasing the Creation Engine 2's ""upgrade"".

[*]Graphical quality and models are horrible, even at high graphical preset. I doubt the graphical and model departments even cleaned up and optimized their work. Bad model render and low resolution textures and sometimes seams in some aspects. Also, majority of the graphics are behind under filters, the colors feel washed out in some areas which does not give a good presentation in some scenarios, specifically interiors and dungeons. Again, not good for showcasing the Creation Engine 2's ""upgrade"".

[*]General unoptimization and bugs that are even worse than Bethesda's previous works. Again, not good for showcasing the Creation Engine 2's ""upgrade"".

[*]It is interesting to land on a planet which generates new land each time. However, the POIs are very limited and overall feel empty on majority of the planets. You would figure that with the lore technology humanity has gained, you would see some interesting events. Again, not good for showcasing the Creation Engine 2's ""upgrade"".

[*]Game Design is literally broken or doesn't exist. The skill tree does not make sense gameplay wise.

Example #1: In order to upgrade your lockpicking skill, you have to lockpick a level above your current level, but the game will not let you challenge a higher level of what you are currently at. How are you supposed to improve your skills with this gameplay design?

Example #2: The game states that you can be a pirate and smuggle goods, but there is absolutely no way to smuggle. Every time you enter a civilized star system, the authorities will automatically scan your cargo without giving you options or strategies to by-pass it. To summarize, there is no way to be a pirate.
(Edit: Upon researching, there are some ship upgrades that will lower the chance of getting spotted. While at least its better than nothing, but for a AAA game this is not a good solution.)

[*]The story and character writing are absolutely horrible and uninspiring. None of the characters are interesting or engaging. The characters you meet keeps on trauma dumping and are extremely judgmental towards you and the actions you commit. To put it short; you can not win with them. Also, the factions literally feel the same with different hues of colors, all working for the same goal but with different wordplay.

[*]The game is rated M for Mature. However, this game does not deserve that rating at all. This deserves Everyone 10+ at best. All the things I have seen and heard in this game are sanitized to the point where I feel like I am playing ""Hello Kitty Barbie Tea Party Space Adventure"".

Overall, I am extremely disappointed in this game that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I really love the concept of NASA-Punk, but Starfield is an F-rated execution. Bethesda/Microsoft bent the knee to a certain audience which I believe does not exist nor is targeted to the right audience in both customer's and developer's point of view, which ultimately led to execution of poor and not thought-out ideas, especially on storytelling, which is a major flaw on Bethesda's portfolio. This does not give me faith in their future works.",False,7,1261
Starfield,1716740,201955316,"Before the release, I was sceptical but excited.

The dream died during my first session. It should be a criminal offence, for a studio responsible for titles like Skyrim and Fallout to release...this. An inch-shallow puddle, with outdated graphics, practically non-existent narrative and laughably poor mechanics. This is an affront to every single Bethesda supporter.

I don't know where to start and I'm not really keen on saying too much. There are exhaustive reviews telling you everything you need to know about this...whatever this is.

If I didn't know better, I would've believed it's a parody. It's like Inception and Minority Report had an IVF baby, delivered by a doctor with the diploma from Temu. You wake up from one loading screen only to find yourself inside another, and the amount of screens, tabs, submenus you need to go through in order to complete a single task is, for all practical purposes, always +1.

The worst part, to me personally, is the visual side of the game. Everything looks disinfected and plastic. The last-gen lighting is atrocious. There's no perceivable depth in any location you go to. Everything is popping in your face, and sharp, crystal clear contours and colours slap you on the face like you were tripping on something. NPCs look like mannequins and behave like androids. The facial animation is so bad I would pay to have an option to turn it off entirely.

Save your time, save your money, respect your mental health.",False,8,5392
Starfield,1716740,201953068,"Most recent update to this game has made it unplayable.  Nothing works, it crashes at the tutorial, and every update they've put out this last year has broken the game.  I'm throwing in the towel on getting this game to work.  The memory leak from last year that causes this game to not release system resources until it crashes is still here and unfixed and there's no mod to fix it either.  It does not help, by the way, that there's a strictly enforced policy of toxic positivity in the feedback forums (you get banned for even the most innocuous criticism).

This is a turd that Bethesda simply cannot polish no matter what they do.",False,5,29148
Starfield,1716740,201952692,"Well I put some time into the game a while back and was hoping for some recent updates or changes. 
This is completely terrible.

I really wanted a full fleshed games. Not the same ""Dungeons"" repeated with the same enemies and lack of weaponry.",False,3,10141
Starfield,1716740,201949339,"So, spoiler alert... of sorts... this game and its actual storyline is literally designed around the NewGame+ ('NG+') mechanic - a form of 'prestige' progression where, in order to progress the actual storyline, you have to 'start over' multiple times and every time with only your XP and personal skill points/learned abilities from the previous game... no stuff, no ships (spoiler: [spoiler]except for one [/spoiler]), no records of exploration, no previous quest progress.  The whole thing is lazily hand-waved away (almost bordering 4th-wall-breaking) by in-universe techno-babble - and the explanation itself isn't even that compelling... again, pretty lazy. Wouldn't be so bad if it was only one apsect of many in the game - but it's the whole crux of the game and plot.

ALL of the effort of a single playthrough (easily 100s of hours) of exploration, questing, building a home base for yourself, building comraderie with your companions - everything that would appeal to most players  - is completely pointless as none of it actually has any mechanism that allows any of the benefit of that time spent to be carried forward into future progression.  The only thing that you can carry forward, is a single main-story quest, and the hours upon hours of XP earned though what is, at best, a mediocre combat system that can be easily 'cheesed' to make the player OP 99% of the time.  This was a deliberate decision by the game creators, that had the unfortunate side-effect of rendering 90% of what is already over-promised/un-delivered 'full-yet-still-somehow-empty' content in the game utterly pointless.... questing, exploration, socializing, advancements of most kinds... pointless if a player intends on seeing the actual storyline to its conclusion.

The combat system, itself, is not terrible per se, it's just that it is literally the only thing that matters for 'progression' - and that one mechanic, on its own, is not enough to carry the game by ANY stretch of the imagination; as all of the other mechanisms for earning player XP (which, again, is the only thing carried forward to new games) have been nerfed through the ground by the Devs multiple times since the game release, forcing players who legitimately want to experience the actual content of the game (such as it is) to be punished for 'wasting' time on mechanics that offer nothing of value to actual game progression. Sure, if you want to play casually and never start a new game after your current playthrough, you can build-out and explore to your heart's content, but you're literally missing out on the Main Storyline. 

Should you choose to finally pursue that main story, be prepared to give up EVERYTHING you've done in a single game - and not in a fun way.  The tradeoff of this 'forced' NewGame+ mechanic is just objectively bad and very poorly implemented by the game creators - which wouldn't be so bad if the actual storyline wasn't so... flat and uninspired.

StarField has consistently been a game where there is SO MUCH potential in the gameworld that has been created - but bone-headed and extremely short-sighted decisionmaking on the part of the initial game creators (and now also the current Devs) have rendered what should have been an exceptional era-defining title into an excercise in tedium; tedium made all the worse in that 90% of it doesn't matter since you can't carry it forward, and the 10% that does carry forward is simply not compelling enough to justify the rest.

Starfield is two different game archetypes rolled into one... unfortunately, the two archetypes are fundamentally incompatible with one another. All the execs who signed off on trying to blend the two genres together should be taken out back and horse-whipped - whichever game archetype you choose to play through, you will only be playing 'half' the game at any one time - and be fundamentally cutoff from the other half, which makes trying to play both at once all the more painful. I personally prefer the 'open world ARPG you can play for 100s of hours' aspect of the game over the 'grind the prestige system' (aka NG+) over and over for advancement and the [i][b]chance[/b][/i] (not guaranteed) to get differences or changes in each new univers... erm... NewGame+ run.

[i]Disclaimer: I got this title for free a few days before launch because it came bundled with an AMD GPU I was already planning on purchasing - the free game came as a surprise. I wasn't planning on purchasing regularly, but I thought I would give it a try since it was Bethesda.... needless to say, it's been quite the disappointment.[/i]

the $60 pricetag is... not worth it.  If it gets a steep discount (50% or more) in the future, then I could suggest picking up the title, just so that players can experience that first playthrough and all the gameworld has to offer to a first-time player.  Unfortunately, players need to know that they will be missing out on the resolution of the main storyline should they choose not to allow themselves to be 'penalized' by the making use of the NG+ mechanic that forces the loss of ALL previous gametime invested in the game, except the combat XP.

I would not recommend purchasing the DLC... at all... ever.  It doesn't add enough to justify ANY pricetag, and paid DLC for a game so filled with wasted potential does not really deserve to be rewarded with additional $.


[i][b]REVIEW UPDATE:[/b]  The devs of the game (Finally!) ended up streamlining the add-on functions of the game, so that players did not have to rely on 3rd party Add-On managers (like Nexus Mods, etc).  Unfortunately, even though most of the addons are literally ONLY COSMETIC and do not affect actual gameplay in any way, any addons that a player installs (except a few select in-house addons) will disable achievement progress unless those addons are PAID versions.  Literally the exact same addons, with no code changes, are forced (by the Devs) to become paid addons that ask for real life $$ (so that the Devs get a % cut of that purchase) and suddenly become 'achievement-friendly' when installed despite the aforementioned no need to actually change the code itself.  This had quite the chilling effect on the addon development community, and as such there are a lot of abandoned addons out there now because of that decision (and the fact that the game is just not that great to begin with, despite its immense potential).  If you don't care about achievements, then it's probably no big deal - but if you're someone who already struggles with accepting games with NewGame+/Prestige mechanics like this, then the loss of achievement progress over added COSMETICS will likely make that pill all the harder to swallow[/i]

Starfield,1716740,201944482,"I spent 30 hours on this game and completed the main quest. 95% of it was ""go get this"" or ""go kill this"". Horrible writing via several outsourced studios. 

Dialogue, I'm not exaggerating, couldn't be anything less than a 6th grader's doing. I wouldn't believe any studio employee that told me AI wasn't used for most of the cringey/boring/childish characters and dialogue choices. Companions constantly interrupt you to talk about moronic things like ""how they fit in"" or ""my kid keeps leaving her tools out"" despite literally spending hours ravaging through other people. It just doesn't make any sense. Poor writing.

Graphics are on par with other games I played 10 years ago. That's all I got for that. They're not great. They're not horrible. Outdated.

The game they supposedly spent ""10 years on"" is no less than a space set Fallout 4, minus interesting world immersion. They somehow thought just jamming a map full of random planets and fetch quests/kill orders was going to be up to par with Fallout and TES. Shitty plot, shitty FPS combat, shitty ship combat,  shitty world immersion, and overall just an embarrassment. This studio developed Skyrim 14+ years ago, and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna hold off on TES6 if this is the path BGS is going down. This is clearly a cash grab void of artistic writing or effort in general and is a testament to a studio at the end of their road.

Now to be fair, a few main story quests were interesting, and I won't spoil them. The UC/Crimson Fleet faction questline was interesting. Ship building and configuring is fun, although it takes a while before you can really get into it (which is understandable in terms of pacing the game).

The Gameplay is just copy-pasted from Fallout 4. There is nothing else to be said.

Starfield,1716740,201811277,"Starfield is one of those games that I really want to love.

I'm a big fan of Bethesda's work, first being introduced to them through Morrowind. But Starfield is the first game from Bethesda that I can't recommend, and I keep trying to find that same feeling Morrowind gave me.

Starfield has a lot going for it. Ship battles and customization can be fun. The same kind of Fallout-esque first person shooter style fun with a lot of loot to sort through. By all accounts this SHOULD be a hit.

The issues where this games struggles, and where I see several space type games failing, is the transition between space and planets. So much of this game is loading screens because you load to travel to a planet, you load to land, you briefly load to get out of your ship, and if you're real lucky, you'll load again to enter a building. And then you'll spend a brief time in that area and end up doing that all again just to sell off your loot.

While I get the attempt to make a more realistic space game, I'm furious that every person you speak with is human... if you're going to make a space game without aliens, you need to make me care about the different factions in the story, and to be honest, they're pretty lame. The only faction that made me care was the UC sysdef, and that's because I really want to kill their leader everytime I accidentally get caught with contraband I didn't even know was on this ship I'm trying to register...

Setting up outposts, researching, making weapon and armor mods, these should all be less painful systems. I try my best to utilize those systems because that's such a big chunk of getting the weapons you want, but it is such a time suck.

EDIT: Another point I thought of that absolutely drives me crazy is how the best stories in this game are the things you heard about that happened in the past, or that you find through writing. I understand that lore and world building is a key point for Bethesda games, but if you're offering me the choice between a time where I have to listen to an ultra-wealthy man and a priest argue about whether a space rock was sent from god or not, or a time where there are interplanetary battles taking place with xenowarfare and mechs, I'm going to choose the latter... there are also so many points in the game where they could have leaned further into the space horror or cosmic horror of the game, and they don't. Basically what I'm saying is this is the unseasoned chicken of games, and I know for a fact there's a whole spice rack that could have been used...

----SPOILERS BELOW!!!!----

While I love the endgame idea of kind of restarting the whole thing from the beginning, and letting you choose how you approach that restart, there's not enough in the game to make me care about that.

Ultimately, I'll keep coming back to this game from time to time, but it'll never be quite what I'm looking for.",False,5,15997
Starfield,1716740,201807433,"Starfield is an open-world game following the same familiar formula as other Bethesda games. Interactive NPC followers, shops, resource management, outpost building, character customization, skill specialization, leveled lists, etc. 

However, Starfield builds upon these staples with procedural world terrain generation as well as the unique-to-Starfield (for Bethesda) space exploration and starship builder. There is a good amount of complexity in outpost management, weapon/armor/ability customization, and starship building/management, and you will definitely find yourself short on time to complete everything you want long before you run out of customizations to complete. There are the usual supply of abundant main and side quests to immerse yourself in the various factions and character stories of the game, including purchasing home sites at some locations which can also be customized with furnishings inside. 

Unfortunately, there is a short supply activities to enjoy outside of quest lines and resource management tasks available in the game. So those without the motivation to conquer complexity may quickly run out of reasons to play after completing quest lines. 

The combat becomes pretty redundant quickly as the NPC enemies are overly-scripted in combat, including in space (enemies are immovable rubber-banding objects that aren't tethered to any type of physics and have scripted movements until defeated, at which point they become rag doll objects you can push around).

There is a good variety of alien lifeforms to discover and combat in the game, providing the most thrilling combat experiences in the game (Think a hammerhead shark and a T-Rex mix chasing you through a forest!). They greatly outshine all other combat situations (human and starship) and feel the most immersive without question.

General NPC dialogue is enough to feel slight immersion in and out of combat, so long as you don't spend too much time talking to them (you will start to notice the slim variety of voices and lines). 

Companions are useful in combat and while exploring planets, but feel incredibly lackluster in character development (there are literally no activities unique to them outside of scripted dialogue backstories and relationship satisfaction metrics that affect dialogue with the player character). Companions surely shine their best as carefully assigned starship crew when combat arises (they provide many awesome benefits to your ship's capabilities that are unattainable without them). 

All-in-all this game is a homage to players who yearned for expansive worlds that technology could not yet provide in the old days, and to lovers of single player self-paced story-telling and character progression you can pick up and play as much or as little as you like when you have time. Yet Starfield will struggle to satisfy modern gamers who seek content variety, online play and mod support. 

Not the best open world game out there (I even prefer Fallout 4 in many ways over it), but it is certainly one of the largest to explore. 

Not a lot of immersion or control of star ships other than very basic combat in planetary orbit and shipbuilding itself, but enough customization variety to create a semi-believable star ship ownership experience. 

Character appearance customization is one of the highlights, although clothing choices are easily among the worst I have ever experienced in a game. So you'll enjoy making your character, so long as you don't mind dressing them like an NPC afterwards. 

Bethesda has given us our first land vehicle (and it is MUCH appreciated!), but it tries to be a Mass Effect Mako without approaching the same combat effectiveness. It will make your planetary travels MUCH faster, but provides literally no other usable benefits (the one weapon it has does just enough damage to aggro enemies). 

This game feels VERY dumbed down and excels at nothing to create a neutrally-consistent experience for everyone. Unfortunately that consistency quickly becomes repetition and monotony during extended play. 

The quests are rich in backstory, though the activities are repetitive (go here, kill this). There is unfortunately no strategy or problem solving outside of Digipicks (lock-picking) due to the scripted combat movements of enemy NPC (they literally just rubber band in combat and possess no physics until defeated). Even in tasks where you are given the opportunity to choose between stealth or brute force (such as bounty hunter quests), the choice is really just a scripted dialogue choice that is specific to scripted quest line situations only (like unique one-time bounty targets). Every open world repeatable quest is simply shoot and kill. Even if you disarm enemies with non-lethal EM weapons, they won't allow you to take them as a prisoner. The only effective use of EM weapons is to neutralize native lifeforms to harvest (which provides no benefit over killing them outright and then harvesting them) and the very scripted mission in New Atlantis where you must not kill any hostile citizens. 

I love the game, but it feels very rushed out or stripped down regarding content enrichment. It is very well-polished and gorgeous though. 

I rate story development 7/10 for rich dialogue, numerous cutscenes specific to your choices in the game, and generous experience gains from quests, but lack of mission variety, unique quest rewards and overly-basic companion interactions.

I rate combat 4/10 for cool weapon customization, but scripted enemy combat movements, rubber banding and lack of weapon variety (no rockets, no special kill visuals, no grappling, no melee combat outside of single-slashing with blade) causing combat to become boring very quickly.

I rate exploration 6/10 for immense landscapes, unique procedurally generated maps, cool diversity of biomes and huge variety of creatures, but no aquatic or submerged exploration (the surface swimming is more of an insult as it kills you on almost all planets), no activities outside of scripted quest lines, copy and pasted locations and a lack of variety in location diversity (often putting lush tropical oasis in the middle of frozen biomes or placing frozen icebergs in the middle of a completely arid desert biome as copium)

I rate outpost/starship building and management 7/10 for immensely detailed customization, complex mechanics, freedom of choice, and facility progression tied seamlessly to character progression and build, lacking meaningful activities with other characters, and limited control of active base/ship functions (you can't ""fly"" your starship wherever you'd like, most instances are replaced with a copy and pasted take-off/landing cutscene.  

My overall rating of the game is 6/10. It is a replayable open-world shooter with an emphasis on base-building and resource management. But it does not reward extended play once you have completed quest content.",True,1,65082

Starfield,1716740,201791068,"I've spent over 700 hours on Starfield, and I've unlocked every achievement. Starfield is a game I enjoy playing, but it has issues making sense. It feels like two different games: the enjoyable and addictive Bethesda gameplay loop, and a world that seems like it was created by a group, where each piece of lore contradicts the others.

I loved the shipbuilding mechanic; it's one of the best parts of the game. For a game with exploration as a main selling point, it's not engaging, and the rewards are not there. Scanning planets for slates, that's it.

I do not mind the procedural generation and the POIs, but the repetitiveness of them will bore you. Environmental storytelling was missing; the only POI I remember with this was the pirate base on Kreet. Why is there a research lab on this planet? Why did the Ecliptic raid this mine? Why is a group of scientists here? What are they researching?

Combat is good; I'm not a fan of fast-paced shooters, so for me, it's good and enjoyable. It must have been nice to have more variety of weapons, though.

NPCs will forget who you are, even if you met them before (looking at you, Admiral Logan).

This is a problem similar to Skyrim. You can be a pilot for the UC Vanguard (even one of the founders of UC's new division), a Freestar Ranger, and a member of the Crimson Fleet pirates—all at the same time, with no one batting an eye. There's no faction reputation system that makes your choices feel like they matter. This completely breaks the immersion and makes the galaxy feel like a theme park, where you can ride every ride without any repercussions. I would prefer they took Fallout 4's faction implementation over what we have now.

Shattered Space DLC is mediocre. Why make being a member of House Varuun mandatory? They should have made it optional. The questline and story are interesting, revealing some mysteries, but it's not enough. Only played the DLC for the achievement and never touched it again.

NG+ gives players another avenue of choices without starting a new character every time, which is a huge plus for me.

Starfield,1716740,201683928,"I’m giving Starfield an 8/10 as it is a good game, but not GOTY.  It’s similar to Elder Scrolls or Fallout except it is focused on space travel and exploration.  It does a lot of things well, and others leave you scratching your head as to why the developers implemented some mechanics the way they did.

My main complaint is that space ships are controlled using a mouse and keyboard or a console style controller.  There is no native joystick/HOTAS support.  Some folks defend this oversight by stating Starfield is not a space sim, yet a good deal of your time will be spent in your ship flying around and fighting “in space”.  I hope to see joystick support added in a future patch (hint, hint).

The main storyline has you unraveling a mystery that takes you all over the known galaxy in which there are 120-star systems and 1700 planets to visit.   Several of the systems are colonized and controlled by different factions; some friendly and of course many systems are controlled by outlaws and pirates.  You can jump to the different systems using your Grav drive then scan the planets and moons to see their topographical layout including different regional biomes.  Biomes support different flora (plants), fauna (life forms), and resources.  You may have to travel to several different biomes to scan an entire planet.  Scanned planet and system data can be turned in to different NPCs or sold for credits to vendors.

Different planets and moons will have various gravity, atmosphere, and points of Interest (POI).  Some of the POIs are mission related and others are randomly generated for you to go scan or explore.  (They are kind of like camps and dungeons in other Bethesda games.)  During the games initial release, you had to walk/run from your ship to these scattered POIs.  Now there are vehicles you can use to drive or fly to get there faster.

There is the main story line, faction missions, activity missions, miscellaneous and random missions that just pop up.  Bethesda implemented random “radiant” quests (called missions here) in previous games.  For instance, you can pop into a system and a researcher may hail you and ask if you have any resources they can trade for.  You could find a ship on a planet and the pilot is working on it because it broke down causing them to make a forced landing.  There are also mission boards you can visit to pick up various random missions.  So, there is always something to do.

The voice acting is well done and NPC facial animations express emotion which helps with immersion.   As with other Bethesda titles, there are NPCs that mill around and travel from place to place, and static NPCs that are vendors and related to the many available missions.

The ground combat AI is “OK” as NPCs will take cover, step out from cover to shoot at you, and throw grenades.  But, depending on how realistic you like things, it could be considered too easy.  For instance, NPCs in installations will fight you until they are dead, but since they never set off an alarm, none of the other NPCs in the same installation will come to their aid.  Also, the sneak mechanic is kind of broken as all you have to do is wait a while and the NPCs figure you have run off and they will then go back to what they were doing, even walking past their dead companions lying on the ground.  There are several AI mods that improve NPC combat that makes it much more challenging.

Ship space combat is also just OK.  Ships warp in and you’ll be engaged in battle in which you can either just shoot through their shields and hull to destroy them, or lock onto a single ship, then select from different sub systems such as weapons, shields, engines, or Grav drive to take out individually.  Taking out a ships Grav drive prevents it from escaping, while taking out their engines lets you dock and board the ship.  Once inside you can kill the crew and take over the ship, adding it to your fleet.

There are a lot of different weapon types to choose from including sniper rifles, shotguns, pistols, grenade launchers, miniguns, and melee weapons.  You can improve weapons and suits at crafting benches (after unlocking the appropriate skills) and some weapons and suits come with special perks such as increasing weapon fire rate, or a suits protection against energy weapons.

There are various crafting skills and benches.  You can craft basic items, but will need to spend skill points into the crafting skills in order to make better quality weapon and suits.

Ship building is modular.  There are 3 classes of ships, based on reactor size, and you can buy, sell, build and modify to your hearts content.  Mostly.  There is a cap of 10 ships you can own.

The skill system is vast, with 5 different area covering personal improvement, research, combat, exploration, and ship systems.  Unfortunately, there are way more skills than you will ever have enough skill points to unlock unless you get to level 300 or so.  So, you have several choices… decide on a limited “build” that you put those precious points into, leaving you unable to do other things, use a mod to increase the number of skill points gained per level (I find 3 per level is about right), or use the console command to give yourself points or skills.  Many will say the last two options are cheats, and rightfully so, but I play games for enjoyment not frustration.

You can build outposts on planets and moons, place various HABs (habitat enclosures), resource extractors, and outpost defenses.  Outposts are similar to settlements in Fallout.  This is where you can collect raw materials for crafting or create a home out among the stars.

Completing the main storyline can create quite a dilemma for you as it offers some (game) life altering choices.  I’m not going to add spoilers, so if you want to know, go do an online search for it or just play though the game. 

As with other Bethesda games, StarField is better with mods.  You can find good ones, both free and paid ones, in the in game Creations section.  There are also a lot at Starfield Nexus.  I run about 175 mods that actually make the game harder (more realistic) than cheaty.  For instance, NO fast travel, Medkits, digipicks and ammo all have weight instead of 0.00, food doesn't provide instant healing but crafted food provides better buffs than packaged foods, Grav jumps require Real Fuel (Helium-3).  There are some that give you an edge like extracting and installing mods on guns and weapons.  But, again, that is something you would expect could and should exist.  

TLDR;  Vanilla Starfield is an 8/10.  With mods, it easily becomes 9.9/10 (still needs joystick support) and one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played, including Skyrim.

PS.. I noticed a little star that says my review is not considered in the overall Positive/Negative survey count because I activated StarField with a Steam Key.  That is BS.

This is a Bethesda game, so if you've played other Bethesda games (Skyrim, Fallout 4, etc.), you'll have a rough idea of what to expect.

But this is a game set in space. Space is a yawning black void of seemingly infinite nothingness, and Bethesda have accurately captured this ambience by making it more boring than a party political broadcast from Gordon Boring, Minister of Boring, from the Boring Party.

I've spent huge chunks of my adult life scampering through Skyrim's frosty environs and throwing small nuclear bombs at people in Fallout's Commonwealth. I love nothing more than a good Bethesda open-world explorathon, but this game... Dear Lord, what were they thinking?!

Initially, I was enthused. I was anticipating great things. I was prepared to be gobsmacked. And because I'm an easily-impressed simpleton at the best of times, I kept waiting for interesting stuff to happen. For those ""Ooooh! What's in here?"" moments you expect from a Bethesda game. Instead I spent a lot of time wandering around like a confused pensioner, wondering what I was supposed to do next, cursing the horrible user interface, and hoping something cool would be over the next ridge. Or the one after that. Or the one after that. But there was never anything cool. Just another vast expanse of AI-generated slop with the same copy/paste factory, or cave, or mining outpost, populated by the same generic ""bad men with guns"" or ""helpless colonists"" or ""angry robots"".

Starfield is a game that makes you wish you were playing something other than Starfield. Sometimes I'd get so bored I'd get up and do household chores rather than keep playing. I have a pathological hatred of household chores, but given the choice, I'd go do laundry or vacuum the stairwell than spend another hour shuffling despondently across a dreary, rock-strewn plateau waiting for some guy in a spacesuit to start shooting at me for the 57th time. (Or I'd just play Fallout 4 instead.)

It's not all bad. The main quest, though slow to start, is pretty engaging once it gathers momentum. Likewise, the faction and major side quests. The game certainly looks nice. It's stuffed to the gunnels with the usual Bethesda jank -- NPCs getting stuck on the scenery, inanimate objects rocketing around the room because the physics system has imploded, and occasionally you'll exit your ship only to load in trapped beneath the boarding ramp, fast travel being your only means of escape. The voice actors all put in a solid performance, the combat mechanics are by no means revolutionary, but they're at least as good as Fallout 4, and the music's suitably pleasant. It's when you wander off the beaten path and look for extraneous things to do that it all falls sideways over a cliff. And for a Bethesda game, this is the kiss of death.

Bethesda nerds play Bethesda games because we love the freedom to go wherever we want, whenever we want, and do pretty much whatever we want when we get there. Both Skyrim and Fallout 4 gave us a hand-crafted world, densely packed with hand-crafted locations, full of interesting characters or at the very least, some environmental story-telling. NPCs, notes, computer log entries, they all worked together to give us a sense of these locations being actual places, existing for actual reasons, and within them we were given meaningful things to do. (Radiant quests have always been a nice idea in theory, but considerably less engaging in practice, so let's not talk about those right now.)

Starfield gives you endless torrents of procedurally-generated dog-water to wade through, and almost all of it is mind-numbingly dull. I get that space is like, really big and stuff, and hand-crafting entire solar systems would likely mean the game wouldn't have a release date before the year 2058, but some kind of compromise would have been nice. Maybe if Bethesda had reined in the ambition a little bit, choosing instead to work on a smaller, more curated experience.

Seriously, is anyone really interested in 500 planets if they know 450 of them have been crapped out by Chat-GPT? This stuff was boring back when the first Mass Effect game was released. Driving the Mako (which handled as though it was made of balsa wood and helium) around the surface of Generic Planet #839 in search of Salarian relics was utterly monotonous, and Starfield's rendition of the same repetitive nonsense is just as insufferable. Please don't make me pilot a vehicle that is possessed by demons across interminable miles of nothing. It's the opposite of fun and it will make me hate your game. (And if you make me walk, I will place a curse upon your entire bloodline lasting until the heat-death of the universe.)

But, but, but... space battles?! Space travel boils down to ""clickety-clickety-clickety-WOOSH!"", and interstellar combat is basically, ""Oh no! Pirates!"", followed by roughly three minutes of ""shooty-shooty-blam-blam-BOOM!"" Then, because you need to use your grav-drive to jump to another star system, it's more ""clickety-clickety-clickety-WOOSH!"" However, if you need to land on the planet, it's a variation of ""clickety-clickety-clickety-WOOSH!"", followed by a brief cutscene, after which you wander aimlessly like a clinically-depressed homeless person across a boring landscape (it might be verdant green, or cobalt blue, or soiled-undergarments brown, but it's always boring), then you have a chat with someone deeply forgettable, briefly participate in some anticlimactic ""pew-pew-pew!"", then ""clickety-clickety-clickety-WOOSH!"" back to the cold, uncaring vacuum of space. Rinse and repeat until you can feel your soul actively trying to escape your body.

I so wanted this game to be good. But it's not. It's a steaming wheelbarrow-load of wasted potential. Bethesda are better than this. Buy it if it's on sale, and only if the discount is seriously hefty. Otherwise, there are far better ways to waste the remaining sad, purposeless moments of your sorry existence. Try vacuuming the stairwell. It's loads of fun. Honest.

Starfield,1716740,201667173,"So I've got a 80 hours in the ship builder and maybe the other 30 in actual gameplay, even less for main/side quests. I used the console to get cash to build ships, fight me. 

It's boring & having a loading screen between planets & no in atmo flight makes pretty much everything I've done in the ship builder feel like a complete waste of time. No challenge from the AI ships after a point, heck I don't even know if there ever really was. It's not like they can really evade or pop countermeasures. 

The reason I ended up using the console to get cash vs. playing the game is because the story content is so unbelievably boring that even when the game tried to convey real stakes to me by making me pick a character to let die, I almost skipped past the option, that's how checked out I already was. 

I don't know what bethesda expected to happen here, & what's worse is that the nasa-punk style of everything is actually very cool in my opinion. This is one of the main reasons I like films like Sunshine or Interstellar over something like star wars; it's raw & analog feeling making the tech feel realistic. 

Bethesda needs to adopt a new design philosophy & really start taking some risks. Allow players to do things that change their play throughs in meaningful ways. Let us screw up, don't give us a paper choice so we don't risk missing something. Handholding players is only going to turn people off in my experience, see Destiny 2 for example. 

Who even plays that game besides streamers these days? That game is only interesting when playing non-matchmade content, otherwise it actually puts me to sleep with how easy & simplistic everything is.  

Their excuse is the same as bethesda's; they favor the engine they know. 

Well, it's time to make a change particularly around the AI in these games, the grunts in Halo have more survival instincts than the empty headed lot in Starfield. Seriously, at least the grunts know to kill themselves (and the player in the process) when the chips are down.

There was a time where Bethesda had minimal to no competition, however these days the only things that really set them apart is the scope & scale of their worlds. You can still pick up almost every item & walk until you pretty much can't anymore.  

However, that exploration is extremely hollow in starfield; outside of a few trash mobs & a structure or two there really isn't anything meaningful to find on those planets aside from a couple of good views.

I still come back every once in a while to tinker with a ship or walk around the moon, earth whatever feels cool & yet after a few minutes I'm like ""why am I playing this?"" & simply uninstall the game. 

Do not ever pay full price for this game, plenty of better games exist at much lower price points. If you want to try it; get game pass like I should have.

This is game is pretty much ""promises"" and ""potential"" but it's all mediocre or simply feature incomplete. 

First off the RPG elements in this game are atrocious. I will give an example :

I was sent to recover a pilot and a ship from Eclipse merc's. Upon docking to the ship I persuaded the merc leader to let go off the pilot which he did agreed on. NOW here's where the RPG falls apart. I had a choice to shoot them after freeing the pilot but I was outnumbered and didn't have good guns... so I thought to myself I can just blast their ship and take remains of the cargo ! NOPE. The ship is a PROTECTED NPC. That's right the game has NPC's you CAN'T KILL because of ""story"" reasons smh. 

Sadly there is WAY more immersion breaking ""choices"" that can't be made or simply the game won't let you play as the bad guy. 

The COMPANIONS you get are all bad. I miss my old crew from Mass Effect 2. They had style, personality and quest lines. Whereas companions you get in starfield are... just bland. Boring and annoying. 

Space exploration is pretty much - LOADING SCREENS with occasional space battles. Even then the controls are clunky ( it's like the Dev's never played Ever Space 2 ? ).

In the future all NPC civilians will be fat, ugly and have a plastic surgery on their face. Seriously person who designed them should be ashamed. 

Combat is servicable BUT STEALTH is broken! Enemies can see you through walls, your companions can trigger the combat ( at least the big robot buddy got me in trouble way too many times! ) and Perk tree requires some dumb challenges to complete?! WHY? I still have to put a PERK POINT IN IT so WHY SHOULD I DO DUMB CHALLENGES ? 

There is severe lack of tension and horror in the game about the SPACE... they really dropped the ball here. Bland fetch quests aside from few and back to loading screens. 

There is more to say but I don't want to end in the negative note...

I enjoyed the spaceship design, fantastic armour and weapon designs and overall aesthetic of indoor and outdoor locations is great. 

The game has it's moments but that's about it. It never gets EPIC like Mass Effect... never reaches it's potential... it's such a waste. Buy it on 75% sale...


EDIT 1 : Writing and choices are atrocious ! I could never roleplay as a badass Renegade ( like Shepherd from ME 2 ). Joined Crimson Fleet pirates only to be disrespected constantly, underpaid and had no WAY TO SHOOT them because of protected NPC and Questlines. Screw this. I can't even talk back or refuse to do certain things because THERE IS NO OTHER OPTIONS. Bethesda didn't code it. 

Also WHY oh WHY most people IMPORTANT NPC's are FEMALE? Seriously. CEO's, security, army operatives... you name it. Whereas white males often are often presented as goofy and incompetent.

There's a memorable instance where you can betray a faction but the NPC's are invincible so that quest line if you choose the bad route is basically unplayable. There are several invincible NPC's. If you choose bad choices you're companions will all hate that. There is no grey or evil morality support in the game. If you make bad choices your companions WILL find out even if they weren't with you when you did evil. The auto generated content is so boring. Sure there are hundreds of planets but only a hand full with prefabs that are actually interesting to explore. You can explore planets with nothing on them for hours and its just generally boring. Even building out a settlement for resources is not interesting. 

The one pro I will grant Starfield for all its lack of content at least its a functional game. This may be Bethesda's most functional game with the least amount of bugs. There are a few game mechanics that really feel it's the most elevated compared to other Bethesda games. If you like Bethesda games you might enjoy this game initially.

Regardless, for most players, it'll probably take a while before you get bored of exploration.

The game has New Game+. I don't usually take advantage of NG+, because I have only a limited amount of time, and few games deserve my time for a replay.

Yes, not everyone is going to feel that need, but for me, it was compelling enough that I started NG+. The issue with this, of course, is that your dozens of hours of settling in the world go down the drain, and you start all over again. It makes getting attached to anything harder than it should be. I can appreciate the writing, but what it means for the game is that the whole game becomes hollow. It's like pulling the rug after you've completed the game.

- Scouring every nook and cranny looking for loot to grab and probably sell is really great and the interior environments are all incredibly well detailed.

- The actual asset detail is incredible, I know a lot of people talk shit about the graphics and I will name a few complaints in the cons, but overall most of the assets and interior environments actually look really good (too many people just play with brightness cranked so high everything is washed out)
- I might be in the minority, but I really do like the progression system. Mostly because it's like fallout and Skyrim progression had a baby. I never loved Fallout's because every perk had some kind of perk point prerequisite which became a time sync to grind levels, and I never loved Skyrim's for the same reason but different. In Skyrim it became a time sync where you basically were required to cheese a skill level just to get some decent perks. I like Starfield's because rather than a specific skill level to unlock a perk, you have a specific objective. I like that. I understand that might be an unpopular opinion, but I like having to ""unlock"" my perks with an objective rather than just points.

Cons
- The menus... the menus... the menus... there are soooooo many menus you have to go through and click on just to travel from one planet, to another, and then from that planet another menu to land on the surface. It's just 5 too many clicks in my opinion and really kills any solid grind sesh that requires moving around a lot of different planets.
- The UI to this day (8/4/2025) is locked at 30fps and that really sucks
- The graphics are great mostly, BUUUUT, the graphics on exterior environments such as the proceduarlly generated landscape on most planets suuuuuck graphically. Apart from showcase landscapes such as the very first one you travel to in game, they are all extremely repetitive and the foliage can appear kind of muddy (not brown but like blurry)

Middle Ground
- The loading screens going in and out of buildings don't actually bother me that much. I have an m.2 so they load extremely fast though obviously it'd be better if I could just open a door and boom, I'm there. It's just not as encumbering as the Skyrim or Fallout 4 days. The only loading screen problem I have is what I mentioned in the cons about how many menus you have to click through to get from one planet to another. 

Overall I really loved playing Starfield, beat it a couple times before I burned out because of all of the fast travel sub-menus for simple travel.

Starfield,1716740,201457153,"[h1]Bethesda Gave Me the Stars… Then took away the sky [/h1]

I was walking in New Atlantis, just there wandering, alone, thinking about how this city looks big but feels small at the same time, that's where I stumbled upon it, 'TerraBrew' i went there, maybe to get some latte or just black coffee with no sugar, the employees were arguing with someone, so i thought I'd help myself, went to one of the tables, and took a sip from the latte left there, the next thing i knew is UC security all over the place, weapons all drawn at me, and they telling me that i am under arrest, I thought okay, maybe I'd pay a fine or get a lawyer or something, but nooooo. Blackout, i wake up in jail, somewhere in space, and Commander Ikande is there telling me that I have the qualifications to work for space government (i really wish getting a job in real life was this easy) and infiltrate the Crimson fleet as a spy. This where I realized that Bethesda don't make games, they make fever dreams with budget.
And that's basically Starfield, a Space RPG in space, where logic is optional and your ship is real but your freedom is mostly a 'Suggestion'.

You see a planet there, you like it? you think am gonna fly there and live the space exploration dream, Nope, you basically open a menu, go to map, then get out of planet click again to get out of system, click on that system to enter, click on that planet to travel to, and maybe you start to think this is it... but again nope... loading screen appears. you reach that planet and now times to land and yes you guessed it again, open that google map thing and click where to land and again loading SCREEN, you think OK at least i will fly inside the planet exploring and all, but again no, you only land and walk from there, and even if you want to change the spot you landed at, you again open map and click on different spot and land, A PROCESS THAT KILLS THE IMMERSION!!!! OF YOUR EXPERIENCE.
 It feels like if i gave you a Lamborghini car, you set there very happy, can't believe yourself. Now let's have a ride, but nope the steering wheel is locked instead am gonna show you [b]A POWERPOINT SLIDESHOW OF YOUR DREAMS BEING SHATTERED!.[/b] They build an entire galaxy then taped a fast travel system to it, and called it immersive, it's a very disappointing experience that has zero seamless space to planet flighting, it completely ruins the space exploration experience and every time you get that excitement feeling it just gets shutdown by that process.

Now to be fair there's always the bad and good, and Oh boy, this game makes up for those dream shattering moments in some way.

[h3]SHIP BUILDING:[/h3]
This is the best thing in the game, it feels like Lego but for adults with interior design trauma, you want to build a war machine?? yeah you can. you would like a comfy mobile home? or maybe an IKEA showroom that you can decorate and make it yours, yes you can do all that(You can even put a toilet with toilet paper in the cockpit, for some reason). this is something I've put many hours into and every time i feel to do more and more building non stop, it's therapy.

[h3]World details:[/h3]
I’ve never seen a game in my life that is this detailed. Bethesda’s art team went feral, every single item, sandwich, object, every lab or deserted outpost there are details everywhere, in every corner around the galaxy. I think someone personally hand placed them during a 3 AM breakdown. i am amazed, Many times I would just walk around, staring at objects like a creep, because the level of detail is insane. you can tell someone’s soul went into decorating these spaces. Heck, there’s more storytelling in an open closet or lab than in the story itself. BUT.... then you leave those handcrafted areas and land on a random moon or a planet, and the magic is just gone, yes there are breathtaking views and very cool alien skies, but the details are gone, it's just an empty copy pasted layout on every planet to the point where exploring becomes very boring and has no value, i do understand that this is what space in reality would look like, empty and vast but still, we need something to keep the player engaged, not to find abandoned facility with the same layout on all moons and planets.

[h3]Story:[/h3]
yeah the main story is there, you touch some rock, see a vision, float a bit, tbh i didn't care, it felt as if they were trying to be deep and mysterious, but to me it felt shallow and forgettable, However...all the real magic went into the side quest, especially the faction storylines, those are where the game comes alive, I've enjoyed all of them, they'er not top tier, but they are solid enough to keep you engaged and interested.

[h3]Companions:[/h3]
I was never this disappointed with this kind of companions. It was a disastrous experience. They don’t feel like your companions, they feel like some company HR interns but in space. you commit a very tiny mistake and they’re like, “I don’t think that aligns with our mission values” Especially Sarah Morgan. I HATE YOU.
Sometimes they feel very dumb. for example, Andreja will keep asking me, “Can we talk for a moment?” while I am engaging in combat and fighting for my life, and it happened not one time or two, but many times, at the end i just preferred to travel alone with no companions.

[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]
I'd say it's okay, typical Bethesda gameplay, I did really enjoy the guns in this game, the combat and shooting mechanics where okay i guess, also the ship battles where fun sometimes, the most fun time i had is when i hijacked others ship and enter them and steal the ship and kill all it's crew. also there are many guns in this game, i loved them, they are detailed, you can customize them, put a silencer, but for nothing since the stealth in this game is garbage. 

[h3]Photomode:[/h3]
I am really amazed here. While nothing particularly special, the game is damn pretty that you could accidentally create a masterpiece. there’s so much to capture, alien moons, space sunsets, giant gas planets, it’s a straight desktop wallpaper factory, the depth of field is also really good in this game.

finally i would rate this game a 6/10 for building a dream world and hold it all together with loading screens, 10/10 for ship building alone, maybe 8/10 for that coffee theft to spy career shift, AND -999 FOR PRETENDING FAST TRAVEL IS THE SAME AS FLYING!!!

Dear Bethesda,
You made something huge. Something packed with tons of details, art, ambition, and almost feels handcrafted (the planets are not though). But then you sat me down and said:
“You see that planet? You can’t actually go there. But here’s a loading screen.”

You gave me a spaceship and told me I could explore the stars...
Then made me teleport every single time and open that damn Google Maps in space.

You handed me the keys to a galaxy,
and then locked the steering wheel.

WHY?

We didn’t want loading screens.
We wanted to feel control.
I wanted to feel the journey.
To live like the real thing.

I would say only buy this game if you really enjoy space, or you are just like me who like to stare maybe for long times, at objects, views, spaceship interior, or love to take screenshots, because photomode is decent. it's not worth full price unless you truly understand what you are getting. tbh there's much more to talk about but i feel this is enough for now.",True,152,7639

Starfield,1716740,201437809,"Leading up to this game releasing I was excited. I want to enjoy this game. The game is full of elements that I do enjoy. Space Exploration, ship and outpost building. The game launched with no shortage of bugs. One of the first things Bethesda 'fixed' was the ship service merchant chest in New Atlantis. Probably wouldnt be an issue if a similar bug didnt still exist in Skyrim to this day. More recently, Bethesda 'fixed' the player ability to reroll stats on the Mantis suit. Both of these bugs are generally harmless in a single player game. Meanwhile, theres still a bug in the game that causes Temples to not spawn. This is a core mechanic of the game that still hasnt been fixed and can be considered game-breaking. The list goes on and on. The game feels like a lot of potential and broken promises. Despite buying it on sale, I kinda feel like I want to return the game and get a refund. Ps. Lets not overlook the paid mods! Basically anything is permissible IF you pay for it, achievements arent disabled. IF you run a free mod that does the same thing the achievements are disabled.

Is it perfect? Of course not - it's ultimately a Bethesda creation engine game, which comes with loads of positive as well as loads of negatives. However, anyone who is familiar with the engine and their other games will feel right at home.

The game has loads of difficulty options which can be tweaked to your liking in a granular way, including things like carry capacity, how much money vendors have, damage done and taken, etc. You can pretty much tailor the difficulty to your liking and make it as hard or as easy as you desire.

The story is fine - the factions are fun and the world itself has enough going for it to keep you busy for many hours. The NG+ mechanics, without spoiling anything, enable multiple play-throughs and add something new during those.

Ship customisation is great, outpost building I haven't interacted with but seems to have some depth to it too.

But honestly, the most important thing for me: The game is *fun*. I feel people forget that this is what games are about and criticise games for graphics, animations or gameplay aspects whilst praising games which have far less depth or are just not anywhere near as much fun to play.

Can't fit it in your inventory, and your ship also has an inventory restriction, so that's just dandy.

And like those earlier legendary titles, Starfield is still fairly early in its development cycle, with only one DLC so far released, and the modding community only just getting involved. 

Starfield game reviews have also somewhat tracked those earlier titles. Fallout New Vegas, for example was initially panned--but is now a fan favorite, considered by some (myself included) to be one of their best ever titles.  

Does Starfield have bugs? Quirky and/or maddening mechanics? Yes, and yes. But so does EVERY other Bethesda title I love, especially Skyrim and FO4. Misleading and/or incorrect quest markers, and the Ship Builder interface are the chief culprits plaguing Starfield. Until either the Devs--or the modding community--sort them out, they'll continue to be the biggest downside to the game. To be fair, putting the time in to learn exactly how these quirky features work has made them much, much more manageable.

Starfield is a great exploration, Sci-fi sandbox looter shooter universe that gives you a PLETHORA of not just quests, but each type of quest, ranging from scientific exploration and pioneering to killing some dude or ship for money, to stealth missions requiring the utmost control of your fingers and awareness. It has SO much to offer in the realm of roleplay and really lets you piecemeal your charterer together and flesh out your own story and some cool adventures. creations is just mods with a price tag and I will say that to my dying days but does add some things that fit the themes of starfield. Bethesda has a massive community and most of them geek out about the stories that are placed before them, starfield, despite is MASSIVE short comings is still a great story. Shortcomings? yes, they are glaring and massive, for a supposed ERA DEFINING title, its weaksauce compared to already massive Sci-Fi game titles out there and the reasoning? bugs and gamebreaking problems, NOT a feature just to say. People across the board have issues or take issue with TONS of bugs, such as getting locked into NPC convos, quest triggers getting stuck, game crashing after random high visual intensity scenes or just outright hardlocking after your to good at the game randomly have a quest item you shouldnt have yet. these are just a few examples. Its like one of the devs spilled some soda into the code and its just sticking the keys together and attracting more bugs.

I will continue to forge ahead and maybe try what the community recommends and get 3rd party fixes (IE: dlss mod or optomizations).

A horribly mixed bag with some elements (like space) looking beautiful with others (the NPCs in cities) looking terrible. Map design and exploration? Cities are just as small as ever and the world feels empty and devoid of reasons to explore. Everything is procedural generation and I found ONE interesting quest on a random planet.

Starfield,1716740,201198490,"I wrote a several pages long review for myself; this is the absolute barebones version.

--This is - not - a space exploration game. That notion is false. YouTubers and many reviewers refuse to acknowledge this fact. They promoted the game the wrong way. Starfield is (just) a single-player, open-world game in which you happen to use a ship to get to your quest destination - that’s it.

--Like several other open-world games, Starfield severely limits your XP, credits, and possibly rare resource intake (forcing you into New Game+). Much like AC: Valhalla (even with everything boosted to +75%) your XP gain is abysmal. This is done very deliberately.

--The XP crafting guides on YouTube from a year ago are now heavily nerfed and no longer work.
I crafted countless ""Red Trench"", for example, to gain XP instead (and used console commands to acquire the materials).

Killing certain enemies or animals still grants good XP, and there are XP farming guides out there.
However, 90% of quests give very little XP - you're basically doing them for the story.
Don’t expect amazing weapon rewards either as it should’ve been. (with maybe one or two exceptions) 

--If you do not want, or like, to play with mods, I absolutely cannot recommend this game.

(Real effort and expertise, have ensured that you don't gain progess at, what is in my view, an acceptable rate.)

--I focus on the story, conversations, gameplay, and missions. 
If you lack the patience to read or absorb what you're doing, and just want to casually play, skip this one.

--I was in full rebel mode, determined to deliver a positive review for about 80% of the game - I loved it.
Not having to deal with credits, carry weight, XP, or resources, and just doing the cool stuff like building your own starship, becoming a pirate, saving the government, exposing corruption, and engaging in corporate espionage.

--My will to continue however dropped sharply near the end, when I started the main questline.
At its core, it's an ad infinitum rat race. They lead you toward something divine, but you're really just confronted with hubris. Calling this lackluster is an understatement. Starfield is a game that demands - or funnels you toward - replaying it. (Again & again.)

--The main quests give you 'starborn' powers. A handful are somewhat useful but certainly not needed. 
And to reach the max rank (10) legitimately of each individual power (24 in total), you need to replay the main story ten times... Yeah, that's never going to happen.

(So basically every time you replay the game, you can add 1 point to an existing power, up to 10. - more range, dmg, lower cooldown, etc.)

--In most single-player games, people wish for New Game+. 
This is, no joke, the first game I’ve ever encountered where you actively don’t want it.
Worst of all: you can't take your very carefully crafted ship, weapons, or armor with you.

All my weapons and spacesuits are custom crafted with handpicked perks.
--Some complain about ""bullet sponge"" enemies - that's false.

What they should say is that your talents (and thus your XP gains) 
- not just weapons, or their perks - mostly determine your damage output.

You’ll deal very high damage with:
- Semi-auto, silenced weapons
- Always being crouched/invisible (to initiate sneak attacks)
- Talents like Stealth, Concealment, Sharpshooting, Armor Penetration, and Marksmanship

The problem? Crouch-walking speed is horrendously slow, so legit players avoid stealth entirely and just use Mag or Va'ruun weapons. (I used a mod to increase crouch-walk speed to stay mobile in combat.)

With this setup, nearly everything dies instantly - even from an advanced, silenced, old earth, 1911 pistol or a silenced (Hard Target) sniper for example. The rest is gravy.

Semi auto weapons, burst included, gain more crit chance and this, with crit damage talents, deal most of your damage when multiplied by 5x through sneak attacks.

Very basic, but requires around... level 130 to have a comfortable amount of talents to enjoy the game on Extreme, with a variety of weapons, and all necessary ship talents, etc.

Alternatively, the Va'ruun Inflictor and (DLC) Longfang are also top-tier, even without legendary effects. (Sneak attacks still reign supreme though.)
An Inflictor with One Inch Punch is roughly equal to a non-perked, advanced Longfang.
They clearly made them very strong to incentivize DLC purchases - a common tactic nowadays.

--Most companions are useless (you’re much stronger with the Isolation talent) and constantly judge your every move. If there was an option to throw Sarah out the airlock, I’d have done it.
Gamers don’t play to be berated like children - and the conversation options to stand up for yourself are extremely weak.

Basically, you’ll get a ton of condescending feedback, and while I have thick skin, the fact that you are treated like a petulant child ripe for scolding - is where I draw the line.

Jessamine is probably my favorite, she's down for whatever, but she has weak ship talents and can’t be romanced. Sam Coe is voiced by the legendary Elias Toufexis (Deus Ex: HR/MD), which was a real highlight.

There’s also a Russian character - name, voice, accent - who doesn’t look Russian at all. (I’m sure you understand what I mean.) It’s blatantly obvious that an outside force came in very late during development and decided certain quotas hadn’t been met.

Why I'm not giving a negative review:
*As someone who enjoys single-player, open-world games, Starfield is not without merit.
200 hours for a single player game, while bypassing almost all the timegating nonsense is good value in my book.

*I grew up playing the original RollerCoaster Tycoon, so building was one of my earliest gaming joys.
In Starfield, you can build your own outposts and ships - and there’s nothing else quite like it. (That I know of.)

*I really like the music.

*I’m not very familiar with earlier Bethesda games. (They did publish Dishonored 1 & 2, but that’s about it.)

Valid criticism:
* The eyes look horrendous. It's so horribly done, I just look at the subtitles. 
There're mods that fix this but I don't want to install too many on my potato PC.

I read a comment that said, very roughly:
""You walk through a museum detailing the history of the Settled Systems and a major galactic war - yet the planets you visit are barren and lifeless.""

That’s exactly it. In an ideal world, Bethesda would’ve scrapped the main story and all the Starborn nonsense (which started off intriguing, until you actually meet them and realize the 'divine' endgame is just a repetitive rat race).

Instead, they could’ve focused on you being a simple grunt in a brutal war with mechs and xenos, fighting against impossible odds! 

Or even make two games in one: in which you choose between the UC or the Freestar Collective, with entirely different stories depending on your choice. (make a real new game + experience.)

In short, they could’ve gone in dozens of better directions - none of which involved chasing artifacts for no apparent reason, just to gain more powers you don’t even need.

All in all, I'm at 180 hours in now, nearing the end - with mods. 
Without mods, it could easily be double this, just for 1 full playthrough.
There's value here. 

Best of luck!

Mods I used:
- Zero Weight 
- Richer vendors (x10)
- Stealth Run
- Minimum Level 100 (to keep enemies at 100% your level)
- Varuun X (for black, hooded clothing.)
- Console commands for resources, and to add specific weapon & armor perks.

I had a great time playing this game, exploring, battles, weapons, space armor, building outposts and spaceships etc. Huge open world game, like very huge. Been a while since I played(I bought expansion and started playing again), I see they fixed many bugs and they added cars to explore planets! Great.
Not many games where I can play 4+ hours straight without getting the slightest bored, really impressive, lol. This game is great for anyone that likes singleplayer open world games(and in this case space/the universe too). I very much recommend it, if you like that. 

Now, I primarily mention some bad game designs/lacking QoL(quality of life), because most of the game is great, easier to mention the bad things:
- You cannot stash minerals/ores/stuff and access it everywhere, except in your spaceship with limited space. This is so annoying, like really QoL bad design. You have to move materials and such around all the time and it sucks, until your ships cargo hold is huge. Storage system makes outpost building(which I guess the game was meant to be about, observing all the outpost talents etc., but then again not really with the NG+ system, losing everything anyway etc.). You MUST have a ship with large cargo hold, making the spaceship fighting pretty bad, then you must change your ship to a battleship etc. and I do not really trust the game to keep my stuff in my spaceship either, if I change ship etc.
- Mining, why spend time farming ores on planets, when I can just buy them in stores cheap? If they had to actually give you the feeling, that you must collect ressources, they should probably not add vendors selling them for nothing? Either selling them for very high prices or not at all(hard to get items), and allowing the player to sell them too for decent money? With this design the ressource mining and scanning planets is totally pointless? Only thing you really need is aluminium, iron and some lead, copper. Had been better imo, if you actually had to mine the stuff yourself on different planets, and then some really rare ores on planets that are hard to survive on(""extreme enviroment"" - reason to get this skill too btw), large carnivores, heat, acid etc.? And what is the point in building the outpost extractions, when you can just buy ressources, surely you need an outpost to farm alu, iron, titanium and lead(most used materials). It's an open world RPG exploration game right? The planets, their ressources and building outposts were supposed to be big? The idea imo should be, that you must mine to build and craft gear? Would had made more sense, reason to explore and do these things, reason to pick certain skills? The mining missions/objectives would also make more sense, ""outpost business"". 
 - The gear/item menu etc. is pretty bad to navigate in? Is there even a way to see if some item is an upgrade for my companion? As I see it, if you stay and play in just normal game, I guess companions and  leadership works, but if you rush NG+ you would go for isolation trait - because you don't need to pick up a thing other than weapons and ammo. Strange designs imo, as if the game goes against it's own game genre, it's own skill designs, all the ""sidestuff"" in their game? I mean RPG is about collecting stuff, finding stuff, play your way. There is no way to search for an item either. And we have like thousands of items around in different places due to not having one chest where we can store everything. I think it's fair to ask why there are so many items, if you take ""aid"", there are several items with almost the same effect etc.? Different food is great for designing the outpost etc.(only looks). The game is also very easy due to pretty op aid items? Boost in damage, resistances, speed etc. 
- Outpost building, the ""connecting stuff""(cargo link) is quite hard to navigate/master, quite poor design? Outposts can be quite bugged too, sometimes you can load and some parts of the outpost is gone, then go somewhere else and come back and the stuff is back, plants sometimes bugs into the inside of your outpost(still there). Then gone again later on. Pretty annoying when the idea in the game is about building outposts. I made my own outpost mansion/palace, great ""Hollywood view"" from a mountain, really put some hours into it. I had lots of fun building/designing my main outpost, think I spend 50 + hours or so lol(I also enjoyed building in Fallout etc.), putting all my collected items on display, designing my outpost etc. I like building stuff in games. Also no option to build some ""universal"" chest that regardless of outpost and place could allow us to store stuff with unlimited space(outpost linked chest)? QoL stuff, why not? It's a singleplayer game? Not even some option in talent points. The storage system is so annoying, Jesus. 
- I also wish the dev's had made half as many planets and then focused on making them better instead of making many ""poor""/fill designed planets without much purpose, Fewer planets with increased design quality, rather than quantity(a bit like the 8,2 billion humans on Planet Earth, hehe)? 
- New game plus - it annoys me, that I lose everything in new game plus? I lose my 50 + hours designed outposts, my designed ship!? I can understand the logic/idea in it, but then in start tell me this?(It's hard to reach level 100 without NG+? Even though sources on the internet asserts it's possible. Would be nice, if there was an option to lock one outpost and one spaceship into new game plus at least? Please tell me this design in start, character creation screen? - So I can wait for second or third playthrough to spend 50 + hours building my stuff, collecting items from planets?  I spend a lot of time making a really nice outpost and now my ship. Losing it? Why? Losing 50+ hours of my life? It's a game. I personally didn't use the powers much(except expansion now)? The game is pretty easy already? Yet the new game plus stuff is based around getting power ups, as far as I can tell? You become like some ""quantum god being"" or something. So I tried NG+(to reach level 100), enemies are not harder, does not scale level etc. lol, meeting many level 5 as lvl 71 etc. Terrible designs, really. 

Other:
- First time I played Starfield, we could not design the inside of our spaceship, this I found so annoying and bad since it's our only real home base due to the lacking/bag storage system in Starfield. We now can in newer patch. Great QoL update, same about the car. 
- Outpost and several other talents are annoying and pointless due to NG+ design? 
- I do miss ""Dogmeat""(Fallout) as a companion :P, where is he? My best good boy....
- You can romance in the game, more or less whoever you want(I think), if that is your thing. I went with Sarah. You wouldn't think so, but she is a wild cat, not boring at all ;)
- Would be cool if we could upload images and add them as posters to our outposts?
- We need better menu/item overview etc. Why can we even see all these cards/keys in misc when we cannot do anything with them anyway? Remove them to some key pocket thing?
- We should be able to spawn the car and somewhat be able to harvest from it imo? I do see some problems, since you can fast travel to your ship even when overloaded from car. 
- Would be nice with a tmogger btw, to change our char etc.
- Graphics are very great, stunning! My PC is pretty bad, even on low it's great(Anyway, who can honestly upgrade their PC's every year? - Not to mention climate etc.) 
Combat is great imo. 
Voicing is great, but faces are a bit stiff at times, mimic is poor(it's better in Shattered space).

I would say, it is a great game/entertaining, even though the game is lacking some QoL, I give the game 9,3/10.  I think this massive open world game deserves 9,3, yeah, it's fair.",True,0,43735
Starfield,1716740,201014634,"While it could be summed up as ""Oblivion/Skyrim/Fallout...but in space,"" there is a deeper level of engagement with the player.
While it's not perfect, Starfield has definitely captured my attention as an interactive story with a dense galaxy sized nebula of stories, quests, economics, and character development.
While there are some heavy-handed ""these are the baddies"" elements that slightly detract from my immersion into the universe, there are some nice nuanced factions and even characters within factions that nicely represent those bits of inconvenient reality one runs into during the course of life.
I appreciate the numerous patches addressing bugs, adding features, and QoL improvements.

A specific gripe (that might be resolved already from a mod, perhaps?) pertains to the ship design mechanic: I wish ""module not connected"" errors would highlight or flash which parts are disconnected, as I have repeatedly experienced things such as a small shield module that were left unattached once the part supporting it was changed or moved, but is not readily apparent that it's to blame for the error.

I am only on my first playthrough, and while I'm not nearly as far down the skills tree as I'd like to be yet, at level 25, I don't feel that I'm pigeonholed into numb grinding activities in order to get over a particular hurdle in my progression. There seems to always be something else you can explore or invest in to make the time you play return the level of enjoyment you expect. This game has been a good value for the money.

I do recommend that players are mindful of all the little touches the developers have put in every square meter of the environment. It's easy to become fixated on mission completion and totally miss the 'mise en scene' of a station, outpost, or ship which tells a much deeper story than the character interactions (whether through persuasion, plot exposition, or their untimely demise) you may experience. Sometimes the little things - such as which hands of cards were  dealt out on a table - can give you insights into important elements of the characters and story you are encountering.",True,0,9439
Starfield,1716740,201002810,"I realized I had never reviewed this game. Really the word for it is ""meh"". ""2000 planets"", ""futuristic weapons"", ""multiverse theory"", ""space flight"", ""ship building"". They're all sort of 'there', but in the most basic form that'd allow them to market those terms without sounding like false advertising.

The gameplay proposes interesting stuff like armor and weapon perks along with randomized loot, which on paper should make for a fun game, but in reality they didn't make a single perk interesting, or crucial, much less over-powered. Rather than tiered weapons and noticeable upgrades along loot rarities, you just get a slop fill of meh weapons with meh upgrades that allows you to try everything without missing out, but also means everything is mostly samey. Finally, if you ever feel like pursuing a particularly nice legendary effect combo? You'll never get it unless you're stupidly lucky.

Combat AI is exceedingly dumb, sad even. What little entertainment there is in finding good guns and armor is made completely irrelevant by enemies that don't even try to survive. It also means that you kill a guy with a weapon, and when you loot him it gets turned into a randomized enchanted weapon that the npc was clearly NOT using against you.

Planets are not even that varied, so it's irrelevant to have 2000 empty balls of procgen wasteland when 10 would work fine for the main quest and most secondaries as well. Outpost building on them can be kinda nice, but there's no variety to structures or furniture, and thanks to traders it is made completely skippable.

The story is forgettable at best. It's Skyrim in space with a few somewhat interesting multiverse stuff dispersed in that you never really get to properly probe, question or experience between the busy work of loading screens required to travel from place to place, and if you get to questioning too much?

Some other problems I have with the game are most of the spacesuits and weapon designs and variety, apart from the UC Vanguard sentinel spacesuit and UC Vanguard spacesuit i found the other suits, kinda not very appealing looking for a game set in well, space, when I first played and I was on the first mission ""one small step"" and at the part with the crimson fleet captain, the minute I saw him I thought ""he has such cool armor, I wish I could get that"" and to my disappointment albeit not surprise, he doesn't drop it, instead I got some ax that was better than the one I was already using, which brings me to my other point about the weapons, yes I do think many of the guns in this game look like very chunky and ugly designs, they do not bother me that much as I did think the gun play of this game was not horrible, BUT my biggest issue was the absolute gutting of melee weapons in this game, I always loved to play many of Bethesda games (more specifically fallout) with melee only, as I found it way more fun to wack enemies then shoot them, but in this game, instead of having a few unique melee weapons,we got 9 and they are all bladed, no blunt weapons, no cool sci-fi type of melee weapons, just 9 bladed weapons and that frustrates me so much,and the story of this game just felt so...Unengaging, I just did not care about it, I didn't care the characters I couldn't get behind any of it, which when I first started playing this game, felt strange as I was able to engage and enjoy most other Bethesda game stories, even Fallout 4 as much as I didn't enjoy the game,but this story just felt...lifeless in a way I can't explain.",False,3,544

Numbers like this are what people like Todd exclaim first and foremost about how their games are played, as an exclamation of excellence. It is held up like a trophy, “revel in our success”.

In this case however, instead of playing it for some kind of enjoyment, I racked up those hours trying to find the justification for Bethesda releasing this game at all.

Coming down the elevator and entering the cinematic at the start of the game, I was holding onto years of anticipation for this release, but also the lessons learned through 40+ years and 10K+ hours of ....Bethesda.
During that opening cinematic, I witnessed one of the VERY few ""real"" conversations that I would experience during the entire playthrough, but I did not know that at the time, all  I was thinking of was my doubts about the improved graphics being able to hold up knowing what I do about the engine driving the system I was about to take a long ride in.

Upon release of my character, I rushed to the games UI, and my heart sank. What is this?
The SAME old clunky and outdated UI? And why was it even slower than previous games?
A tiny ember emerged right then, but I  pushed forward, spurred on by the thousands of hours of ""dedication?"" to Bethesda's previous titles.

My next step was being told by the supervisor and as a brand-new miner, that I was going to be the one responsible to proceed into the next area and to obtain some unknown and possibly dangerous item. 
For clarity, since the start of the game and up until that moment, I had just spent 9 minutes being lectured about safety, responsibility, and the importance of working together. So much for immersion eh?
This is Starfield. Written by people who apparently have no real-world experience and as such, simply have no idea how to emulate how a person would think, act, or communicate let alone build a world real enough to keep you inside of.

WIthin 20 minutes into the game, my random ""Joe"" just got handed a ship and was told: 
""fly.. be free""....like a child. Now I have a ship and have accomplished... nothing.

I played the first hour with that small ember turning into a hot coal as my brain tried to reconcile how ridiculous the ""story"" I was being presented with was, and a growing dislike for the games main companions. By hour 50, I wanted nothing to do with Constellation at all, and in retrospect, I think the game would have been much better without it. Just a world where you start as that miner and develop into something from there, supported by interesting questing and progression, but surely not ""Skyrim in space"". 

I spent the next 475 hours ensuring that I had explored every single element of the game. Every possible interaction, every planet, every scenario. I cannot stress to you enough how boring and tedious this became, but I was documenting everything along the way.  

The next 1200 hours was spent trying to ""fix"" what parts of the game I could. Tearing into the games actual bones made me come to the same conclusion of many (most?) of my fellow mod makers.  The game simply was not worth working with, and the stretched engine is a mess. I suspect major changes coming from Microsoft above soon regarding the Creation Kit.
Most of us quit, but some stayed, instead agreeing to follow the dangling carrot that is the mod store.

The dream of Bethesda handing us the bones to a ""modder's paradise"", a universe to do with as we could, was instead manipulated into method to generate cash from people formerly fixing their games for free. All brought to you by the originator of the plague that is microtransactions that has now spread worldwide to be the norm.
Although there is a very well-known saying among the community ""Beth makes games so that modder's can fix them"", in this case there is no fixing Starfield. No matter your skill, you cannot erase the stain of the games main story and its beyond irritating attempt at world-building. 

I finally quit the day they released the “buggy”, a vehicle with no storage, to bounce off things with for 20 minutes before never being used again in the mess of procedural generation  
10 minutes after that patch, I was done. The X-pac was paid for but never played. I thank myself for that decision.

Many others have noted how incredibly shallow and simply boring this game is, so I need not go further than confirm my wholehearted agreement beyond what has already been stated here in these reviews SO. MANY. TIMES.

Here are some things that perhaps others have not noted, or my case really burned my a**:

1. It's simply a downgrade compared to most developers in regards to innovation. Systems may have been imagined, but they were never implemented to the point of being useful.
2. There is NO FUNCTIONAL ECONOMY in Starfield.
3. The score/music sucks, begins to grind at you, and since there is...
4. NO radio? no real comm's? WTF? really? How many fast-travel and loadscreen issues could have been fixed with a simple comms device? Let alone some real tech.
5. There is NO SCIENCE or SPACE in this game about science... and space.
6.Its disgustingly ""safe"", politically correct, and generic. A masterclass in no chances were taken. This is the main reason why the quests are simply boring, there is no flavor to be had.
7. Whoever signed off on the clothing should be fired immediately.
8. Your ""Ship"" is nothing more than a settlement (think previous games) that LOOKS like a ship, but in this case you transport it via load screen from location to location. 
Actually flying in this game would let you actually see how bad the procedurally generated terrain actually is. And the next issue is the reason:
9. Tell me, how many rivers have you seen in Starfield?
Anyone can easily see with a good jetpack, let alone by simply using console commands to ""fly"" up and take a good look around at how lazy the terrain generation and object placement is. While doing so, make sure you track your framerate and you will know exactly why flying around planets was never implemented. (and never should be with this engine)
10. The character creator is simply lazy. A shallow step up at best for Beth, but bad compared to all other AAA studios. Even the best face modelers find it nearly impossible to create anything but a mediocre mess of a face in Starfield. It's no wonder the NPC's look so horribly bad. 
11. Combat barely improved (Gunplay, and only thanks only to id software for sure) but Bethesda still has not learned to code a character that wont get stuck on a stone let alone actually move or god forbid CLIMB like a game from 2025. Go play a game like Horizon ZD or FW and experience it's movement and combat then tell me Starfield's gameplay is up-to-date, acceptable, or even improved from previous titles with a straight face. You just cant. A jetpack does not make up for that.
12. Starfield's melee is a joke. I get that they ""had"" to put it in the game, but no effort or thought was put behind it because Bethesda STILL insists on the use of inflating enemy health pools as you level, a tactic that should have been put to full rest 20 years ago. 


After all this if you still decide to play Starfield for the first time, I would suggest the following:

1. Mainline the games ""story"" while doing everything you can to not look at the NPC's.
2. Never use the power ""sense life"" as it will forever wreck what you think you know about how enemy AI should work.
3. Do NOT fall into the trap that is the online ""store"" of ""mods"" for this game, as it is the ONLY reason Starfield exists. Please do not contribute to the problem.
4. When you play, do so inebriated so that your mind will have at least some chance to enable whatever suspension of logic and taste as is possible

I'll start with this. Amazing modability! (assuming you have the patience). Without mods? Rarely crashes, though you'd have to be actively trying to make it crash. However, with mods, it can either run incredibly smoothly or crash every two minutes. From my experience, this depends on both your hardware and your modding capabilities.

Without mods, though, I can say that the game gets rather dull after maybe your 5th or 6th NG+. There are subtle changes in these playthroughs, such as your crew being children in one NG+ or meeting yourself and having your past character join the crew. However, I personally spent at least 400 hours simply customizing and building ships. While vanilla ship-building can feel limiting after some time, using mods to add custom pieces and parts, and removing these limitations, almost makes the game feel truly endless.

While I mentioned it can get dull after a few NG+ runs, with mods, I’ve added in quests, new homes to decorate, and I’ve even used the Star Wars: Genesis mod collection to transform Starfield into an entirely new game. It’s far from perfect, but it has kept the game from becoming stale as I’ve played.

Don’t let other RPG titles, such as Baldur’s Gate and Dragon’s Dogma, deter you from this game, even though they are incredible in their own right. Starfield has that Bethesda charm that few games can match. Beneath the bugs, crashes, and randomness, there’s a story that’s both unique and time-consuming, with nice side quests to keep you busy.

When approaching a game like this, you have to keep in mind Bethesda’s past titles, such as Fallout 4 and The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, games that were also riddled with bugs and crashes, but today have become the foundation of the modding community. These are games that almost every PC player downloads the second they can, eager to push the limits of modding. Entire communities have dedicated themselves to turning these games into entirely new experiences, simply by using their engines. Fallout: London is a prime example.

Do not just take my word for it; I urge you to read at least five more reviews after this one. A game like this will require both time and patience. It’s fun in its vanilla state, but it can become legendary once you’ve taken the time to curate a mod list suited to your tastes—transforming a simple work of art into a masterpiece.",True,0,33513

Like everyone said, it's got a slow start, but things click a couple of dozen hours in- and it's a good feeling.  But in retrospect, I realize that a lot of the good feeling was anticipation for payoffs that never came.

I think Starfield game has several good game systems.  I enjoyed tinkering with my guns and building powerful spaceships.  I enjoyed completing challenges to unlock skill purchases.  I'm not a FPS connoisseur, so the gunplay was fun enough for me.  Spaceship combat was subpar, but seeing your custom ship elevated it.  I know the NASA-punk art style was controversial, but I found it novel and enjoyed it (especially once I got the not-Doom-Slayer suit).

The main story has a number of good ideas, too.  But in the main story, and in the characters- and in the dialogue- and in the quests- the execution /consistently/ fell apart.

Dialogue was terrible Millenial writing.  The cast were vomited straight out of DEI consulting pamphlets.  The companions range from repulsive to obnoxious to pretty but bland.  And perhaps most egregiously, in quest after quest, the game blocks you from doing the thing the player naturally wants to do.  The achievement of every quest had the good feeling stolen by stupidity and railroading.  

In short, everything that gives /meaning/ to your striving- helping characters you care about in a believable setting- was a letdown, time after time.

I found myself emotionally detaching from all the stupid turns of dialogue and story, gritting my teeth and holding out for ""the good part"".

Sure its well seasoned but the meat was raw now its just grey and chew. This game has a main story that honestly I couldn't give to squirts about least motivation. The game has good RPG mechanics and character building but often falls flat in practice, basically ends up using the system not enough. All of these perks to choose from and only so many dialogue options related to them also speech is worthless in this game as its a basically sums up to a quick match check not me choosing the dialogue that sounds the best. Again it has good RPG mechanics, but doesn't use them nearly enough. I'm gonna skip over the empty moons of this universe as its the common complaint. The new rover they added sucks. Its moves slow it is unfun to drive it can't make up its mind between halo style steering and traditional WASD steers (but like a strafe) the mouse steers it more for some reason. Did i mention it lacks traction a slight inclines but on the same planet will drive up a freaking cliff face without issue. The guns though work do suck. I think bethesda just likes making gun designs to rile up gun nerds at this point. if so top kek ya got me. that being said weapons go like this find something you like use it eventually find the advanced beowulf never ever use anything else because 7.77mm is everywhere in the galaxy (ammo is not a complaint thats one of the good things in this game a lot of games make me ask why did this guy only have 4 bullets on him i shot him in the head from behind where did his ammo go?) Combat is one of those things that are a mixed bag did you like fallout 4 good youll like the gun play in this its pretty much that but a bit more up to date.

It is visually stunning.

The UI sucks. Had to be modded. Speccing into many of the option means you'll spend a ton of time in menus, and the menus weren't made to spend a ton of time in them. 

The game seems to assume that you will play it for at least 120 hours, so it has a ton of content. Problem is, most of that content is not compelling, especially to do repeatedly. 

The worldbuilding is borderline nonsensical, and constantly undermines itself by having elements that remind you it is a game at all turns.

Starfield,1716740,200414240,"This game has seen its fair amount of hate and disinterest but I think this game is an interesting and somewhat unique experience. I see a lot of people compare this game to no mans sky or any other space games and I think this is a bad example to use. Starfield is not No Mans Sky. Starfield focuses more in story and dialogue with certain aspects sprinkled in like: Bounty hunting/other guild work, ship building, and random encounter you might find in space. This is a good space game, however, it is not the best and doesn't come close to others. While I praise the story there are lots of things this game could've done better. Starting with music, while fallout or the elder scrolls have iconic and thematic music pieces, with Starfield it is the opposite. Along with comparisons to fallout or the elder scrolls I think that those games do a good job at making you feel important in those worlds but in Starfield you are just a random to everyone and you also don't even become important in guilds. I think a good fix for that could've been an interstellar newsletter or something of the sort. Next, exploration. A lot of people have complained about this and I can only agree when comparing to no mans sky. Planets are not different, and if they are its very minor differences. This, along with relatively flat terrain on every single planet makes for a very boring exploring experience. One fair criticism I think is the use of planets. While No Mans Sky basically requires you to gather supplies from planets, which gives them a good reason to be explore, Starfield gives you no reason to explore and no reason to invest in the things that do require gathering supplies. I also do not really like the realistic NASA type asthetic with the film grain and bland coloring. I see the vision but it does not work well and especially when you look at other space games.

Starfield,1716740,200398649,This game fucking sucks,False,3,3427
Starfield,1716740,200397597,"Starfield is yet another example of developers believing that all they have to do is make any kind of first person shooter game (even a more polished shooter… with jetpacks), and people will be too excited and/or inexperienced to realize what the title is lacking, for such an exorbitant price. The delivered experience capitalizes gameplay elements that players have already had in other games, while not meeting the expectations of what the game promised to do differently.

I have been a Bethesda games fan for a long time. I played my first RPG with oblivion, Fallout 3 opened my eyes to what a first person shooter could be, and New Vegas opened my eyes to the depth that could be achieved when video games combined storytelling and gameplay correctly. After playing through Skyrim thoroughly, I got my first gaming PC and started learning modding so I could make the game my own, like many others have. Fallout 4 was an even better education, and it was the modding communities that took it from being a good game, to an amazing sandbox experience that still continues to grow like Skyrim’s player base. The education I got expanded to help me understand more about file structure and how games work, and the communities I interacted with have been the life blood that has kept me and other players coming back. The experience and the people improving it, have been such a big impact to me personally. I am truly grateful to be a part of that rich history and the people who have helped shape it.

Make no mistake, Bethesda has built up their business on the backs of players creating these types of fixes: the players have not only been their testers and source of feedback; they have been the source of inspiration for original content that people actually want. More importantly they have created the script fixes and community updates that have helped Bethesda games work the way they were marketed to work.

It is for these reasons that I am deeply discouraged and like many others have communicated… deeply disappointed, that Bethesda has chosen to capitalize on a tremendous opportunity for future player creativity, by adopting the ""nickel and dime” approach to their newest releases as the corner-stone of their business model. The inherent lack of any real story in a game that amounts to “fast travel artifact fetching”, is just the surface of what is disappointing about this game. Past the OCD ship building, the experience becomes more and more watered down the further into the game you get.

It would have been different if Starfield had a slightly rushed or arguably unfinished main quest, but even the unpolished ending of Fallout 4 was still made less painful by the modding communities that made comprehensive fixes to the story and built up the world the way it needed to be. As inspiring as it may be for some to hear ol’ Todd wax philosophical about storytelling, Starfield delivers even less on the creation of rich story telling than Peter Dinklage trying his best to make the writing in his final GoT speech sound authentically believable. There is sadly not enough of a story in this game to create a corresponding fix to make it have any real depth:

Bethesda created a plot that plays like a frustrating grindy loop (quite literally), with travel elements that are boring, sidequests that are forgettable, loot that is uninspiring and less and less unique, interactions and relationships that are bland, and enemy bases with layouts that defy logic while needlessly having players travel from one puzzled corner to the next… just to flip a switch. It’s like Bethesda put in the proper amount of time into the project to polish it, and instead spent the time working really hard to give us the illusion of depth.

As a result of Bethesda’s decision to control the modding experience for Creation content that was once free, mod creators are now no longer making content for ANY platform. Forget new skins, armor, and ship additions… where are the bug fixes?! Where are mods that limit background static, help menus load faster, or make details of gameplay function without the occasional glitch or cause your whole game to crash? No one experiencing known issues in-game is creating fixes, because their mods are more highly scrutinized by Bethesda’s need to put a dollar amount on mods.

And so, the most advanced Bethesda game to date (now more than two years after its release), is completely dry of any compelling new content, as the developers assumed players would continue to create the experience after its release.

Bethesda is not the first to take the easy road of appealing to newer players who don’t know they are overpaying for content, but it is still sad to see Bethesda leaning into these kinds of mistakes on this release, instead of learning from them. Bethesda has already made their money back on this title, and they have achieved this in part at the expense of distancing themselves from the player base that made them their fortune.",False,6,35466
Starfield,1716740,200397312,"So incredibly middle of the road that I don't know whether it's a good or bad game. There's no sense of adventure or danger like in other Bethesda games because literally every planet you go to has already been colonized by other people first. The UC Vanguard and Crimson Fleet quests are fun but they're sandwiched between so many ""go here talk to this person and come back"" that it just drags. Also, LOADING SCREENS, I hope you love them because I swear half the game is just loading screens. So much content in Starfield but it's mostly just meh. Worth a try and there are some high points but there's just way too much talking in this game and not enough interesting information to justify all the talking and text options.

I don't know anyone who likes it, it's genuinely rare for me to not enjoy a game as my standards are super low.",False,7,1069
Starfield,1716740,200393472,"StarField was over-hyped for sure!! However, it's not a bad game. So let's talk about that.

What Do I think of starfield:
It's an OK game, with great art style, great verity of guns and armor to collect and combine for a verity of play styles, the story is OK, faction stories and missions are fun. And the general game play feels great, space ship controls are basic, ship combat is simple and easy to manage granted you have the right equipment to deal with whoever is attacking you. 

The big problem with the game is for me 3 main things. 
1. While I really enjoy some of the game play aspects, I think the procedural generation is a big letdown and not because it's there, but because it makes the world feel small. You don't choose where to land exactly as it will just land you in the general area you selected. When you land, there is a mission or some random location, but outside of that there is nothing else really. So you just go do your mission and if you don't see anything in the distance you just go to your ship and fly off. It does not provide any incentive to explore outside of the handcrafted mission areas which is a real shame, as the feeling of adventure is largely derived from being interested to travel and search for some adventure, loot, quest, etc But there is none of that here.

2. the economy being so tedious where you can only sell a couple of things before the vendor runs out of money, you just wait in a chair in front of them and you can sell things again! This is not Skyrim and there is really no need to have us wait multiple times just to sell of the stuff we looted during a single mission. We have ships that can fly to other planets at will! but a vendor cannot buy multiple armor pieces from me without being bankrupt??

3. Bugs, unfinished game systems, missing maps etc when the game was launched. Even now that most of these have been resolved, it did impact my experience as I needed to reload saves multiples times due to quests not working, Pirate ship getting stuck with me on it and pirates disappearing causing me not being able to simply walk of the ramp. Base building which is very strange and does not feel good to actually interact with outside of simply needing to. Not being helped by the fact that again you can't really choose where to land exactly and it becomes a luck thing if you will find the things you are looking for or just have to retry a couple of times to get a location that is somewhat decent. 
All of these combined are things that did impact my enjoyment regularly.

I did not mention the ship building, as I personally don't think it adds much to the game. You can buy decent ships when you get some money. And you don't actually fly your ship all that much (I know!) you only fly in a procedural generated area when you are animated into space. You either run into some encounter (friendly or not) and just open the map to auto navigate to your destination (Yes, this game will have you go through 5 loading screens one after the other very regularly and I simply put up with it as the wait is not long)


Overall, if you like the premise of Starfield, you like the art style and decent gun play, you like the space setting and are in to experience a space faring story. You will enjoy this game especially after most of the bugs have gotten fixed.
However! don't expect this to be a grand adventure like previous Bethesda games. This is more a game you will play, get through the story and do whatever faction/side quests you find interesting. And when you are done you won't feel the need to jump back into the game as it does not have anything to offer that you have not already seen/done enough off.
There is no point to go on random exploration, no point in just going your own way and running into adventure as that is simply not the experience Starfield is shooting for (or it failed massively if that was the case :D ).
Even the DLC they released is so minimal in content that I would not even consider buying it at any price. I'm simply done with StarField and looking back, I think this game should be about 30% cheaper. Because at full price I don't think it's worth it.

Now on a separate note! If you want to play a game that will knock your socks off. Also based in space, with better combat, better story (you will have to put in some time though), Better guns, better gear (no competition even), more customization, better ship combat, and is Free! Try WarFrame (welcome Tenno!). Oh and! don't watch any endgame tutorials/videos!! really!! You will only need them after 200+ hours of game play. Maybe even more!

Beautiful new world to traverse
An interesting main quest
Custom ships and outpost building

Glitches everywhere!
You need material to build your outposts but the material weighs so much it takes eons and a lot of frustration to create a single space

 Ein neues Spiel von Betatesta, irre. Mal sehen. Ah, Mist... da bin ich doch glatt auf euch Schlingel hereingefallen. Starfield ist kein Spiel, es ist eine Modding Platform, welche zweifelhaften Talenten die Möglichkeit bietet ihre ""Creations"" feilbieten zu können.
Es taugt zum rekrutieren neuer Talente, die hoffentlich an ElderScrolls 6 oä. arbeiten werden. Der Rest ist genau das: 
Ein Gerüst, modular, flexibel und Bethesda typisch: Jahre hinter allen aktuellen technischen Möglichkeiten. Ich muss mir  anhand der Rezensionen auch klar machen: Solche Entwickler habens weitgehend hinter sich, ich will keine 70+dlv+dlc+dlc+doppeld+micromade bezahlen müssen um mein Spiel vollständig oder gar: fehlerfrei; besser: wie beschrieben, zu erhalten. 
Ich freue mich aber auch irrsinnig darüber, die Verkaufszahlen, gelegentlich, zu beaugapfeln. Die Idee mit Währung für Bockmist Geld zu verdienen, stirbt endlich aus, großartig. Die Zukunft darf gerne kommen! Ohne Starfield oder ähnlich minderwertiges in unser aller Leben, können wir uns getrost aufmachen, ins Sternenmeer (Starfield- Sternenfeld, das klingt so typisch winzig, so kraftlos: ganz Bethesda.). Dorthin wo Prüfungen auf uns warten die nicht mit minderwertiger Software gelöst oder schlampiger Programmierung zum Zwecke der (Gewinn-)maximierung übergangen werden können.
 
Ich bin auch sehr froh, darüber, daß ich noch etwas Zeit habe um mir anzusehen, wie eine weitere der ""alten"" (will sagen: antiquierten) Softwareschmieden, welche vom Konsumenten (aus der Perspektive der Publisher sind wir Konsumenten, weder Kunden, noch Spieler und absolut nicht: Eigentümer der Spiele) abhängig sind, zerbröseln. Es tut mir jedoch sehr leid, für die Kaufkraft, die hier ihr Ziel gefunden hat. 
Ich gehe jede Wette ein: mit der Kohle hätten die smarteren Steam Nutzer locker 'ne eigene IP auf die Beine gestellt, mit Weltraum im Spiel und mit Sternen, nicht gepresst in winzige ewig gleiche Karten mit endlos identischer Flora, Fauna (sofern überhaupt vorhanden), Texturengegnernundallemandernbiszummiesensoundinsendloseprozedualgeneriert x1000, weils game 1000 Planeten hat, was ne Lüge ist: Es gibt im Spiel keine Planeten, das sind kleine Maps mit minimalem Inhalt, da die Engine veraltet ist und kein(Beth-) Entwickler Lust hat was Neues (in dem Fall, eher was Altes: ein gutes Spiel abliefern) zu machen: der nächste... ""coole DLC"" muss dringend raus, sonst stimmt die Immersion (tolles Schlagwort: Immersion...) nicht, da: die Acrylhufe net gscheit auffen Hachsen halten wollen.
Seid mutig, ihr wundervollen, jungen Entwickler. Ihr beweist täglich auf's Neue, was in euch steckt, wenn man euch nicht in Felder presst. 
Hey du, ich danke dir für's Lesen, hättest du nicht extra machen müssen.

A new game from Betatesta, crazy. Let's see. Ah, crap... I completely fell for you rascals. Starfield isn't a game, it's a modding platform that offers dubious talent the opportunity to offer their ""creations.""
It's good for recruiting new talent who will hopefully work on Elder Scrolls 6 or something similar. The rest is exactly that:
A framework, modular, flexible, and typical of Bethesda: years behind all current technical capabilities. Based on the reviews, I also have to realize: These developers are largely past their prime; I don't want to have to pay 70+ DLV+DLC+DLC+DoubleD+Micromade to get my game complete or even: bug-free; better: as described.
But I'm also incredibly happy to occasionally squint at the sales figures. The idea of making money with currency for crap is finally dying out, great. Welcome to the future! Without Starfield or anything similarly inferior in our lives, we can confidently set off into the sea of stars (Starfield—starfield, that sounds so typically tiny, so powerless: all of Bethesda.) There, where trials await us that cannot be solved with inferior software or circumvented with sloppy programming for the purpose of (profit) maximization.

I'm also very glad that I still have some time to watch another of the ""old"" (meaning: antiquated) software companies, dependent on the consumer (from the publishers' perspective, we are consumers, neither customers nor players, and absolutely not owners of the games), crumble. However, I feel very sorry for the purchasing power that has found its destination here.
I'll bet anything: with that money, the smarter Steam users could have easily created their own IP, with space in the game and stars, not crammed into tiny, eternally identical maps with endlessly identical flora and fauna (if they even exist), textured enemies, and everything up to the ugly sound in endless procedurally generated x1000, because the game has 1000 planets, which is a lie: There are no planets in the game; they're just small maps with minimal content, because the engine is outdated and no (Beth) developer is interested in making something new (in this case, more like something old: delivering a good game). The next... ""cool DLC"" urgently needs to be released, otherwise the immersion (great keyword: immersion...) won't be right, because: the acrylic hooves won't keep their feet on the ground.
Be brave, you wonderful, young developers. You prove every day what you're capable of when you're not forced into a box.
Hey you, thank you for reading, you didn't have to do that.

I still recommend this game, although I want to highlight some things:

- the game is not Fallout/Skyrim in space. It's more of an open world RPG
- building has no added value. In Fallout4 I used to build giant settlements, hours of work, designing and extending. Here I built one or 2 outposts but the building system is counter-intuitive and not needed
- once you have a nice spaceship, with enough storage, you are good
- companions are useless. I walked with Dani Garcia for a long time, there was no interaction. But at some point I was at Constellation I got like 5+ optional companions. I walked with Sam Coe for some time, but I never got to the highest affinity level. 
- companion stories are boring, uncompelling
- the game is beautiful, so much to do and see, but many places I never went to, the galaxy is just too big to visit every corner
- also maps were too big, there was a clear path to the next target, but I saw huge extra places I could go to, but I was not encouraged to do so 
- in Fallout4, I extensively modded weapons/armor etc, but here I modded absolutely nothing. Modding/crafting is not needed at all for the game. 
- the skill system is too big. I became level 40 when ending the main quest, but the only skills I used are weapons, lock-picking, carry weight, persuasion and some ship skill (shields, targeting). The rest of the skill are overkill IMO 
- too many weapon types, in the end I always used only Maelstrom and Grendel, and then upgrading each time when I got a better version


In the end, still a nice game. I still need to start shattered space.

Initial review .
I anticipated this game for years. When it finally came out, I was disappointed by the reviews and decided to delay a purchase. So regularly I came back to see if there are improvements, since I also know Bethesda..they tend to fix the game after release and keep improving it.
Reviews were still mixed so I decided to buy it during the Summer sale last weeks.

I really don't understand the bad reviews. I have now about 20+ hours in the game and I love it. The depth, the options are overwhelming. The stories are OK, currently undercover for the UC in Crimson Fleet, I am travelling around in the Sol system, New Homestead, Cydonia, Triton, and enjoying every part of it.

Starfield,1716740,200226524,"Of course! Here is a revised and improved version of your Starfield review, correcting the errors and organizing your points for better clarity. This is ready to be posted.

A Great One-Time Journey, A Flawed Forever Game
I want to start by saying that my first playthrough of Starfield was a great experience. I am a completionist, and I loved how many side quests there were to get lost in. The game is incredibly complex, with deep systems for ship and outpost building that seem designed for multiple playthroughs. For that first journey, I spent countless hours and had a lot of fun.

However, this is where the game catastrophically fails. The core game balance is completely broken.

On my second playthrough, just three hours in, I lost all motivation to continue. The gameplay loop became a tedious chore. Every visit to a city involved running from shop to shop, selling enough gear to completely empty every vendor's bank account. After that, my only options were to find a bed, wait 24 hours for the shops to get more money, and then repeat the process. There is no logic or fun in this.

The problem is that the game's economy does not scale with your level. High-level items are worth more than all the vendors in an entire city have combined. With a few good skills, you can make money so easily that it ruins any sense of challenge or progression. It feels like this core issue has been abandoned, as there have been no fixes for such a simple but game-breaking problem.

Conclusion:

I recommend playing Starfield for one, single playthrough. It is a fun and massive game that is worth the time for that initial adventure. However, I will not be purchasing the DLC. Core economic fixes like this should be part of the base game, not something we have to hope for in paid content.

It's truly a shame that such a great idea with so much potential falls apart because of a simple lack of balance, which completely kills the replayability it was clearly built for.",True,1,13939

Starfield,1716740,200209580,"I've had this game for a while - and kind of neglected it because so many people gave it bad reviews.

I decided recently to pick it up and put some time into it and to start with I NEVER play a Bethesda Game without mods - so I went on nexus and started looking.  I started with ~30 QoL mods that seemed like something I would want, but none of them are game-play changing mods.

I don't really understand why this got bad reviews.  It's a classic Bethesda game.  My biggest complaint is the companions the game has aren't unique enough for my liking, they all seem to behave similarly.

A lot of people have been riding on the procedural world gen - but I don't even think that is all that bad.  I've yet to find a place where it really bothers me.

I wished the weapon/suits/crafting modifications was similified - but again that is a normal Behesda game.

Starfield,1716740,200207764,"I don't know where to begin.
I watched the showcase back in the summer of '23, and preordered the most expensive version of the game like an idiot. I was so damn hyped and love BGS and space. My first playthrough was roughly 20 hours and I beat the game 2 days after it came out in early access. I loved it, although it was a nightmare to get it to run at 60 on my gtx 1660 ti lol (still isn't optimized well). The story is really nice and the ending and the whole way they handled NG+ is creative. But that's it.
Starfield is a game that checks the boxes. It looks nicer than other BGS games, has very polished gunplay, and you can get some cool choices to make. However, it does all of these just to the bare minimum. Maybe I expected too much, but this game was just kind of underwhelming. After the novelty wore off, I didn't want to do more. Space was underwhelming, planets were all so similar, and story didn't capture a feeling in me that made me need to experience it again. 
Starfield 2 years later is unfortunately the same. They added a car, fixed some bugs, and Shattered Space came out. And yet I never felt the need to play it. Unfortunately, Starfield is just aggressively mid. It's not bad but it is just a game. It isn't the groundbreaking new Bethesda IP we all wanted, but it's not the nail in the coffin for Bethesda. It's just kinda like a B tier restaurant that isn't bad but you wouldn't eat there again.",False,4,3479

I really thought this was going to feel like skyrim in space and it just doesnt, and after now playing Oblivion rem i know its because its lacking that immersive touch that came from people that dont work at bethesda anymore, sorta like what happened with bungie/343. The repeating planet surfaces RGN planets cause this its like no mans sky after the 10th planet they are all the same, shallow story feel, and just idk kinda just a let down. Like people say there is so much that should have been in the game but seemingly was intentionally left somewhat barren or lacking to promote a pay per mod system. 

The problem also is games arent cheap to make anymore so big devs are almost locked into having to do this shady monetization to keep their giant overhead, larian is the only dev i can think of that seems to realize you make the game good and the money will follow.

Starfield,1716740,200187091,"I honestly felt like I was playing a game from over a decade ago. Every time you enter a small room or building, it has to reload the map. There are barely any cutscenes, characters have stiff facial expressions, and dialogue is just them standing there while different lines of text pop up. The quest design is painfully childish — it’s all filler. Go to a place, pick up an item, fight a few mobs along the way. That’s it. Dialogue choices barely make a difference beyond changing the text slightly. The whole story is laughably hollow, trying to sound deep with this vague ‘multiverse’ concept, but really it’s just nonsense.

And don’t even get me started on the game mechanics. I get it — in a post-apocalyptic setting like Fallout, having limited ammo makes sense. But in this game? I can’t even stock enough ammo for all my guns. If you don’t know how to design a proper system, maybe just remove it altogether.",False,4,3213

0/10 - fun time",True,0,912
Starfield,1716740,200183433,"Even after 86 hours, I am still thoroughly enjoying Starfield. It takes elements of Bethesda's style of RPGs and mixes them with core elements of Star Citizen, No Man's Sky, Mass Effect and other games to create an enjoyable space RPG experience. 

The core elements it borrows from those other games aren't done as well as they're done in the other games, but they give Starfield so much more to do overall than any of them individually. It doesn't have the same level of heart and storytelling that Mass Effect has, but it does have a sense of exploration, discovery and open world elements that Mass Effect lacks while capturing good action RPG gameplay. It's got a realistic sense of scale but doesn't have seamless transitions and superior planetary tech like Star Citizen. It feels so much more alive than Star Citizen due to the characters, story elements and flavor added even to side quests and missions. No Man's Sky captures a truly endless universe and does so with plenty of variety but lacks the realism that Starfield still manages to capture. Outpost building in Starfield lacks some of the variety compared to No Man's Sky but ship building in Starfield feels very satisfying. There are a lot of other elements you could compare, but the pattern essentially continues in the same way.

While there are plenty of disappointing, under-cooked elements, I think ultimately systems in Starfield that are ""good enough"" are often faulted for not being excellent like there are in other games. Starfield is very much a jack of all trades but master of none. By far the biggest disappointment in the game is the fact that, apart from initial bug fixes and QoL improvements, Bethesda seems to have abandoned the game. A little more polish could have improved the disappointing elements and made some of the things that were done well enough to become legitimately good. There's a lot of potential here and I hope that this game can be revived.

Regardless of the disappointments, this is still a fun game as is and I will continue to thoroughly enjoy it for many hours to come.

Starfield,1716740,200124437,"Starfield is one of the most disappointing games I've played. I love the idea of a rich space RPG where you pilot a starship, explore a galaxy, and get involved in the politics and intrigue of all the civilizations you discover out there.

But Starfield so poorly executes on that vision, both technically and in terms of the game's design, that it just boggles my mind as to how a game company with the resources of Bethesda, with the same talent that created Fallout 4 and Skyrim, could create such a disaster. 

--

The pacing of the game is entirely off. They begin by dumping you into a huge city filled with more than a dozen quests that all end up being boring fetch missions and exposition dumps. I kept hoping the next quest would be interesting. But no, the next one was just the same as the last. No intrigue, no choice, no way to express my character, no different outcome based on my choices. Heck, even my starting traits mattered little. I'm not sure why these quests are here; if you aren't going to lead with your strongest quests, I'm not sure why you'd begin by placing your players there.

There's no sense of discovery as in Fallout or Skyrim, as many others have written about. You teleport from POI to POI, all separated by loading screens, rather than piloting your own ship. No Man Sky figured out how to do it, why can't Starfield?

There is an annoying stutter on my machine, even though I have an extremely high-end rig. Though, the textures are high-resolution and the art design is beautiful.

Crafting is overwhelming. There are an intimidating number of inputs to crafting, all slightly different in confusing ways. Like, I wanted to get into cooking, but I couldn't find any bread - a required input. I bought items that sounded like bread, but they aren't valid inputs. I visited several stores looking for bread, and wasn't able to find one. I don't understand.

There's a lack of game design polish everywhere. I've mentioned crafting already, but let's take pick pocketing: There's no pickpocket minigame. You just walk up to someone and see an HTML pop-up menu. Just click the item you want to take. How boring.

Menus feel designed for consoles, I guess, and have far too many clicks to get what you want out of them. Real estate is wasted on close-ups of items, for some reason.

--

Nothing feels like it works together. It seems obvious to me that they hired an army of artists to make tons of different items, a ton of writers to come up with a ton of small, meaningless quests, an army of level designers and environment artists to make tons of cities and caves and interiors, a few game designers to separately craft the trait systems, combat systems, crafting systems, spaceship systems, outpost systems. And then they sort of smashed everything together. What we get at the end just doesn't work together, and all sort of sucks as a result.

But I was fine with that. Whatever. It's janky, okay? It's too big? It's a little stuttery? Fine. Whatever. I was okay with all that. It's a huge space game, but I love space. I'll deal.

What broke me, dear reader, was a stupid side quest to go to a supposedly dangerous cave that claimed dozens of lives on Mars and pick up a precious rock, the Heart of Mars, that was worth thousands. The quest giver strongly emphasized how haunted and dangerous this place was.

Reader, there was nothing interesting about the cave I teleported to. Nothing happened when I walked in. No enemies. No environmental hazard. No puzzle. It was just a cave. 

But what broke me and made me write this review wasn't the terrible quest, it was this: I couldn't pick up the Heart of Mars itself. The quest was bugged.

I google it, and discover posts from 2 years ago saying how this quest is broken, and you need to use a console command to clip through the ground and grab it from under the ground. Oh, and doing that disables achievements. Unless you download a mod.

Best of all, I see a developer post saying it was fixed, two years ago.

Dear reader, it definitely isn't fixed. And it probably won't ever be fixed.

--

Starfield is unfinished and undesigned. It should have sat in early access until every issue was fixed and they had figured out a fun game out of all these disparate pieces. This game was not ready. And given the continued unresolved issues, it likely never will be.

It is odd to go into a room and scan the characters, only to know what role they play and what they will say, provided you still want to listen to the committee/AI generated dialog.

The UI feels like a South Korean MMO from about 2005, minimal, drab, yet still hard to read.  What makes it bad is that the player will find themselves in the menus a lot.  Go Murder Hobo then spend 5 minutes managing inventory and plotting the fast travel.  Want to base build, same deal.

My main issue is that they have claimed it's a 'huge universe' simply because they have a bunch of planets you can land on. But the catch is, it's all procedurally generated. You can land on one planet, and encounter the exact same fauna/flora as you did on a planet on the other side of the universe. The creatures and plants will have totally different names to the carbon copies you encountered before. 

You will then land on that same planet at a later date, and the whole lay out will be completely different. 

And there are seemingly randomly placed structures on moons, again procedurally generated. The lack of continuity is a huge flaw. The buildings again. carbon copies of other buildings you've explored. 

MORE PLANETS does NOT EQUAL high quality gameplay.

Starfield,1716740,199944449,"This was a title i wanted but couldn't have till i ""needed to upgrade my pc"" but i think it was worth it as it has really good foundations and a few good additions like the ability to fast travel to stores or across the stars without having to fly your ship. 

However the skill reliance on alot of skills in a space game is not good, needing rank 4 of pilot to fly class C ships is fine but i found a bug where i was able to build a class C ship but could not fly or  leave my seat i could fly it to planets/space battles/dock and board ships/stations, so i had to use console commands to fly it due to a story mission not letting me fast travel. 

Another thing is Xp gain is so grind heavy and the quest xp is laughable faster to hunt wild life than to do quest or anything else, i use a 5x gain (a bit much) but a 2.5 or 3 would be better.

Starfield,1716740,199865132,"This game is beyond good.  I don't understand or haven't experienced the things in the negative reviews.  I have been playing 28.5 hours and so far, prefer this game over the Fallout games.  This game is massive.  It is a little hard to review without leaving something out.  I've had to watch videos about how to mine resources and build ships because those systems are fairly intricate, considering these are optional side activities.  They seem certainly worth pursuing though.

The story, the factions, the quests and interactions with NPCs, no complaints here.  Not that I remember each quest from other Bethesda games, but these so far have found what NPCs have to say interesting enough and I usually accept their side quests which often have me going to a new planet.  Plus give me them credits!  I usually bring a companion they are great for extra storage and being bullet sponges.  I am curious what happens, if anything, if I keep flirting with Sarah.

Building and resources, and customization - wow.  I haven't really started doing anything with my ship, but I watched videos and looked at some ship parts in the game.  You can pretty much design what your ship looks using parts from different in game ship part manufacturers, inside and out.  I want to get a bigger ship so I can have room for work benches.  I heard you can assign a crew to certain jobs, but I haven't learned how that works yet.  The resource gathering, seems pretty good but I haven't gotten very far.  It seems like it could get complex if you start gathering from multiple locations and want to tie them all together.  You can also assign NPCs to stuff you build here according to tutorial videos.  I never cared for base building in fallout 4 but I will be trying this.

The skill tree, also no complaints.  It does take time to level up which can be a little agonizing since a lot of these skills effect your resource gathering or building, and research and gun upgrades.  But just another reason to keep playing.  That said, this game has a huge lifetime.  I will be playing this for years probably* just to see what I can unlock or fly to.

Some the Karins out there may have complained about planets not having enough variety, but I haven't really noticed.  I mean most planets should be empty right, that's as much as we know about space.  There are so many star systems in this game.  Most I can't go to right now or just haven't yet.  I think there are literally a thousand plus planets.  I have landed on some planets and gone into a build that turned out to be identical to another building on a different planet.  I am not going to give the game an over thumbs down for that.  It doesn't ruin game play it just dulls that part of exploration.  Nobody is forcing your hand.  Seriously - the game would be a terabyte and probably never release if they couldn't reuse some assets.  I give the Devs credit for making so many systems and making going to them fun.  It's pretty amazing you can pick any section of the planet to land on, not just marked outposts. I guess this is on the newer side, but having a vehicle in your ship is an awesome addition!  

This game graphically is very good and there is a ton to do.  It has kept me up later then I would like to stay up.  Super fun, good frame rates (rtx 4070)...I don't know.  I love it, and feel people fine one thing they don't like and then only talk about that.",True,0,6711

Starfield,1716740,199838441,"The game has a lot of the classic Bethesda elements.  If you've played Fallout and Elder Scrolls, you'll be pretty familiar with this game's systems.  The gun play is crisp and tactile, and is a massive step up from the Fallout games.  The crafting system can be deep, although many might consider it too much work to get all of the ingredients together to make it worthwhile, when purchasing the final product from vendors does the trick just fine.  

This is due in part to there being so many ingredients, but the Outpost system, while also deep, can largely be ignored.  Until they make some changes to the way Cargo Links work and give players the ability to dedicate a certain amount of cargo space to specific items or item types, the inter-outpost connectivity systems can be almost too convoluted to be worth the time.  I've set up my fair share of fully decorated and technically productive outposts, but then I end up mostly using it just for the launch pad to have access to all the ship modules.  

Most of the negativity I've seen online stems from both the lack of seamless transitions from ground-to-orbit or from planet-to-planet, and the frequent loading screens (doors and buildings) even when exploring on the ground.  While I can understand where that feedback is coming from with other space games from other developers having those features, after re-watching all of the promotional material from before launch, Bethesda never actually stated the game would be seamless: they simply didn't take to social media to curtail the rampant speculation when fans started theorizing about it prior to launch.  By not addressing that and instead remaining silent about it after the Starfield Direct, I personally think Bethesda failed to properly set player expectations for how these systems would function, which led to the disappointment of many fans who were expecting Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky, and subsequently much of the negativity surrounding the game.

The quest system is familiar, with main, faction, side, and activity/misc quests.  I've seen a lot of criticism about the game having bad writing, and while not every side or faction quest will blow you away with twists and turns or deep narratives, there are PLENTY of quests in all 4 of those categories that WILL do exactly that; consider the disparity in quality between something like the Thieves Guild quest line and the Civil War quest line in Skyrim, for example.  All I'll say, is do yourself a favour and play through the Crimson Fleet and the UC Vanguard quest lines.

My main gripe with the game is that the dungeons in Bethesda's other games have typically been rich in environmental storytelling, and while that's mostly the case in this game with each POI having it's own minor story to tell through terminal entries, notes, and/or audio logs, an issue you'll never run into with Fallout or Elder Scrolls is running into the exact same dungeon with the exact same environmental storytelling on 4 times on 3 different planets in one night.  All that being said, I don't think this completely ruins the game, though it can be immersion breaking at times.  The feeling of freedom you get from being able to check out that abandoned space station, that derelict ship, that named destination on a planet, coming across a random encounter after a Grav Jump, finding a spacer ship touched down on a planet, board it, and have it take off with you still inside is worth occasionally stumbling across the same POI that you did 20 min ago.  Maybe not every POI is going to be a new experience, but any of them COULD be.

On a more positive note, ship building is an absolute standout.  It offers unparalleled customization, letting you design everything from fighters to freighters. Any module you add to your ship, with the exception of the Structural modules, are not only cosmetic, but also impact performance or provide some function, like a control room providing greater crew capacity, or a living space module allowing for passengers.  The shipbuilding system is deep and can be a lot to learn at the beginning, but it's actually pretty intuitive and lets the player make a truly unique home base that they can take everywhere they go.  While you may not be able to seamlessly fly between planets, the ship combat is incredibly fluid and satisfying.  I never thought Bethesda would make vehicles with their engine, let alone vehicles that feel like they're flying (even if that's not what's actually happening behind the scenes,) but whatever magic they used to pull this off with the Creation engine... It just works.  Boosting, thruster maneuvering, distributing power, destroying and looting debris or disabling and boarding to fight the NPCs directly, commandeering the ship for yourself afterwards or simply making off with its cargo once everyone inside is dead; I genuinely think this game nails space combat, and fulfills the spacer/pirate fantasy more justice than any other game in the genre.  Total freedom.

Overall, the game isn't perfect, but I don't think any Bethesda game ever has been.  If you're a fan of past Bethesda games and haven't tried this one or are on the fence because of all the negativity and backlash online, I recommend giving it a go for yourself.  I've wanted a game like this for YEARS, and while NMS and Elite Dangerous came close, they couldn't quite scratch the itch I had.  Space exploration, ship combat, crisp shooter mechanics, exploration, AND actual stories and quests all rolled into one game.  I've had a blast for the whole 600 hours I've played so far.",True,1,38386
Starfield,1716740,199833605,"Man I dunno. It's been a while since I beat it. I didn't finish all the faction quests so maybe I missed the best parts. The ending was a nice twist.

Maybe wait for a good sale. If the dlc ever goes on sale I might try it out but then again my backlog is large enough to fill the rest of my days on this planet. When it all comes down to it, I'd probably rather play rimworld.

It didn't have fallout's charm, it didn't have skyrim's adventure, the story certainly wasn't as compelling as mass effect. It wasn't bad, it just need a little more to it.

Starfield,1716740,199831030,"Immersion is where Starfield earns its badge. The sense of scale is massive. You’re not just traveling planet to planet — you’re carving your legend across the galaxy. Between planetary scanning, mining resources, recruiting crew, or sweet-talking your way through politics, the game lets you live in its world.

It’s not always fast-paced, but it’s thick with detail. And when you’re sitting in the cockpit watching a sunrise over an alien world, it hits you.

Okay, let’s be honest — not everything is zero-grav gold.

Menus are a little clunky. Some planets are empty by design, which can feel like procedural filler. And fast travel can break immersion if you’re expecting seamless No Man’s Sky-style transitions.

But none of that overshadows the core experience — it just occasionally pokes you like a creaky door in an otherwise killer star ship. Combat is tight — more Fallout 4 than Skyrim, with weighty weapons, jet packs, and the occasional zero-G shootout that makes you feel like a bullet ballet dancer.

Ship combat? Chef’s kiss. If you ever dreamed of being Han Solo with a more questionable moral compass, customizing your own gunship and taking down pirates is your jam.

The RPG elements are deeper than you’d think: pick-pocketing, persuasion, science, stealth... it's all there, and your build matters.

It is bold, enormous, and undeniably Bethesda. It’s not a revolution, but it’s an evolution — a love letter to space, exploration, and the kind of freedom only video games can offer.

Starfield,1716740,199703956,"I decided to play Starfield on Xbox for Windows first, because it was free with my subscription, and I could see whether I liked it before buying. Yes, you'll have to buy the base game if you want to enjoy DLCs in future.

I read a number of reviews that give Starfield a mediocre score. If so, I would agree that it would be too expensive and give it a miss for a while.

I found that, as I liked Fallout 4, I also found Starfield to be quite a nice game. Very similar to Fallout 4 in many aspects, but different enough to warrant the investment of my hard-earned cash. The playing field is very much bigger for a start. The mechanics of movement, firing, etc., are very familiar. It is very much a Bethesda game.
 
On Xbox for Windows I found the game was quite jerky, with lots of waiting between cut-scenes, door openings, and so on.  I often found myself very frustrated and annoyed when, on meeting a new opponent and pressing fire, the PC stopped while loading the next bit of code. Then all of a sudden my PC would come to life and disorient me. Vocals also caused a big stalling on the Xbox for Windows version.

Not so on Steam. On Steam, Starfield is much smoother and more fluid. I have yet to experience the same freezing when firing at a new opponent. There is some delay of starting a speech scene, but I think that is n worse than in Fallout 4, and I can live with it.

I have a few other space shoot-em-ups, but Starfield is the most satisfying for me. I like that it has some of Bethesda's quirky animations - people walking in front of you as you're engaged in a shoot out, NPCs moving to and fro for no apparent reason, and your companion always getting under your feet.

Also, at the moment, at least, the Steam version has the best, and easiest to install, mods. However, as with Fallout 4, installing some mods in Starfield may affect your ability to progress in the game. For the moment I'm happy to play the vanilla game and enjoy a familiar yet, strange and new gaming environment.

Oh. And I paid for Starfield with my own cash - although, I did find a discount code and saved quite a bit. Saving now for the 1st DLC, which, again, has had disappointing reviews. We'll soon see about that. C'mon Bethesda and Steam how about a 50% discount?",True,1,51241

It's surprisingly well optimized running at 4k on a 4070ti I had 90-120 fps with no stutter and loading times were crazy fast so hats off to them for that. 

Story is a big old meh. Forgettable characters, repetitive content, weird quest design choices at times, but it was still enjoyable enough that I didn't need to force myself to finish it, I genuinely wanted to see it through.
Faction questlines were the most fun I had during my time on this game.

Gunplay is very solid, grounded and it feels great. Lots of weapons to use, decent gun modding.

This a not a space exploration game. This is not fallout or skyrim in space. It has that Bethesda game feeling, but it will never be what their other IP's are. Don't compare too much, don't expect too much, go in with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is.

Overall I'd give it a solid 7/10 and I'd recommend to buy it on sale.

Starfield,1716740,199617258,"The most mixed of bags. Fun, with good ideas, but deeply flawed. The very definition of wasted potential.

Starfield is, in essence, Fallout 4 taken to an extreme. The parts that worked are improved and expanded, while all the bad stuff is further neglected.

The gunplay is great, improved from already good system in Fallout 4. Dedicated grenade and bash buttons are very welcome, everything's more responsive and visually satisfying. There's also spaceship combat now, complete with boardings. You also have a drivable vehicle with a turret. Outposts are [i]fine[/i], resource gathering is more focused on outpost extractors and mining with a laser, but you can also do asteroid mining with your ship. There's a lot of POIs to explore and shoot through, so the looter-shooter aspect is definitely at it's best here.

On the other hand, the setting is bland and generic. There are some very cool elements, but they never really go anywhere. It's like they wanted to go full NASA-punk, which would be a cool and unique aesthethic, but abandoned the idea to give us Generic Sci-Fi Universe #44325. The factions and characters are forgettable, quests are boring with the exception of a few standouts, and the roleplaying potential is very shallow.

And then we come to the main reason behind the negative review - modding. Starfield fully integrates Bethesda's ""Creation Club"", allowing anyone to upload their mods to be purchased for ""creation credits"". A 500 pack of credits costs around 5$, and cheapest mods will run you 100 CC. I don't think I have to tell you that this was a horrible idea that hit the final nail in this game's coffin. Buying a mod for $1 sucks if you find out you didn't like it, or it's buggy, or it conflicts with your other mods, or it's outdated, or it bricked your save. And it will get expensive VERY QUICKLY, as many people consider a modlist of 100 individual mods to be ""very lightweight"", with some modlists hitting THOUSANDS, with many times that being testing of mods that didn't make the final cut. And that doesn't even touch upon lack of support for external tools, like MO2, BodySlide, DynDOLOD, xEdit, and many, many other essentials.

And if you look at NexusMods for Starfield, you'll see what it led to - a barren wasteland. Many mod authors who even started modding the game in the first place have already given up. The game has so many great systems that could make it the ultimate modding platform, like the procedurally generated planets, NG+, shipbuilding, drivable vehicles, and so much more. But none of that matters when there's no mods. Unless you want $1 weapon skin packs or player homes, there's NOTHING.

Ultimately, Starfield is a fun game for a few hours of looting and shooting. It's not a deep RPG, it's not a full-featured space sim, it's not a [i]great game[/i] - and because of Bethesda's vile murder of the modding scene, it never will be.",False,719,7124

In fact every time I sit down and think ""maybe I'll play through Starfield again,"" by the time I boot up Steam and am ready to click 'play' I waver and instead boot up Fallout 4 or even Skyrim again for another run through. Both of those games have advantages over Starfield including familiarity and the vast modding community of Skyrim as well as a much more fleshed out and robust gameplay system in Fallout 4

It's not that Starfield is bad, it's just that it isn't... well... all that fun. The base building is mediocre and absolutely pointless, whereas in Fallout 4 at least if I do things right settlers will arrive on their own and populate my settlements and I can establish ways to earn money or set up businesses to sell and buy items, and it seems like there are a hundred different play styles I can utilize through the perk tree. Whereas in Starfield it feels like half of the perk tree is mostly just useless even if I want to try something different

And ultimately the thing that will always leave a sour taste in my mouth concerning Starfield are the procedurally generated planets. Once you've trekked through a handful of planets and seen the dozen or so outpost styles the game has then you've basically seen everything Starfield has to offer. Sure there are unlimited planets or whatever, but ultimately those ""unlimited"" planets are all the exact same in the end

Basically if you go to Planet A and see Outpost Layout H, then later on you go to Planet Z and it happens to have Outpost Layout H, then you'll get the exact same story on a completely different planet. If OLH has a story where scientists were attacked by scary monsters and in room 1 you find a tape where Mr. Johnson gives his account of the monsters swarming them, you'll find the literal exact same tape on two different planets with the same Mr. Johnson tape in the exact same area

It was lazy design and means this ""vast"" game really isn't as big as the developers claim. I know Bethesda wanted to make Starfield the next big property but it sure doesn't seem like that's the case. 

To be nice to the game I will say the Spaceship creation is fairly in-depth, though the UI leaves a lot to be desired and it doesn't exactly explain things well.

Sidequests are very limited with no replay value. 
Large open spaces filled with procedurally generated nothing. 

Main issue is the story, 
the writing is bafflingly bad, from the characters to the story arc. It felt like there were some good ideas, but they never got implemented or were work-shopped out somewhere along the creation process. Characters are hollow simulacrums who exist purely to move the story along and will never once make you believe they are real thinking people. The main story hints at something grand, but then ends. It pretends to have more replay-ability but it's a lie. 

The entire game sortof has a Carl Sagan-esc 'wonder for wonders sake' feel. ""There is no story, and isn't that an amazing story?"" and it falls completely flat.

There are a limited range of planet designs so do not expect every planet to be different.  The main story planets are unique but the others are fairly barren save for some outposts with some people to fight with and a few other discoveries.

There is an excellent modding community with excellent additional weapons, outfits and even missions.  You do have to purchase credits in the Creations store which has been controversial but to be honest if you choose your content wisely you can get some good additional content for not much money.

Starfield,1716740,199075695,"If you're looking at the mixed/negative reviews, know this, I'm a decent way in the game and after each main quest you receive an achievement. After this last achievement, I noticed only 29% of players have received it meaning a majority of the haters for this game, haven't even dipped into the story or where things really pick up. Which also means a lot of people are just predisposed to hating on the game without giving it a chance or playing it through. Take it with a grain, but here is my review.

As someone who played at launch with over 150 hours on Xbox, I can clarify there's quite a bit to address here especially in recent times.

I have been playing Bethesda games since Fallout 3 around 2009 and have completed all titles stories. What sets this game apart from all of them has not only been the atmosphere, but the story itself. I know people say it's ""forgettable"" but honestly I've come to realize those people probably have never questioned the universe outside of religious aspects and more scientifically. This game does exactly that and if I were to TLDR the story without any spoilers, think the movie ""Interstellar"". Not to rip on Fallout or anything but to me it's the same song different dance in terms of a baby being involved whether it's you or your own, or being shot in the head and somehow waking up, they all just feel the same and honestly I found those stories much more forgettable because they relied so heavily on the ""believably sane"" option that could relate to almost anyone. What this story is, is much more, it can be applied to our universe and actually help us understand some of the great theories this universe has to offer. It's definitely a more hypothetical realistic approach which is risky knowing people would either love it or hate it, but I thought it was worth mentioning because even Elder Scrolls games we look at and immediately know it's fantasy, although with this title, you wonder if there is actual truth being told to a degree and really makes you wonder. It literally made me feel like a kid again with the amount of excitement this game still brings me.

Playing this game just coming out of a nasty marriage, extended months in rehab and mental in-patient stay's come to find out I'm disabled from schizoaffective, this was the first video game that actually held my attention in almost a decade and what has brought me back to gaming. I know there's also talk about POI's which I whole heartedly agree with. If you don't know, randomly procedural generated worlds are created each time you land somewhere on a planet, it doesn't matter how close you land to the previous landing, it will be entirely different yet consist of the same POI's just set out differently literally in a copy/paste fashion... On every planet. It took me 100 hours to figure this out and once I did, I slowly stopped playing the game and waited for a ""fix"" to this yet never was fixed. 

From what I can tell so far coming back to this game almost two years later, is that I kept getting this itch to play a Bethesda title, and re-dipped my feet in each one, yet it wasn't scratched. That I valued the story so much more in Starfield than the actual exploration and a lot of people do not understand the reason why there are so many loading screens, it has to do with the fact that each time you load into a different section of the game, it saves whatever tangible objects location is so that it will be exactly was as you left it. Meaning if I dropped a pear on one planet and decided a week later, in game or real life, to go back to where I put that pear, it would still be there. So with that being said, it explains the all the loading and helped me be more forgiving on the experience after learning this.

After many day's hovering over the purchase button for this game during the summer steam sale debating if I wanted to come back to this game knowing I NG+10 times in my Xbox playthorughs, that I would probably be sick of it by now. Although getting through the intro and seeing the constellation again, feeling the excitement of this being the beginning of a non NG+ playthrough hit home and took me back to the magical days of launch and the start to my journey as a father, a single father, and one that had to learn to live with a diagnosis. This game helped keep me stable until I went back into psychosis for three months last summer and was the only game I consistently felt like I looked forward to playing when times were rough. It literally kept me sane.

Buying the game again and replaying it knowing the outcomes to every questline, end game material, I actually am overwhelmed with joy to know I get to re-experience all of this because of how magical every moment of this story felt.

Yes it's very PG but you're in a group of fricken scientists, not gonks and chooms in cyberpunk (a game that was heavily compared to at launch). The PG aspect was actually a breath of fresh air because I went from a life of not having a single soul I could trust and only seeing people's worst sides, to something that reintroduced me to what ""normal"" and friendly people are mostly like. It retaught me morals in a way.

Needless to say, I'm rambling at this point. Basically what I'm trying to say is if you're looking for space exploration, go for No Man's Sky or Elite Dangerous, or even Starcitizen. If you're looking for engagement and progression, go for Starfield's story and if you're a big science geek like myself, you'll probably actually love the game. I've never played every questline in any other Bethesda title, although this is the first I actually enjoyed doing.

Lastly, just keep in mind what I said about copy/paste POI's and the same ones on different planets. Focus on the story, story lines, etc and when you get to end game, all i'm going to say is you haven't seen this in gaming before. Get it on sale or try it on Gamepass if you have it. But nothing has boggled my brain as much as this game and is the closest I can relate anything to being on the ""Interstellar"" level of questioning you will have by the end of this game.

Todd Howard and Bethesda, please don't abandon this game or series, there is still so much potential still here. Despite the absolute flaws, this is the only game I've ever actually purchased merch for.

Starfield,1716740,199064539,"Not one space game I played has the variety and freedom of this one, whether you want to kill stuff, build bases, pirate, do quests.... you can do it all.

Starfield,1716740,199059422,"I honestly don't know why Starfield has gotten such a bad rep. Is it an amazing game with an unforgettable story? No. But let's be realistic, it's a Bethesda game. We're not playing it for a life-changing narrative, we're playing it because it's fun. It's extremely similar to FO4, and I'm hard pressed to think of issues with this game that aren't present in FO4 as well. 

I'm a big sci-fi fan, and the role-playing aspect to this game definitely scratches an itch. The ship customization is fun, the character skill trees feel well-rounded and tailored to your game-play style (think of a mix between the fallout perk system and morrow wind's skill upgrades, in which you have to actually do the skill in order to level it up). Recent upgrades such as better local maps and adding earthbound vehicles have also been a huge improvement. The character models are pretty good too. 

Complaints about the emptiness of Starfield's world are sort of lost on me -- the plot will take you to interesting and varied locations. Landing on a random moon and expecting something other than moon dust is just not how this game is structured - there will be desolate, empty areas and there will be areas teeming with life/danger. You have the chance to explore both, and following along with the plot will take you to both. The varied gravity and assistance of a jet pack have also made for a unique play style that's really fun. The combat system is... fine. If you've been spoiled by games like Elden Ring, you will probably find it lackluster. I find the exploration aspect a lot more interesting than its combat. It's very typical Bethesda, but the upside is that there is a massive amount of difficulty customization that provides a fix for monotony.

The settlement system is lacking and feels like an afterthought. I would have really enjoyed something closer to fallout 4's system of building. Resource extraction had a chance to be meaningful, but it just feels useless in the game play itself -- not a great way to make money, and with not-very-interesting results. I love base-building but I've honestly skipped it in this game because there's just not much to do there.

There are some really memorable quests, and some quests that are fairly dumb/repetitive (honestly, reminding me a bit of Skyrim - a lot of lost potential in certain narratives and a lot of surprising content in others). The companions are fine, I found myself neither loving nor hating them; the factions also have a really decent history, but I did wish that there was more consequence for choosing to support one group over the other. The game allows you to be MANY things at once, and while that can be fun for having a lot of content in a single save, it can also make your choices feel inconsequential. 

So overall? It's fine! It's honestly a lot of fun if you're looking for a roleplay-focused space adventure. I don't regret my purchase, but I also wouldn't nominate it for any big prizes. Most of my defense for Starfield is out of surprise for how much people dislike it. I bought it on a whim expecting the worst, and actually had a pretty good time with it.

Starfield,1716740,198981359,"I'm surprised that I'm not mad at this game. I avoided it during release because I remember what Bethesda puts out, but I was hankering for some RPG gameplay regardless, so I picked it up.

There are genuinely cool moments. The big ticket fights with Terrormorphs stand out for me and with a little more fleshing out I honestly believe we could've seen Terrormorphs become a new icon of fiction, or at least gaming. 

Likewise, when you get it to work right, starship fights are pretty fun, as are micro-grav shootouts. It's clear that some effort was put into this game.

Emphasis on some, however...

This is a game that was worked on for the better part of a decade? I can't imagine what was left on the cutting room floor...

Factions, history, motivations...every aspect of world building is broken and only makes less sense the more you learn of it. I could go into detail, but there are video essays on the matter and, besides, it's basically every aspect of the game at this point, so please believe me.

Gameplay that is, at best, adequate. It doesn't stand out in any fashion, but it's just a reskin of everything we've seen from Bethesda for like 20 years now. I know I'm not breaking new ground saying this, but it is astounding the levels this company went to just spin its wheels and still manage to sound like it huff its own farts in press releases.

That's my biggest take from my time with the game, ultimately. Bethesda didn't take the time to humble itself. It didn't care how all aspects of the game worked together while the writers were clearly not talking to each other in either the story or quest departments.

Those are pretty big issues in a game about combat and roleplaying and I don't understand how a company that does nothing but that can manage to be so bad at it. Sure I had some fun, but it was mostly despite the game, not because of it.

I'm glad I experienced this, because one way or another it will be a landmark moment. I like what Bethesda can do, honest. I hope that this is their wake up call to go back to basics and focus on the fundamentals of the games they themselves make.

If you're going to make a shooter, make the shooting fun.

If you're going to make a story driven game, make the story engaging.

If you're going to make an RPG, make progression meaningful.

I wouldn't recommend Starfield. I only played it as RPG fast food. I was hungry and it was there. Yet, if this is the game the makes the developer step back and rethink how they make games, I'll be glad for it's existence. Though I doubt I'll ever touch this, again...",False,4,3760

The faction quests and designing my starship are easily my favorite parts. I’ve literally had to set alarms to stop myself from spending too much time upgrading my ship — it's that addictive. I also really appreciate how the traits and backgrounds influence dialogue. That’s a fresh addition for a Bethesda game and a step in a really exciting direction. 

That said, exploration can feel a bit empty at times. Surveying and cataloging creatures isn’t really my thing, but if that's the kind of roleplay you enjoy, there’s definitely something there for you.

I don’t think it makes sense to spend hundreds of hours in a game and walk away saying, “It’s alright.” Some characters are deeply fleshed out, others are more background — but that’s par for the course in a game of this scale.

Pro's
-I love the vast worlds and making outposts. Tweaking everything so I can make supply lines and ways to make credits. 
-The story is new and interesting. The concept is mind bendingly complex. There are so many different branches the story could take in the future and that excites me. 
-Ship building to make my own spaceship and decorating it.
-Some of the quests have actually made me emotional.
-I still discover new things on new playthroughs.
-The background and traits help me feel like I am really in character.
-Chunks. Period.
-The views are stunning. I love going to other planets and moons as if it were real life. Exploring and seeing different stars or how the sky looks on each and every celestial body. 
-The times being correct on each place you visit. And it is relative to the rest of the universe. I think that was really cool. 

Con's 
-Crowds look like sims townies but worse. 
-The lipsync gives the uncanny valley effect. I cannot stand how they move their mouths. Looks hella weird.
-The BLOAT on the saves. I have never had a game autosave so much. I even turned off the autosave except for once per hour on pause. And it still saves more than I want. 
-The LOADING SCREENS. There are WAY too many. Docking and undocking really could be less time consuming.
-It's almost impossible to be a ""bad guy."" I wish there were more endings, more shady characters and just more bad guy stuff!! There isn't really a morally gray character in this. It's either good or bad. If Delgado was a romance companion, THAT would have been awesome! 
-Nothing in this game is fem or masc. It's all so androgynous. Am I saying having those options is a bad thing? No. But it is too gender neutral. I love feminine clothing and armor. And the selection for that is just near to nothing.
-Lastly, I wish there were actually choices to change the story line, as a whole. There is really only one end and one beginning. Yes, the story is fun and exciting. But compared to games like BG3, it just makes it difficult to make any REAL game altering choices.

Perhaps they were expecting a space sim like Elite or the X series, but instead they got an RPG. The game is like a mix of Alien: Isolation and Deus Ex: Human Revolution with smattering of Mass Effect and No Man's Sky thrown in. Of course it is a Bethesda RPG, so just like Skyrim, it requires several mods to address the shortcomings. And it does have some weird performance anomalies. I have a mid-range system and will normally get 40-50 FPS on low-medium settings (which still looks good btw) but sometimes the game will just randomly drop to 8-10 FPS and look like crap. I can usually fix this by going into my inventory or talking to an NPC, but not always. I am running several mods and don't really know if this happens in vanilla. Another issue is the seemingly deliberate bland-looking NPCs that populate the game. The character creator has a lot of variety and allows for some great-looking characters, but some of the NPCs (mostly the generic ""crowd"" people wandering around the populated areas) seem to have been deliberately made to look, well, ugly. The other thing that is kind of mediocre is the dialog and overall pacing of the conversations. But I thought the exact same of the dialog in Skyrim and Oblivion. So don't expect the wit of Mass Effect 1-3 (IMO, Mass Effect Andromeda also had some lackluster dialog). The over-arching story-line seems to be a mashup of Skyrim, Mass Effect Andromeda, and No Man's Sky. It hasn't yet given me the ""wow"" factor and I don't know if it ever will.

Starfield,1716740,198740910,"This game is what Fallout 4 was to Skyrim. It is a backward evolution of all the story and world structure, mechanics and quest design from the previous games, to a point where all that is left is a watered down spectacle theme park that strings out mildly engaging moments across as much gratification delay as it possibly can.

Ignoring all the technical issues with the game, Starfield presents story tropes that are nowadays overdone and mashes them with their old cliche Dragonborn-learn-shout kind of gameplay loop. It's not necessarily the worst idea in the world, as it worked pretty well in Skyrim and we lacked a similar feeling in Fallout 4, but Starfield they did it in the most cringey way possible, and when you come across it, it's rather blatant and eye-roll worthy. The narrative is lowkey and the dialogue is wooden, and there's next to no interplay with animations or music employed to enhance the emotions of particular encounters, making the whole activity of making choices and talking to characters a chore.

Settlement building makes a return, but is rather pointless other than to fill a checkbox of mechanics to put in an otherwise empty game. Any purpose the mechanic serves is overshadowed by other mechanics - you don't need to setup automated mining, for you can just run around a planet with a laser drill for a few minutes and find the resources you need, or buy it at a vendor, if they even have enough money or items for a worthwhile trade. They added a whole spaceship building system, but they implemented just the bare minimum, not thinking about what players would actually want to do with their ships - you can place room modules of various shapes, sizes and types, but you can't really decide where you want doors between them to be (apparently you sort of can but it's 50/50). You also can't place furniture in your ship like you would in a settlement or house as the interiors are pre-modelled.

The sound design and music of this game is perhaps poor if you've heard everything from Fallout 4. I'm unsure if it was the creative direction or due to the range of the composer, but the music in this game just sounds like more Fallout 4, rather than its own thing, other than a few 'theme' pieces. There were many times that I was looting an interior cell and heard some music and felt like I was getting flashbacks to looting train stations and bathrooms in Fallout 4 that I had to step back and do a double take. There are also a lot of reused sound effects in this game from both Fallout 4 and Skyrim, which is really jarring when you're familiar with both games and noticing it pulls you out of the experience.

Taking the lazy route, Bethesda decided to maintain the current cell-based structure of their famous Creation Engine and didn't even bother to innovate upon its world streaming capabilities, leaving a size-limited playing field with a rather unimmersive invisible wall at its edges of the procedurally generated planetsides that forces you to turn around or leave the planet and pick another arbitrary spot to land on. This wouldn't be so bad if the new (and admittedly impressive) terrain-blending feature of the procedural world generator had been given enough hand-authored POIs to actually distribute on the planets, but Bethesda only decided to make a couple dozen different structure types and called it a day. Not even adding new POIs through post-launch updates or even sprinkling some smaller DLCs were on Bethesda's plate.

I would not recommend this game. Even on a sale, you'd be better off watching some YouTube gameplay for a couple of hours and you'll have seen almost everything this game has to offer. And that really hurts me to say, because I love Skyrim so much (still mod it to death to this day, 7500+ mods and counting), so much so that I pre-ordered the Premium offer for Starfield.

Starfield,1716740,198685016," Starfield delivers an expansive, immersive space-faring RPG that both longtime Bethesda fans and newcomers will find hard to put down. Here’s a breakdown of what makes it shine—and a couple of areas where there’s room for improvement:

Storyline
From your humble beginnings as a member of Constellation—the last group of space explorers—Starfield weaves a narrative that’s both grand in scope and surprisingly personal. The main quest chain takes you across meticulously crafted planets, through political intrigues between the United Colonies and Freestar Collective, and into uncharted mysteries lurking beyond known space. Subplots involving mercenary work, corporate espionage, and archaeological digs add layers of depth that keep you invested in your character’s journey.

Gameplay
At its core, Starfield nails that signature Bethesda blend of freedom and emergent storytelling. Whether you’re negotiating with a space station’s governor, sneaking through an abandoned facility, or dogfighting Bandit ships in zero-G, the game consistently rewards creative solutions. Ship customization feels robust without being overwhelming—you can swap components, upgrade weapons, and even paint your vessel to your heart’s content. Ground combat takes inspiration from modern FPS design, with satisfying gunplay and the occasional strategic pause to manage health and special abilities.

Adventure & Exploration
Exploration is Starfield’s beating heart. With over 1,000 star systems and more than 100 explorable planets, you’ll encounter everything from lush alien jungles to rusting industrial wastelands. Random encounters—like distress signals, ancient ruins, or pirate ambushes—mean that even a routine supply run can turn into a memorable side quest. Scanning planets for resources, cataloging alien flora and fauna, and establishing outposts all feed your sense of discovery.

Downsides
No game is perfect, and Starfield’s two most noticeable rough spots are outpost development and game balance early on. Building and managing outposts is a neat idea in theory, but the interface can be clunky, and resource logistics quickly become tedious unless you’re deeply committed to base-building. Additionally, some weapon mods and powerful gear unlock far too early, making certain firefights feel trivial—and robbing the midgame of its challenge.

Balancing with Mods
Thankfully, the vibrant modding community has already stepped in to smooth those edges. Balance-overhaul mods adjust weapon and enemy scaling, ensuring that you’re never steamrolling every encounter simply because you picked up a Legendary Plasma Rifle on your first planet. Other quality‑of‑life mods refine the outpost UI, streamline resource transfers, and even expand building options.",True,2,12891

Starfield,1716740,198671087,"I really wanted to like this game, and when I beat the game I just felt empty. While I had fun with the combat and ship building, you can only explore the same, reused location on a totally different planet so many times.

• Over 90% of planets you explore are dead and for the most part not worth exploring. (Was it so dead and empty so you could build settlements to make it ""feel"" more alive? Was that the plan?)

• Leveling skills is a chore and not fun. 

• The main companions are trash and EVERY single one of the has an issue if you're evil or chose the more aggressive options. Always complaining about every little thing you do. Best thing you can do with them, leave them behind if you don't want to be nagged for everything you do. I REALLY wanted to do a Hunter playthough, but no, all companions are protected. There was a twist half way through the game where something happens to the one you spent the most time with and I couldn't care less. 

• The Hunter, honestly the best character in the game and the correct character to side with when you can.

• The ""Powers"". They're trash and can only be upgraded through many playthoughs. You can play but never need to use them due to how weak they are at the start. These only become useful if you plan to play through the game multiple times. 

• The ship building is fun and I really enjoyed it. Ship combat, once you have a decent ship is also really fun. Though at some point you can just sit there and destroy everything on screen with the upgrades and weapons.

• IT IS NOT worth doing a second playthrough if you have weapons and ships you liked, as you lose EVERYTHING when you start a new game+, with no way of saving ship blueprints for easy building or a weapons cache that can save at least a few of them. 9 times out of 10 the items it starts you with will be worse than your current gear and ship, which is a huge loss. 

• When they updated it to add the Creation Club stuff, it shows I have the DLC, I can't access it no matter what I do. Also, every single one of my files have been marked as modded, even though I never used any mod or outside tool as I was achievement hunting at the time, so achievements are locked, even on my oldest save which was done back at the start of the game AND when I tried to make a new game.

• They added a buggy so you can now explore the barren planets faster... Yay?

Bethesda Isn't for the ""Woke"" and Doesn't Back down on their Agenda. they Promised something, and Haven't stepped down from that. Starfield Isn't for the Younger Generation, Nor is it for those who don't have a Passion for Freedom Perspective. i mean, Yes without Modders it is missing quite a lot, And aside from the 'Very Vanilla Storyline' There isn't much to do aside from 'Repeatable Missions on Repeatable POIs"". But it still has that Bethesda Flavor, that i remember playing on Morrowind. Yes, I know. 'The engine is ancient, and people don't like that stuff anymore' I am sorry, not sorry - Morrowind is the Greatest Game that ever released. Games like The Witcher(aside from the Novel), Bulder's Gate , were inspired by Morrowind. Before you go on to say 'They are it's Succussor'. while it may be true, Starfield is also that too.

-Gunplay is smooth and plays like a typical generic FPS game from 10 or 15 years ago.
-Ship customization is a highlight, your ship is effectively your home and where you will spend a lot of time.
-A lot of miscellaneous items have detailed models that can be fun to look at once or twice.

[b]Negatives[/b]
- A Solid State Drive is a requirement, if you do not have a Solid State Drive, this game will literally break in the weirdest and most unfun ways possible.

-There is little to no lore. Leaving you with very little to actually imagine or interact with in any meaningful or interesting way. This game is basically just a FPS sandbox for you to fight generic space pirates in.

-The story is barely there, with the grand arching narrative being: [spoiler]Getting to New Game Plus so you can then immediately speedrun to New Game Plus again.[/spoiler]

-The game disincentivizes you from playing as a pirate, thief, or smuggler by putting you into extreme amounts of XP debt, effectively bricking your character's progression by requiring you to grind hundreds of thousands of points to be able to even consider leveling up again.

-Settlements are genuinely a waste of time and require way to much grinding, resource gathering, credits, and time to actually make it worth doing. It is quite literally easier to just go and buy whatever resources you need for crafting from NPC vendors. [spoiler]Also new game plus completely erases your settlements, so save yourself the trouble and do not bother interacting with this mechanic.[/spoiler]

-Major spoiler: [spoiler] The entire goal of the game being to get to New Game Plus effectively robs the story, characters, and actions of the player of any and all weight, making it very difficult to remain immersed or invested in the borderline non-existent story of the game to begin with.[/spoiler]

The world of Starfield is one that feels very barren and desolate. With very little story, with very little lore, with things that could remotely be considered being living breathing settlements being far and few between.

Starfield is little more than a sandbox FPS ""RPG"" with a story shoe horned in because hard-grinding XP by running around as a murder hobo killing generic space pirates for the sole purpose of leveling up and getting a perk that lets you do 2.5% more damage with pistols is not a very good long-term motivator.

Ship building is cool and ship combat can be entertaining, ultimately your ship is effectively your primary home and where you will spend a lot of time just crafting, doing inventory management, and flying to new planets to repeat your murder hobo routine until you can manage to level up again. It can be genuinely enjoyable trying to customize and make your ship your own.

Many planets have smaller cities with missions that send you around space to explore.

Starfield,1716740,198483683,"TLDR; vanilla Starfield 6/10, modded Starfield 8/10 a flawed and sometimes boring game, that has a magic that grabs onto a few

After putting over 300 hours on this game figured I'd buy the steam version. To be honest it's a flawed game, but there is still a magic in there. That sentence is considering mods, as for the vanilla experience it's just way too under baked. Mods make this a worthwhile experience, and along with some creations like Watchtower it really brings the experience closer to what it should have been. 

The biggest flaws would be a lack of planet to planet space exploration, I personally don't think atmosphere flight matters or would change the core experience whereas being able to fly from planet to planet in a single star system with encounters such as derelict ships or fleet battles occurring as you fly would have enriched the gameplay flow. That's not what this game is though, it has alot of loading screens but if you have a good system they're basically negligible being under 1-2 seconds with more improvements to GPUs and the such if you choose to hold off on playing this, the experience will only get better with time when you choose to upgrade. For the average person though this won't apply, you'll most likely deal with 5-10 second loading screens back to back all within moments of each other, completely changing the experience from something that's hardly noticeable to something that completely ruins the game for you. 

The POI system also is terrible in the vanilla experience. The biggest issue with it is the lack of variety and an absolute NEED for a larger pool of choices to draw from for this type of game. You'll encounter POIs from the main quest while you're out exploring, or repeats of the same one right next to each other. The only way around this is with mods, which completely improves the experience but is a critical flaw of the game. There will be long periods of time where you're playing this game and essentially doing chore work, such as looting a dungeon can take you 15+ minutes just slowly scanning the room for loot. 

The repeatable radiant quests are braindead, simple, and usually only one step that tend to consist of you going through several loading screens to kill a single enemy, or loot a specific chest. A common theme with this game is that mods greatly improve this experience, mods that increase the payout for these quests, or even add more depth to them. Too many of the systems feel barebones such as the food/drink survival system that are improved with mods. Mods, mods, mods. You get the picture yet? 

With all the criticism I've brought up I still really enjoy playing this game. It has an interesting endgame, it feels like that's when everything really begins. Jumping through the NG+ multiple times, starting from nothing, and trying to build it all back up again is super fun especially with hardcore mechanics added to the experience with mods. Having to manage your fuel, crew morale, etc, adds layers to the systems that makes it a more rewarding experience, while making radiant missions more important when every credit has more worth to it. Plus with paid creations people are making new content at higher quality. 

Unfortunately that's just the name of the game now, I know there are still deniers thinking it won't be in ES6 but that's how Starfield stays fresh. New content coming from mods and creations. So if I ask myself do I think Starfield is worth $70? No. Not the base vanilla game atleast. Do I think Starfield + Shattered Space + Watchtower + mods + free creations is worth $70? Yes. The modded experience is definitely worth it, but it comes with many caveats and it'll be up to your subjective opinion on the story and world building. 

For me it's alot of good ideas but poor execution. Most of the interesting stuff in the lore happened in the past, and the time period in which you play is relatively at ""peace"" which makes things less tense and lack of conflict in the story. Though I personally find the metanarrative stuff with the NG+ very fascinating to think about. 

I know I said a lot to basically say nothing, but Starfield is an incredibly well made but boring game in it's base form that comes alive when heavily modded and with more content. To make Starfield probably the best space RPG in my opinion is to just add more variety to the POI system, make it more modular and randomized (enemies, loot placement, room layout, etc) and make space exploration more fleshed out. If there are a pool of 90 POIs the game pulls from, it realistically needs to be something like 200 POIs that can be further randomized to make it feel like a truly huge 1000+ planets game world. 

Basically this is Bethesda's modern attempt at Daggerfall, and I personally really like Daggerfall! I started playing Bethesda games with Oblivion and went backwards to Daggerfall and grew a deep appreciation for it but there's just not enough content that's required to live up to it's potential. That same sentence rings true for Starfield. Regardless, there is a magic in exploring, looting, building outposts, hunting down bounties, or whatever. I personally have more desire to play this than Fallout 4 because the RPG mechanics are deeper, even if they're not that crazy deep.",True,5,2554

When I first jumped into Starfield, I'll be honest – it was a bit of a struggle. The sheer number of game mechanics felt overwhelming, and it took me several hours to really start liking the game. I was slogging through the initial quests, trying to wrap my head around everything, and wondering if this game was truly for me.

Then something clicked. I decided to wander off from the main story, and that's when the real fun began. I stumbled upon the Space Ranger storyline, and suddenly, the galaxy opened up. This side questline truly showcased what Starfield can be, and it completely changed my perspective.

Now, 30 hours in, I'm absolutely hooked. Sure, it's not perfect – I've encountered some minor bugs here and there, and the visuals can sometimes look a bit washed out, especially in caves. But these minor gripes are easily overshadowed by the sheer enjoyment I'm getting.

The side storylines are fantastic, offering so much depth and variety beyond the main quest. And both the ground and space combat are incredibly fun and engaging. Exploring new planets, building my ship, and getting lost in the various factions has been an absolute blast.

Buried under a galaxy of loading screens, carbon-copy outposts, and NPCs with the emotional range of a screensaver lies Bethesda’s grand illusion of exploration. The ships take off but the wonder never does.

Exploring Starfield’s planets feels like navigating a PowerPoint deck. The dialogue system tries to branch but mostly stutters, and the inventory micromanagement deserves its own MBA course.

Sure, it’s massive. Sure, it’s in space. But when every planet blurs into the next, all that scale just amplifies the emptiness.

Is the story or side stories the best of a generation or MUST SEE content? Well no, but the main story and faction quests are generally above average. The idea is unique and is certainly worth playing through.

You can build outposts, connect them together such that cargo ships transfer resources from one to another -- think of multiple sites mining resources and shipping them to other outposts set-up for manufacturing.

I feel like I’m the kind of person Starfield was made for. I loved Bethesda’s last single-player RPG, Fallout 4 (maybe a bit too much), and there’s nothing I like more than a sci-fi universe with spaceships, lasers, and political intrigue flying every which way. And yet, a dozen hours into Starfield, I was feeling lost in space. Things never went too far off course while I was flying my rinkydink little ship around chasing down mysterious artifacts and war criminals with a damn fine crew of companions at my side, but man did Starfield make me work hard to get through that opening stretch. Even when it mostly righted the ship and I was loving the story, sidequests, and launching boarding parties on enemy ships, there were still too many problems that constantly popped up, forcing me to curb my excitement. It’s a bit like Starfield’s own elaborate shipbuilder tool: even though you can slap a bunch of high-end parts together and it will technically fly, sometimes it’s just not the best fit.

I would expect no less: Bethesda has built out a sprawling universe with detailed lore in which humanity has left Earth behind and colonized the galaxy, but hasn’t made first contact with sentient aliens as of the 24th century. It’s chock-full of backstory about wars between its three major factions, run-ins with mysterious space deathclaws called terrormorphs, pirates, and an immense amount more. I wouldn’t call a lot of it especially distinctive – it’s a setting that’s reminiscent of The Expanse, Firefly, and Starship Troopers, full of references to every sci-fi movie from Aliens to Blade Runner, and of course Interstellar. There’s even a fair bit of Indiana Jones influence as it sends you on a treasure hunt to collect mysterious artifacts. In fact, there’s a significant similarity to what Obsidian created for 2019’s The Outer Worlds. But it’s so densely packed in, with more stories around every corner, that I found it easy to get invested in it – once I learned the difference between the United Colonies and the Freestar Collective.

Creating your character is a matter of picking a background story for them that comes with a set of skills and traits, as well as up to three modifiers. It’s always a bit tough to choose this on your first playthrough, since you don’t really know what you’re getting into and there’s no respecing allowed, but none of them is dramatic enough to really hinder you. Some – like the one where your parents are alive and well (if you don’t pick this they just never come up), or the one where a crazed fan follows you around – sound like they’ll be fun to experiment with later, which adds a sense of replayability.

After that, while everyone starts out in the same mining camp and touches the same space magic that sets off a trippy 2001: A Space Odyssey-style vision, Starfield is an immense game that will send you off in all kinds of different directions once it hands you the keys to your first spaceship. It’s to the point where talking to others who played alongside me left us all bewildered and asking questions like:

“Wait, what do you mean you don’t know who the Vanguard are?”


“How did you not meet this person?”


“How are you crafting those weapon mods already?”


“Wow, you didn’t unlock [REDACTED] until level 20?”


“What the heck even is a Va’Ruun?”


“You met who in a bar?”


“Where did you find that ship?”[/b]

Starfield,1716740,198260364,"Where to even start. 

I have well over 3500 hours in fallout 4. I am an experienced modder (LittleWolf99 on Nexus) in that particular game and have a good understanding of how Bethesda's games work. 

This game is Horrible. I do not say this lightly. I have an extremely high tolerance for Bethesda's Species of bugs and Bad story telling but this game takes the cake, throws it on the floor, and dances on in. 

Problem #1 and the only reason im not going to press on. I have a weaker system (AMD 3600 with a GTX1080) nothing speical but i have always been able to play in 1440p usually with high or max settings in every game I play (#1 being FO4 i have it beyond maxxed. Also, Cyberpunk at 1440p medium, GTa 5 Maxxed, Red Dead 2 1440p medium and high plus countless other ""AAA"" quality tier games, This is the ONLY game i can not get to run in 1440p at more than 15-20fps.

The settings are fundamentally broken. you have to choose between full screen but maximum resolution (i use a 4k Monitor) or your game will not be full screen no matter what you do. This is Plain unacceptable. These are basic settings every game under the sun should have and this game does not have functioning Display settings. WOW.

Next up, the story. Its dog water. If you need specifics watch ANY Youtube video on it. I can stomach it, but most cant and shouldnt.

The mechanics, they all feel wrong. This is coming from recently spending 200+ hours In Elite Dangerous and even the FPS mechanics in that game feel WAAAAY better and I dont personally like them either. 

The art style is okay, but the NPC models look atrocious. I'm no stranger to needing mods to make the NPC characters not so ugly but HOLY COW they look BAD and the classic Dialog camera style makes this way more pronounced than it should have been.

I didnt get far due to the Unplayable Settings issues, but what I did play was not fun at all and I was not pulled into the world in a way that made me invested in what was happening. The intro makes no sense and feels really disjointed and forced.

This game seems like its got decent bones. Maybe if modders stripped the entire main story and made the game more of a sandbox it might be more fun but even then im not sure the game has the tools to build actual enjoyable game loops without a MASSIVE rework that would warrent a standalone new game no shackled by an aging game engine and a profit hungry shell of a formally Great game developer.

 Truly sad to see this mess first hand after watching so many bad reviews hoping I was that small percent of Bethesda fans that would actually enjoy the game.

PS this game is so buggy the Store page even bugged out my steam client. I hovered over a DLC and the pop up window WOULD NOT go away even after exiting store and going to other tabs. had to force shut down steam cuz the pop up was in the way of the settings in the top left.

Starfield,1716740,198153538,"With the Summer Sale coming soon, I figured I should leave a review prior to this game possibly going on sale. I can't recommend this game. It feels weird to say that as I've put 120 hours into the game, and I felt like I was having fun while I played it. But at the end of it all, looking back, I've drawn the conclusion that I was having fun because I WANTED to enjoy it. Not because I WAS enjoying it. If you're looking to get into the world of Bethesda games, I believe Fallout 4 is probably their best experience, and if that setting doesn't attract you, Skyrim is also a choice. If you're more attracted to the Space RPG aspect of Starfield, I'd recommend Mass Effect. All 3 of those games are likely on sale for a fair price. And all 3 of those games offer a better experience, in my opinion, than Starfield.

What it does well, does in no way outweigh the intense mediocrity that is the rest of the game. The exploration is not fun, if you can consider it present. You fast travel to planets, to fast travel to the surface, which is just a large, vastly empty zone, filled with things that you'll have seen in your first 5 planets. During your time exploring, the feature you'll get most acclimated to are the loading screens. This offers a great reason to practice with the Photo Mode as screenshots can show up as loading screens (not a complaint, actually nice). The combat is serviceable. The RPG elements are a step in the right direction with character backgrounds and traits, as well as skill based dialogue checks making a return. Visually pleasant. I didn't get an uncanny feeling, though going forward a more stylized focus would help. Starfield, I believe can not be salvaged. I think the world can be used again, and hopefully to greater success. But no amount of updates or mods can fix this fundamentally unfun game.",False,7,7295

* The ship building and combat is pretty cool, but tying unlocks to a mix of player level, missions, perks and location just makes it kind of confusing to build the ship you want to.
* The level up system is a cool evolution from Fallout 4 - having challenges to make you use the skill the way you do in Skyrim is a great blend of the two systems.  Melee combat is worst than either Skyrim or Fallout 4, and a bunch of the skills aren't really worth engaging with.
* Like Stealth.  It doesn't seem to ever work - you can be alone in a room with a closed door and have a fully clear room between you and anyone else and it'll still say you're detected (and that's with max Stealth perks).
* Crafting is kind of pointless because weapons are inexplicably levelled - you put a bunch of mods into a pistol just to find an identical one that does more damage because you just hit level 20.  Better of regularly replacing weapons with loot as you level.
* The jetpack feels good, and the variety of planetary biomes, gravity and features is cool, but there's no reason to actually explore planets.
* The space powers are mostly worse versions of Dragon Shouts, so I ended up using nothing but the life sensing one.

At launch the performance was atrocious, and after two years of waiting for updates and upgrading my PC, only now it's somewhat bearable. Occasional freezing does still occur both indoors and outdoors, despite being installed on an SSD.

After 18 hours, most of which were spent trying to get the damn thing to work, i haven't had the chance to actually get to play it aside from a few quests and seeing New Atlantis at an astonishing 20 FPS. Haven't gotten very far in exploring  but most of the worlds i have visited are exactly the same, barren and lifeless with an outpost or two.

To put it briefly, the game is boring and lackluster.

If this was a fantasy setting i might be able to look past it, One day you're a dusty miner working for minimum wage at the edge of space and suddenly you're given a ship and expected to know how to use it.

Starfield,1716740,198083500,"After years of hype, Starfield finally landed as Bethesda’s first brand-new universe in over two decades, promising an epic space-faring RPG with the studio’s trademark freedom and storytelling.

The result? A sprawling, ambitious journey through the stars that mostly delivers on exploration and scope, but occasionally stumbles under the weight of its own vastness and some rough edges inherited from Bethesda’s classic open-world formula.

Set in the 24th century, Starfield invites players to become a member of the “Constellation,” a group of space explorers chasing mysteries among over 100 star systems and hundreds of procedurally and hand-crafted planets.

The narrative centers around a conspiracy tied to ancient alien technology and interstellar politics—a classic sci-fi trope with some surprisingly nuanced moments and memorable characters. The voice acting and writing show real care, making you invested in your crew and missions.

While the main story isn’t revolutionary, it’s a solid foundation layered with countless side quests, faction rivalries, and world-building details that encourage curiosity.

Exploration is Starfield’s heart and soul. Flying between planets and landing on diverse worlds feels thrilling. The planetary surfaces vary from lush forests to barren wastelands, alien deserts, and ice-covered moons.

Planets often feature hidden caves, outposts, ancient ruins, and resource nodes to discover. Mining and crafting are surprisingly deep, letting you gather materials for ship upgrades, base building, and trading.

However, not all planets feel equally alive. Some can get repetitive, especially with similar flora, fauna, or quests scattered across them. The procedural generation is impressive but sometimes lacks the handcrafted polish of Bethesda’s terrestrial environments.

Piloting your spaceship between stars is a highlight. The cockpit UI is intuitive, and space travel has a satisfying sense of scale and momentum. Ship customization is extensive—you can upgrade weapons, engines, shields, and interior modules.

Combat comes in two flavors: on-foot and space battles. On-foot gunplay is serviceable—solid but not groundbreaking—with a mix of firearms, grenades, and gadgets. Space combat is more tactical and can be intense, especially during faction skirmishes.

Still, combat encounters occasionally feel repetitive, and enemy AI can be predictable.

Character progression is classic Bethesda RPG: a skill and perk system offering flexibility to create everything from stealthy explorers to heavy combat specialists.

Ship and base-building add layers of personalization. Your starship truly feels like home as you upgrade and customize it, while your outposts act as strategic hubs.

The crafting system is robust but can sometimes feel grindy, especially early on, as resource gathering becomes a frequent chore.

Graphically, Starfield is impressive with detailed planetary vistas, sleek ship designs, and atmospheric lighting. Spacewalks and planetary landings feel immersive.

Performance-wise, it’s mostly smooth on PC and current-gen consoles, though occasional bugs and frame dips persist—Bethesda staples that are likely to improve with patches.

Room to Grow:
-Planet variety can feel uneven after dozens of hours
-Side quests sometimes lack depth, feeling like busywork
-Combat mechanics are solid but not innovative
-Bugs and glitches—some humorous, some frustrating—still occur
-Multiplayer or co-op features are absent, which some players hoped for

Starfield is a bold, sprawling RPG that captures the thrill of space exploration with the familiar warmth of Bethesda’s storytelling and world-building. While it doesn’t revolutionize the genre, it offers a massive sandbox full of discovery, customization, and quiet moments under alien skies.

For fans of sci-fi RPGs and open-world adventures, Starfield is a must-play—even if it’s not without flaws. It’s a stellar launchpad for Bethesda’s vision of the future, with exciting potential for expansions and updates.

Pros:
-Vast, explorable star systems and planets
-Deep ship customization and space travel mechanics
-Engaging factions and story threads
-Robust character and base-building systems
-Beautiful vistas and immersive sci-fi atmosphere

Cons:
-Planetary environments can feel repetitive
-Combat and quests occasionally stale
-Bugs and performance hiccups remain
-Lack of multiplayer/co-op
-Crafting can become grind-heavy

Starfield invites you to chase the stars, explore the unknown, and carve your own cosmic legend. It’s not perfect, but it’s a thrilling new frontier worth charting.

Ship design? Okay, okay—I'll give them that. It's fun. But it's like Bethesda gave you a beautiful LEGO spaceship and said, “Aight, now park it forever and never use it for anything cool. You don’t fly—you fast travel.”
What kind of space game punks out of actual space travel?! This ain’t No Man’s Sky, it’s No Damn Game.

And the companions? Bruh. They got the charisma of DMV employees on Ambien. Every time I said something remotely spicy, Sarah Morgan’s like, “I’m disappointed in you.” Girl, I’m disappointed in YOU—for thinking this was gonna be fun.

Bethesda promised us the stars. Instead, they handed us a galaxy-sized PowerPoint presentation about missed opportunities. You know it’s bad when modders got more passion for this universe than the developers did.

Final Verdict:
I came for “Skyrim in Space.”
I got “PowerPoint in a vacuum.”",False,13,5055

Graphically it's pretty middle of the road. Gameplay wise it's exactly what you'd expect from a company like Bethesda the most accurate description I could give you would be they took fallout 4 and slapped a space skin on it which if you like then this is the game for you but for me I was not a huge fan of fallout 4 mainly because of the park system and they took the park system from fallout 4 and turned it up to 10. Every single aspect of this game is locked behind a perk and it's not just a single perk there's multiple points you need in that perk in order to play the game the way you want to. Performance wise it's not very good at least not on PC there are some areas that it runs well and some areas that it runs very poorly.

Unfortunately the game is a literal chore to play, i installed day one and set to playing it. OMG i have never been so unhappy with a purchase since day one release of no mans sky. it takes FOR EVER to do anything in this game, enemy's are bullet sponges, i use entire stacks of ammo for every encounter, when i decided to go for melee 3 strikes then you must wait to attack again, barf. when i want to run it better not be for anymore than 5 seconds because you are winded from that and must wait even longer to re-gen ""stamina"". every time i take off or un-dock cutscene, get up from my pilots seat, cutscene. in the middle of a firefight in the ship and accidently fat finger the stand up button? guess what now you get to watch a cutscene while enemy ships maul you. You want to do anything? guess what its on the other side of a different system, cutscene after a charge of the warp system, then you have to fly around that system to get where you want to go (new cutscene). ah now you have landed at the place you needed to go? now walk for 5 min in some crappy place, transition to different areas 5 times and wallah theres the guy you need to talk to, better hope they erent in the middle of standing up because you have to wait for them to figure that out before talking. OK no you have talked to them? good now go to a different system, watch 20 cutscenes land on some lame place fight the lame enemys that just stand there and shoot at you in the open, with 900 bullets, then you can succeed in the mission and have it completed right? WRONG! now you have to go to some other g o d forsaken place and do it again. also wtf Game devs if i have to follow some wanker around AT LEAST MAKE THEIR WALK SPEED THE SAME AS MINE!!
im either waiting for someone to catch up or im chasing after them because my walk speed is only 2/3 of theirs.

In Starfield you can't get anywhere without opening a map selecting a location and holding fast travel. And the map is super clunky between ground, orbit, system and galaxy. Youre constantly cycling through them to get to the one you need.

In Skyrim you could get from Riften to Solitude by just pointing in that direction and holding ""W"" with encounters and towns on the way. This is the same with every Bethesda games. With a space game. I feel like this experience is even more critical and yet starfield is the only game where you can't do that.

Also, The pipboy in fallout allowed you to look at the map without breaking immersion. I don't know why they didn't carry that over here.

It's easy to compare this to something like No Man's Sky or something along those lines, but this is a Bethesda game through and through. The closer comparison, in my opinion, is something like Fallout in space. Obviously not a 1 to 1 comparison, but still much more accurate than No Man's Sky, I think. Are there a lot of loading screens? Yes, but if you're a Bethesda fan, this ain't your first rodeo. If you've never played a Bethesda open-world RPG, the mechanics may sometimes feel slightly dated (although, I think that jet packs mixed with mantling and combat slides, have made combat feel much more fresh). If you've never enjoyed Bethesda's take on RPGs, this won't change your mind. However, if you ARE a Bethesda open-world RPG fan. If you have loved sinking your time in the Elder Scrolls Oblivion or Skyrim or if you've enjoyed the Fallout games since Bethesda has taken over, you most likely will enjoy this game. Just keep an open mind, although I've drawn comparisons to Oblivion, Skyrim and Fallout, this is not those games but the DNA is most certainly there. I hope this helps someone gain a realistic expectation for this product, before purchasing it.

Starfield,1716740,197616469,"I had so many prejudices against this game, and I sided with many that were bashing against it online,  even though I never played it, and just judged from what I saw in videos and reviews. -  Also  from experience of Bethesda games.

Now I played a bit, and I can now wholeheartely honestly say, I don't recommend it.

The skill-system is inferior to any Bethesda game. They tried something different, and failed.
Same with character creation.

Walking speed is still immensively  slower than those of NPCs,  so you either have to switch between walking and running, or you just ran around in circles or  wait for NPCs if you have to ""follow"" them.

Initiating conversations is extremly annoying, because it you constantly have to wait for the conversation to actually start, sometimes feels like  5-10 seconds... that way too long.

Persuasion is some random untransparent feature, as you get green, yellow and red options, showing the difficulty to success, but how high the chances actually are? Nobody knows. You'll find people online complaining how they fail and succeed green and red options about the same, while red options give you  more  points to the  overall persuasion challenge's points.

And while the idea might be not too bad, it also depends on HOW you argue in those pesuasion  options,  so you can either manage to skip some questionable quest objectives,  or you can just get better rewards, but that's not necessarily clear when you  pick those options,  which is why the implementation of that idea is just so immensively bad.

Companions dislike hearing you agreeing to do something they don't like, even if you don't actually follow through, OR if you  can only presuade them to  skip that part AFTER you agreed. So, if you wanna  finish the quest, without doing dubious stuff, you first have to agree to do  it and then persuade your questgiver to forget about it, but that initial agreement already grants you some negative points from your companion. Thank you bethesda for that brilliant design.

You also get A LOT of junk.  Junk  that you can't disamble, but you can sell. Problem is, lockpicks (digipicks) are also under junk, or as the game  calls it ""misc"" items. And so are extremly rare items called Astra, which  you can trade in  at a special store for rewards (haven't found that yet). Meanwhile Ressources are what's needed to craft things, and you  can either buy them, or grab them ""off the floor"" just like any  other  junk item. - Why am I so annoyed by this? Because with already 2 actually VALUABLE items sitting in the same category as actual junk, makes me question: What other valuable items are there, and how many  of them did I already sell? And why can't we dismantle some  materialis like in Fallout? 
There's special wire listed as ressource, and there's junk wire listed as misc, why can't i  dismantle junk wire  to specific ressources?

Oh, and I  don't know  what they thought when they worked on  the face animations, because A: they often don't fit with the acutal dialogue  and B: there expressions are often SO FREAKING CREEPY.

That's  it for now.  I could probably think of many more things I  don't like about this game, and very few things I like so far. I'm  just 12hours in, so I'm gonna keep playing for some more, so I get something out of it for  what I paid.

And who knows, maybe I'll find something that's so  great, it  changes  my whole opinion about the game?

First, the positives: the graphics are great and there are a lot of good options you can tweak. One thing I immediately appreciated was being able to adjust the conversation camera. Seeing characters only from the front all the time felt awkward, but thankfully you can change this to make dialogues feel more natural.

There’s a huge number of planets, POIs, quests and things to explore. The shipbuilding system is fantastic, I’ve sunk many, many hours into designing different ships, which is easily one of my favorite parts of the game. The faction questlines are also really well done and very engaging.

Now for the negatives: I’m still not sure if there’s much point in building bases on planets. There’s no proper builder, you can’t align objects well and everything ends up looking crooked. Apart from gathering some resources (which you don’t really need much anyway), building outposts doesn’t feel very rewarding.

Romance options start out interesting but quickly fall flat. There’s no real way to spend time with your partner after finishing their questlines and they tend to be a bit too ""perfect"", make one decision they dislike and your relationship takes a big hit.

One thing that disappointed me was the planetary exploration. Initially, it sounded like there would be a lot of variety, but in practice, many of the buildings are copy-pasted. While playing through the main story you see cool, unique locations... but when you start exploring planets, the scattered buildings look exactly the same, with identical layouts and loot spots (just different loot). It gets repetitive fast and for a game that promised ""procedurally generated POIs,"" it’s a bit of a letdown when they’re just recycled interiors.

Another big negative for me is Bethesda’s new monetization. Charging 1000 credits (10€ or more) for a single questline in the Creations store is just not okay, I refuse to buy them at that price. A few euros might be fine, but this feels like an obvious cash grab.

I haven’t finished the new DLC yet, I only just started it, but I’ll definitely play through it at some point.

All in all, I’d rate the game around 7/10. It’s good for at least one full playthrough. New Game Plus is also not that exciting, you lose everything, and while some parameters can change, it’s not really enough to make repeat playthroughs feel fresh.

In the end, it’s a good game, I’m glad I played it, but there’s a lot of room for improvement.",True,3,19765

Starfield,1716740,197424278,"I’ve got Fallout tattoos on my body and emotional scars from Fallout 76 in my soul. 

So when Starfield was announced — like everyone else — I strapped myself in for a wait that felt longer than an intergalactic load screen on a rusty Xbox One. 

Bethesda’s reputation for delivering genre-defining, bug-riddled masterpieces precedes it, and as someone who has worshipped at the altar of Vault-Tec, I was cautiously optimistic. And by ""cautiously optimistic,"" I mean obsessively refreshing news feeds for five years and whispering, ""Please don’t be 76 in space.""

And you know what? They pulled it off.

Starfield is vast. Like, existential-crisis inducing vast. The space environments? Breathtaking. Sometimes I’d just float in orbit, staring at a digital gas giant like I was trying to feel something again. The ship customisation? Absolutely addictive. I lost hours tinkering with engines and modules when I should have been saving the galaxy or at least stealing sandwiches from NPCs.

The storytelling hits the sweet spot. Bethesda does its best when it leans into mystery and moral ambiguity, and Starfield has both in spades. It’s not perfec, few Bethesda games are, but it delivers where it counts: rich world-building, satisfying exploration, and that weird feeling that even the most mundane side quest somehow matters.

There’s still that familiar Bethesda jank (hello, NPCs who walk through walls like ghosts with unfinished business), but it almost feels comforting at this point. Like, if your companion didn’t get stuck in a doorway mid-monologue, would it even be a Bethesda game?

So yeah, Starfield won me over. It’s not the second coming of Skyrim, but it’s a damn fine space epic. It's flawed. It’s ambitious. It's got soul. And after the slow-motion trainwreck that was Fallout 76, it feels like coming home… to a home that happens to be orbiting a planet with space pirates, alien artifacts, and at least six factions trying to recruit you within your first hour of gameplay.

Starfield,1716740,197418240,"I've had some time to digest this one. I did everything, put it down for a while, then came back to it for second taste. The short answer is, it's just okay. At some points it even qualifies as good. But It's rarely great, and too frequently bad. The amount of missed potential here is staggering.

We'll start with what I liked: It's a new adventure, and in the opening chapter it does a great job at building a sense that you have an enormous galaxy to explore before you and this is a universe that is both highly technologically advanced and still a rugged frontier. Your first quest shows you the scale and grandeur the game engine is capable of. The bespoke, non-procedural generated story locations are unique and life-like. There's even a glimmer of something mysterious and special when you get some cool new space magic

Then the bad: Everything else. At the risk of sounding cliche, the universe here is as vast as the ocean, and as deep as a puddle. The ""1000 planets"" touted so highly might as well be 4; the flat barren one, the jungle one, the snow one, and Australia. The variations are so trivial that each could barely hold my attention long enough to complete whatever fetch quest I came for. A meager handful of flora and fauna to scan and ""catalog"" that bare an incredible similarity to the last planet, and the one before that, etc. And the same could be said of the points of interest. About the third time I wandered through the same cryo-facility with the same corpses, same loot, same enemies, and same notes with the same names, just on a different planet, I realized that I hit the limit on the exploration aspect of the game.

And then I was robbed of the sense of adventure the opening chapter promised. Everywhere I went, somebody had been there. The surface of every planet is littered with abandoned structures and homesteads, or the remains of corporate industrialism. From a narrative perspective it drives me right out of the immersion. The presence of mysterious alien ruins unknown to mankind a short walk from the local space-Waffle House while random ships fly overhead of what should be an uncharted, virgin world destroys any of the mystery of discovering them in the first place. And a sense of mystery is only satisfying if there are breadcrumbs along the way to hint at a purpose to it. They just dump all this mysterious alien-looking nonsense everywhere and then never explain any of it. Then I see why all those buildings everywhere are abandoned: they got bored and left.

Then there's the combat. The game goes into great detail to build a world where a great war has recently concluded, and all the cool death rays, robo-mechs, bio-weapons, and other portable war-crimes that definitely exist in this universe have been conveniently outlawed and locked away by space-NATO. And what do they do with this sprawling arsenal of Chekhov's guns? They only fire the lamest one of them. No boss fights against towering mechs, no illegal weapons to smuggle past authorities on or off worlds to give you an ethically questionable leg-up on the scum of the galaxy. Just goofy looking guns, knives, and some mediocre gunplay with uninspired workbench mods. Only this game can make lasers boring. Blasting an enemy ship to pieces with laser cannons and missiles should be fun. Instead, it's a contest to see who has the more shield points while you spam all your weapons into one of the, at most, 3 enemies in front of you. Even the space magic is boring. They were literally given license to throw the laws of physics out the window and come up with something exciting, and the best they could do was ""Fus Ro Da, but in space"". And the same fly-through-the-rings puzzle every single time. TOTK had 104 unique shrine puzzles, and this game only has one. This review is already long enough, but we have to address the worst thing of all, the companions.

Your companions are perhaps the biggest missed opportunity of them all. They all have the same likes and dislikes, a choice to please one is likely a choice to please them all. To their credit, none of them are psychopaths. They won't gleefully join you in committing acts of terror, and rightfully so. It wouldn't make any sense to play this game as if it were a live GTA server. But there is no nuance. Every one of them is an upstanding member of society with no desire to disrupt anything around them. Even the one that used to be a criminal will bug out on you if you do some actual crime. If they were different flavors of ice cream, they would all be vanilla. I didn't find myself attached to any of them, and their various involvements in any events of the game didn't elicit much of an emotional response from me. [Sarah Morgan disliked that]

The game is mechanically sound and well polished from technical standpoint. But I could go on and on about specific plot points, character interactions (or lack thereof), and world building ideas that just missed the mark and could have been so, so much more. This game is worth about $25, tops. I advise you only buy it if it ever goes on sale, and for no more than that.",False,645,22646
Starfield,1716740,197416919,"Note: I played on the Steam Deck. Works without issue other than some sound crackling after using the power button to pause play a few times. 

Quick Summary: There is a good game in here but unfortunately you can play it wrong (as I did originally). Yes you shouldn’t be able to play a game wrong but play it right and space RPG fun can be had. 

Long Version: Playing the game wrong > You can’t play this game (in my opinion) like No Mans Sky or Skyrim. Scanning stuff gets dull & repetitive (no real variety of life). You can’t wander around & do your own thing; space is too big compared to a region on a planet for a game map. 

*** The internet has new game tips but as my review / tips to get the best from the game ***

Story: Play the main story to at least > Into the Unknown > Minor not a real spoiler, you get a Skyrim type dragon shout. After this enemies start popping up Level 30. You can beat them but it drains resources, so now switch to the faction story lines. 

Travel: Other than the map telling you the difficulty of the star system (it says Level 10, 20, 50 etc. etc.) it should be avoided. Jump from place to place using the mission menu and > Set Location for mission. It’s faster and drops you immediately where you need to be. 
Next Up: Do the ranger missions next, you should scale as needed. If you don’t want trophies, steal the Watchdog ship during a mission. Nobody cares and it’s a strong fighter for early play. (you need to use the console ~ commands)

At the end of the rangers, you get a cool ship and now you are ready to do the main story or wander about. 
However > wonder via specific missions you like the sound of rather than just wander as mentioned above. Basically, any other location on a planet outside of the mission objective is just repetitive filler. Save time, go to the next mission & have more fun/story.  

Now What: Once you have done main story & rangers you should be knocking level 30. Finish the main story or do other side stories. You should be established enough to understand the game by now. 
Companions: You can’t be a lone wolf. Take companions & fill them with resources, some to keep and some to sell. Transfer everything to the ship regularly to free up you and the companion for more looting until the shops replenish their money. 

Base Skills: Honestly the only two base skills that I found worth picking at the character build was lock picking & persuasion. Everything else just works itself out during the game. Those 2 skills give you a better start. 

End Summary: Once your character is established. Playing the missions rather than wondering takes you to some fantastic places & stories. 
Neon is a fabulous cyberpunk space city. It must look fantastic on high end PCs. 
The ship that took generations to arrive at a planet only to find out that humans that left Earth later than them arrived hundreds of years first is thought provoking mission. 
The historical people clone world is bizarre & a good stupid fun break off for coming the beat and track. 

…and those are the ones I’ve found so far.

Starfield,1716740,197307823,"Nearly 100 hours of Starfield between two campaigns, one at launch and another starting 2 weeks ago. 

I think I'm a bit jaded when it comes to this game because, on one hand, it's very evident that the folks at Bethesda really did pour THOUSANDS of hours into creating this game only for it to get scathing reviews, but on the other, they somewhat did it to themselves by advertising it as ""Skyrim in space"" when it definitely is not that. I think Starfield plays the most like FO4 out of any other game, probably with a mixture of No Man's Sky. Is that a bad thing? Well, I'm giving it a positive recommendation because NMS is one of my favorite games of all time and I am a sucker for space games, but not because it is Skyrim in space. 

Starfield is one of those games where it either moves really fast for you, or really slow early on and the inverse generally happens by the time you reach 15 hours. Then around 30 the decision is subconsciously made in your mind about whether you are having fun. My first playthrough, I played for about 40 hours with the first 10 being incredibly dull, but after discovering a few neat POIs, I ended up getting completely pulled into the world. However, after a million loading screens and repeated locations, I just never launched the game again until very recently.

All of this sounds strange and slightly negative, but I think Starfield offers a blend of different game(s) mechanics that cannot be fully replecated anywhere else. I love the fact that while it is a complete sandbox, you are also able to play in a very linear sense. Completing quests over and over without regard to creating an outpost (which you don't have to), scanning an entire planet (which you don't have to) or creating your own ships from scratch (which you don't have to). Some days, I would hop onto my save to work on some of my outposts and ships, while others I would complete two major faction quest lines in a day, and during my interstellar travels, would accidentally get 4 more quests that I could start. This feedback loop is incredibly satisfying and keeps me launching the game. 

People's complaints about the game are largely valid, with Starfield having a lot of loading screens, repetitive POIs and too PG of a setting to truly RP. But with a few potential updates or DLC, expansion on outpost building, and a few mods, this game truly opens up and becomes something that I not only enjoy, but recommend.",True,55,6661
Starfield,1716740,197298937,"I've spent a significant amount of time exploring the vast expanse in Bethesda's latest sci-fi game. While it's clear that the developers have put a lot of effort into creating an immersive experience, I found myself wanting more. Just a note, I haven't messed around with the mods and only stuck to the original game. Overall it's worth playing despite all the negative reviews. I had fun playing it and I bet you will too.

[h1] Pros [/h1]
+ Stunning visuals: The game's visuals are stunning, with detailed character models, environments, and special effects that make for an immersive experience.
+ Lots of side quests.
+ Amazing sound effects and quality, both in game and voice-overs.
+ Great animation quality.
+ Awesome main story: [spoiler] Even NASA is involved. [/spoiler]
+ Immersive Setting: Starfield's universe is rich in lore and history, with a complex web of factions, governments, and alien species that add depth to the game's narrative.
+ Exploration. The game's open-world design allows for seamless travel between planets, each with its unique atmosphere, geology, and ecosystem.
+ Ship building is awesome!: Love completing some quests to get ship blueprints and experimenting with new designs. The models not only have different looks but act as functional parts that you can walk through and experience. (Some of the parts you can walk through).


[h1] Cons [/h1]
- Too many loading screens: It's not like I have a slow computer, In fact, I have pretty much the best you can get when it comes to PC hardware. The game seems to have loading screens for scenes that don't need them.
- Storyline: While engaging in parts, the game's storyline can feel disjointed and lacks the cohesion of previous Bethesda games. The main quest is often overshadowed by repetitive side quests that fail to contribute much to the overall narrative.
- Underdeveloped Features: Some features, such as ship-to-ship combat and diplomacy, feel underdeveloped or unpolished, detracting from the overall experience.

I give this game: 3/5

Sarah, who you get stuck with early on because of a plot point for an early quest line, gets literally stuck on every surface, spasming around.

You can carry very little loot, but everything is lootable.  That's just annoying.  Presumably, that can be enhanced with perks.  But it's such a grind, even early on, to unlock perks.  And for whatever reason, Bethesda didn't think that a local map was necessary.  And in the couple of years since release and, I assume, listening to people bitch about it, they still haven't patched that in.  Huge areas, no fucking clue where I am.  I can deal with a lot, when I'm not lost.  But, this is the tipping point for me.  I won't be bored and lost.  And it all looks the same, so GL with landmarks.

The biggest immersion killer? Loading screens. Everywhere. Walk into a building? Loading screen. Board your ship? Loading screen. Land on a planet? You guessed it. Other games have found creative ways to disguise them—Starfield gives you a static wallpaper. It absolutely breaks the flow of exploration and constantly reminds you you're playing a game stitched together by menus.

Then there's the companions and characters—bland, shallow, unmemorable. They lack depth and personality, and I never felt attached to any of them. The factions? Barely interact. You’d expect dynamic political tension or interesting inter-faction quests—what you get instead is largely siloed storylines that rarely overlap.

The main quest is another huge issue. The design seems almost to encourage players to rush through to New Game Plus (NG+). But if you take that bait, you’ll likely regret it, especially once you realize what happens to the world you leave behind. There’s a real sense of lost potential here, where meaningful progression is replaced by a hollow loop.

The planets and environments are visually decent at first glance but feel fake and lifeless the more you explore. Recycled points of interest, repeated base layouts, generic caves... it becomes a chore. There’s no joy in landing on a new moon just to find the same exact outpost you cleared three planets ago. There are no meaningful landmarks, no places that spark curiosity or make you want to revisit them—nothing like Skyrim’s iconic spots that felt alive and worth exploring.

Bottom line: Starfield lacks soul. It doesn’t immerse you in its universe—it reminds you you’re stuck in a cycle of loading screens, shallow characters, and copy-pasted content. I didn’t feel like I belonged in this universe. I just felt like I was checking boxes.

Starfield,1716740,197067568,"Starfield — 608.8 h played  
Score: 7 / 10

A space-sandbox brimming with top-tier character progression and a brilliant ship builder—yet weighed down by copy-paste planets, too few questlines, and an outpost system that feels half-formed.

ANALYTICAL HIGHLIGHTS  
• **Leveling system (standout)** — Perks gated by challenges keep every skill investment meaningful; respecs, weapon specializations, and difficulty sliders combine for endless buildcraft.  
• **Ship builder excellence** — Snap grids, diverse modules, and flight-model trade-offs make designing haulers, gunboats, or smugglers genuinely creative. It’s the game’s signature toy box.  
• **Quest quality** — Faction arcs and miscellaneous jobs are well-written and cinematic while they last; individual missions rival Bethesda’s best set pieces.  
• **Modding runway** — Early quest packs (Dark Universe, Silent Dominion) and the newly released Creation Kit show a community already filling content gaps.

CRITICAL SHORTCOMINGS  
• **Procedural planets** — Reused tile sets, empty biomes, and repeated POIs turn exploration into déjà vu; easily the weakest procedural generation Bethesda has shipped.  
• **Quest drought** — Quality is high, but quantity is not. The game needs **three times** the quest chains to feel fully developed.  
• **Outpost building** — Interface is smooth, but outputs don’t matter; resources rarely gate progress and no real economy ties into the broader game loop.  
• **Companions & main story** — Core crew feel thin, and the multiverse-flavoured main plot never lands the emotional punch of earlier Bethesda epics.  
• **Performance** — Even on a Core i7-11700K / RTX 3090, New Atlantis can dip under 60 fps; CPU constraints persist.

FINAL ASSESSMENT  
Starfield excels at character builds and custom ships, but its procedural planets, sparse quest count, and underutilised outposts leave it feeling like an Early-Access framework. If you’re willing to lean on mods and trust that future DLC will triple the quest content, there’s a stellar sandbox here. If not, you may want to keep the grav drive in standby until Bethesda and the mod community flesh out the universe.

Main story is shallow, feels like recycled Skyrim. Other interactions are somewhat more interesting that Skyrim or Fallout, but bar was rather low. Persuasion is utter nonsense - you get few random lines from a pool and it's perfectly possible that you will not get the ones you need to succeed.

Factions have okay storylines but once more - beyond few hours of shooting and sneaking you are done and don't really feel like it was worth much.

I will start with what's good in the game because there's so much bad I will need time to write.

1. The ship building is fun and something I always want to engage with, but it's way too hard to do and take so much time because the interface and the mechanic of it is just not intuitive. I want this back in a Starfield 2 potentially.

2. The weapons are the best guns Bethesda ever done, it's by far not perfect, but gunplay is serviceable it's fine.

3. Some quests are great

4. Space is just cool


Now what's bad and I trully hated.

1. The Quests, as I said some quests are great, the rest is just awfull
2. The exploration. There's nothing I hate more than getting to a barren planet, and walking or using the vehicule to reach a rock with nothing at all and that's it and if I take 4 more hours on that planet just walking, driving to various POI what will I see ? Nothing of substance, I won't find some random quest, I will shoot a few guys, get a bit of materials and that's about it.
3. The cities, they are just awfully designed, the main city is the worst of the bunch there's 0 feel of grandeur and it's just poorly agenced, the fact the city is shallow but there's loading screens to get from A to B if you wanna take the trams is awfull. Witcher 3 done great cities years before starfield and that while making it fun to walk around without the need of loading screens.
4. The Ships space combats and overall the space exploration with the ships. This feels insane to me to know they had the possibility to make a space game, and space is just an after thought. Nothing to do in space outside, random encounters and space stations, nothing. The combats are awfull with the micro gestion of shield, weapons, it could be fun the way it's handled with keys or controller is just awfull. There's no enjoyement out of the space fights and most of the time it's, wait for auto-lock, spam, win or lose. 

And this is without even mentionning the choice to add loading screens to enter your ship, to get on a lader to get to the cockpit, then wait for a cinematic to sit on the cockpit, then hold a key to finally take off, then watch the ship take off, then loading screen, then you're tped in space, then you gotta open your map, navigate where you wanna go, then make sure you correctly added power to the astromotors, and then wait for another cinematic, and then another loading screen.

I am not joking when I say I can spent 3 minutes, just to freaking take-off and get where I want to and that with 0 fun, not a single second of engaging gameplay.

THIS is just the worst of the worst in the game. 

Imagine what we could've if they cared about space exploration, done less planets ( which are barren anyway ) and make it so you could get from planet, to space, without loadings and just playing or hiding the loadings like in Star Wars outlaws.

5. Loots, waste of time, nothing is engaging, you'll find most of your stuff on people you kill with pretty much 0 reasons to loot around outside of a few things.

But, you dont have to go to every single planet, 10% of them have life, means over 100 planets there have life, which, IMO is great enough. I dont care what anybody else says.

Starfield,1716740,196848641,"TLDR: Starfield does not reward exploration and you shouldn't play it if you are a completionist or will do anything but play the quests.

I have been a fan of Bethesda RPGs since Morrowind. I have played Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4. I can honestly say I didn't enjoy every minute of every game but then again nothing is perfect. I particularly disliked the system changes between installments. Morrowind and Oblivion generally shared the same skill system. Fallout 3 did a great job of implementing the SPECIAL system from Fallout 1 & 2. Skyrim and Fallout 4 majorly regressed from their previous games. I understand the reason why even if I don't agree with it: simpler games sell to a wider audience which means more profits for the shareholders. The same goes for Starfield.

Here is what I think happened: the developers saw the success of No Man's Sky and decided to make their own version. The problem is that No Man's Sky is a game with an entire galaxy to explore but nothing to find. Let me explain in Starfield terms. You leave the first planet but you can't grav jump so you have to land somewhere in system to get fuel. You land on the planet and there are a few places to explore. Having played previous Bethesda games, you might be impressed at this point: looking at the galaxy map reveals over 100 star systems. Herein lies the problem: the vast majority of those star systems contain planets with nothing to find. Occasionally, you might find a dev designed dungeon but most of the time its cookie cutter dungeons with nameless enemies and random loot. Furthermore, most of the time star systems have 5+ planets with moons. In order to fully explore a star system, you must land on each planet and scan some rocks and creature creator monsters. I'm glad they didn't add a ""fully survey every star system"" achievement. I would still be scanning. Did they really need to created a galaxy with 100+ star systems? Who played this game for 15 minutes and said ""Looks good. Ship it""? The core gameplay loop is this: land on planet, scan rocks, scan monsters, fast travel to ship, fast travel to planet, watch takeoff cutscene, fight pirates in order, land on planet, watch landing cutscene, rinse and repeat. This is not fun! This is work!

Two more small gripes: the outpost system seems worthless (a lame attempt to add the settlement system into the game) and space combat seems a bit under cooked.

Here is why I'm sad: there is a good game to be found in Starfield. I can honestly say I had fun with most of the scripted story missions especially Ryujin and the Crimson Fleet. Here is how I would redesign Starfield: copy elements from Mass Effect 2 and The Outer Worlds. Mass Effect 2 allowed you to scan planets for resources. This would avoid the Starfield problem of landing on hundreds of moons with the same 2 or 3 resources. The Outer Worlds is closer to a traditional Bethesda experience with multiple planets and each planet is a dev designed map with explorable places. With a few less planets and more purposeful dungeon design, Starfield would have been great and probably one of my favorite games. Instead, I am telling those who intend to play: don't stray off the path, there is nothing to find.

From there you chart your own journey across over 1,000 planets, taking on faction missions, building ships and outposts, fighting pirates and shaping your place in a galaxy full of opportunity and danger. It is a game about exploration, freedom and carving out your own legend among the stars.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3495028307

[b]First, let's get real: Starfield isnt perfect.[/b] Loading screens when warping between planets or entering cities will pull you out of the moment. Procedural generation means some planets can feel like vast empty spaces which dampens the sense of discovery. The majestic [spoiler]temples[/spoiler] ended up feeling like a copy-paste job, which came across as a pretty lazy bit on Bethesda's end. And my personal biggest let down: The universe is packed with human colonies, pirate factions and mysterious ruins, but if you were hoping to have deep conversations with alien civilizations or forge alliances with creatures from another star system, you will not find that here. [b]WHYYY BETHESDA?![/b] The alien life you do encounter is mostly wild and hostile, more space critter than cosmic allies. For a game about exploring the vast unknown, for me, this felt like a missed opportunity.

[i]But still, there's something here.[/i]

Starfield is built as a sandbox to lose yourself in. Its sheer scale lets you chart your own path, crafting ships, surveys, setting up outposts or weaving through a gang undercover mission that rivals cinematic heists. One thing that kept Starfield really fun is it's main questline and the faction storylines. If youd ask me, these are the real stars of the show, packed with exciting missions and unexpected twists that make you want to keep pushing deeper into the galaxy. Whether youre sneaking through the shadows with the Crimson Fleet or navigating corporate intrigue with Ryujin Industries, these arcs feel hand-crafted and full of life. The main story itself eventually dives into some wild sci‑fi ideas that make you stop and think, adding a nice sense of wonder and payoff for the journey. Of course, not every part of the galaxy glitters. Some side quests are more like space debris floating between planets and often feeling like basic errands. You will find the occasional gem, but a lot of them blur together and lack the charm of the main arcs.

At its core, Starfield is a galaxy sized canvas that invites you to chart your own path. It may wobble through some asteroid fields with repetitive side content and occasional jank, but when you are deep in a great faction storyline or piloting your custom starship through the stars, it absolutely shines. For anyone who loves crafting a personal space saga and losing themselves in a vast universe, this is one spaceship worth boarding.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3495336155

[b]Recommended![/b] It may not be a flawless supernova, but it glimmers with potential. I'd say: Focus on the hand-crafted parts of the game, the main quest and the faction quests. Forget about the No Man Sky's kinda procedural generated crap. You'll most likely feel disappointed walking on the vast empty planets and seeing repeated copy paste 'dungeons' and 'caves'.

I do mental gymnastics and carefully planned runs to make games like Skyrim and Fallout 4 actually make sense and be immersive. It's not easy but it's possible. Not here. I bought the overpriced deluxe edition to play this game early. I played thorough everything the game has to offer and the DLC to boot. I am fucking desperate for more of these types of games, but even with the benefit of being able to look back at it and just remember the good parts, it just wasn't very good.

If you give this game a honest chance and try to immerse yourself, you will only find yourself punished.

The most generous thing I can say about it is that it had some good ideas, but it's like it was handled by a studio that doesn't really have experience making games and they fumbled the implementation big time.

The game is not enjoyable for its story, its quests, its locations, its exploration or its factions. The gameplay is half decent and that is it. If you want a game purely for the gameplay there are far better options. If you want an open world Bethesda-like with the same gameplay, play Fallout 4.

- Gameplay is smooth on High Settings, and I have a 5-year-old PC
- The world is beautifully-crafted, though some consider it a little empty
- In true Bethesda fashion, the NPCs are a little janky, but they have a lot of personality
- Ship mechanics aren't over-the-top, nor are they too simple to be boring. There is some strategy!
- Character Backgrounds are unique, but I don't think they make a huge difference
- Typical Bethesda formula of clearing out bandi- wait, this isn't Skyrim.
- The quests outside of the main one are worthwhile. I haven't explored all of the factions yet, but I am seriously enjoying the UC Vanguard questline

Starfield,1716740,196416022,"I wanna start off by saying that yes,
I know that this, in many people's eyes is a mediocre one, a disappointment, even a bad game for others.  

""Oh but don't you see? Most of the game is barren, these solar systems and assortment of planets that you landed on are... there are barely any things to discover or be amazed by, why would anyone like this?""

Going back to this game almost an ENTIRE YEAR after I abandoned it, in new game plus, only beating the main story and doing nothing else... has taught me at least, that there is more to this game than meets the eye...much much more. You are the one that creates your experience,not other people on the internet. 

There are 3 distinctive strengths that this game has : 

1.Atmosphere 

One moment you explore a random planet, on a quest or not, and you find some weird animals looking at you and some shady looking plants while being awe struck at the various biomes and landscapes and then, after 200 meters or so, you find an abandoned mine, or a 
pirate weapons lab, or a spaceship crash site or another 6-8 different types of settlements that you can engage in either combat, exploration or even trade with.  Some of these places have random letters and computers scattered in them where, besides being able to learn more about the place, it also gives you access to a completely different mission on a different planet or even an event happening on a much more far away solar system. 
At least 5 or 6 big cities to explore that offer amazing depth of structures and a variety of activities,missions,shops and secrets to discover.  I am talking about some areas with a main part of the city and then an underbelly and then yet another another underbelly of that too.  
You find yourself starting the game with 120 solar systems, where, in my experience, I have found at least half of them to be interesting and worth my while, not to mention a good 25 or so planets where you will constantly be tempted to go back due to various plot lines, updates and variety of factions within the game.

2.Factions 

SEVEN different factions. Some good, some neutral or suspicious looking but others outright evil or crazy.  In depth story-lines and at least a range of 7-15 missions for each of them, with unique armor, weapons. 
Ships and hideouts or headquarters, locations that you can visit with them
Please tell me what other game (besides an MMO maybe) has this many groups that are all fleshed out.

I played for every single one of them, I did all of the achievements for this game and even with groups where I did not have any achievement or immediate attachment for, I still got curious enough to see where will a random discussion heard on the various cities streets take me.  Man that was a good choice. 
Yeah we've all seen and heard about the boring ""go here, get that, get back to me, done"" type of missions and the ""go to this obviously bad looking place kill anyone you see, bring back item from the bottom of the place, don't die"" looking quests, and while Starfield does have these as well, I have seen that choice of an outcome or two and often a different approach as well, IS given and encouraged too in the mission briefing. 

There are things in the game that you are always shown about, either by the person that gives you the assignment or by your own imagination and skill.  Alternative ways to get into into a compound or a lab via the vents.
Skills like Persuasion, Bribery, Intimidation even Manipulation that can change the outcome of a conversation with the target of your mission.  Ways to jump start and surprise people with evidence found on an optional side objective that can turn the outcome of a mission instantly instead of needing to go along with it for another 15-20 minutes.Did i mention hacking turrets and robots via a computer so that in a hostile environment things suddenly get a lot more easier ?

Final rewards of a quest-line that have some of the most useful things a game has ever given me: 
Unique armor and weapons that both look cool and destroy the opposition.
Starships given to you so big that you have no idea where the cockpit is even or ones that are zippy and have some serious firepower added to them with a technician that only works for your personal pleasure and has exclusive upgrade parts that cannot be found anywhere else in the universe. 
Access to some of the best in class companions and VIP level discounts for shops and restaurants in your area. 
Houses located in some of the most exclusive,breathtaking or exotic areas of the city.  

3.Music and Sounds

The raw sound of the engines and turbines (not to forget about the smoke and the fire) of the ships that land and get airborne again at a space-station or on a planet where you are as well, almost as if you are near a NASA ship going into space. I have never head something like this prior to playing this, those ships made me feel as if I was a real person in that game. Next to a giant spaceship. 
Did I even tell you that you can customize these things up to a crazy level or buy a lot of variants? 

The creepy, mysterious or outright haunting music that you hear when being in a cave is a good fit for a game like this where, most of the time, you explore a place all alone.  
This feeling of ""oh,this place feels wrong"" or ""I should not be here at all, I heard something slithering"" could not have been expressed right without audio that doesn't make you anxious.
You thought that there are only rogue pirates in the universe and not also disgusting creatures lurking around as well in this game ? 

The exploration music
It really makes you realize just how lively and beautiful a planet with vegetation,fauna and a temperate climate is versus a barren planet that has been destroyed by radiation, has low oxygen and is risky to go on or even a completely isolated planet like an Ice or Inferno landscape, with nothing but constant snow or sand storms. 

The music that would play in each of the big cities. Various themes that do a very good job at describing the place for you, sound-wise, on your first and subsequent visits and make you realize, almost immediately what kind of people live on this part of the universe. 

The main theme of the game ""Into the Starfield"" is one of the most insane piece of music that I have ever heard in a game theme.
Not many games make me tear up and get emotional after the first few seconds of the game launching and also fewer make me stay on the home screen and listen to the theme to the end. 
Atmosphere and class. 

In the end I just wanted to say again that, yes, this is not a game for anyone and it has it's flaws as well. 
I am not gonna mention all of them here, but they can be found across the internet very easily. 
What I am going to do instead is this:  

Starfield in my opinion - 
Is not a game for you if you do not have the imagination to see the bigger picture that many at Bethesda wanted to replicate when making a huge space themed open world game.

It is not a game for you if you do not go beyond the casual gamer attitude and don't have the patience or attention to read many of the tips,chat logs, books and stories that await and present themselves to you in it's world.  

Is not a game for you if you are someone that has played Bethesda games in the past but you simply do not know how a Bethesda game should be played after all this time. You have to take it slow, and don't rush things as if you are on a speed-run.  This is a fine book that demands a little attention in order to be understood, it doesn't ask much more than what a high school student needs to read.

Didn’t even bother with Lying Bethesda's Other Great Failure, Redfall (total disaster, everybody knows it), and I thought No Man’s Sky was one of the WORST games ever made — terrible, boring, EMPTY. And Starfield? Somehow even WORSE!

Let’s start with the BIGGEST scam — it’s running on the same ancient Engine used by FALLOUT 3, OBLIVION, even MORROWIND — a game from 2002, folks! Over 20 YEARS ago! And now they’re calling it “Creation Engine 2” like it’s brand new — just a rebranded, recycled MESS. That’s not innovation — that’s FRAUD with better lighting!

The gameplay? A DISGRACE. Totally lifeless. DEAD. You go from one Loading Screen to the next like it’s some kind of space-themed elevator simulator. The Planets — EMPTY. The bases — copy-paste TRASH. No real exploration, no real Freedom, just a bunch of FAST TRAVEL buttons disguised as a game. VERY SAD!

The characters? WORSE than the game. Every single one sounds like they’re reading from a TELEPROMPTER at a failed HR seminar. You try to pick up a CUP — a CUP! — and your companion starts whining like you committed War Crimes. Who wrote this stuff???

And here’s something NOBODY talks about — the Vending Machines are BROKEN. You land on a high-tech futuristic Moon Base in the year 2330, and the soda machine says “OUT OF ORDER.” Seriously?? We can travel across the galaxy but can’t get a bag of chips? Ridiculous. Total laziness. NO EXCUSE!

Where are the Aliens? WHERE ARE THEY? This is supposed to be a galaxy-spanning adventure — and it’s just HUMANS in different-colored jumpsuits! No Alien Races, languages, or mystery — just corporate sci-fi made by people who’ve clearly never watched the Fake News Media or a decent Movie. Absolutely ZERO imagination!

I quit after 4.5 hours because I realized I’d spent more time in MENUS than actually playing. It’s like a spreadsheet with spaceships. No Heart, no Soul, just a GIANT EMPTY PRODUCT made for Game Pass filler. That’s what you get when the LIARS at Bethesda receive UNDESERVED PRAISE FOR THE MEDIOCRITY THAT WAS SKYRIM!

Starfield is a monumental FAILURE — an overhyped, undercooked, committee-designed waste of time.

Right away, Starfield impresses with how huge it is. You can travel to different star systems and explore all kinds of planets – some empty, some full of cities. It really feels like exploring space, and I often got sidetracked for hours checking out new things.

What you do in the game is super fun. The space battles are awesome, and I especially love that you can raid other ships! There's also building up your own ship, exploring old alien places, and dealing with different groups of people. Shooting bad guys feels good, and there are lots of ways to fight. Plus, like other Bethesda games, there are lots of skills to learn and interesting side missions.

The main story is really good – full of mystery and makes you think. The characters you meet are cool, and the game world feels very detailed and real. The game also looks amazing. Planets, ships, and space views are beautiful, and the music is great too, making everything feel epic.

It's not perfect, which is why it's a 9 out of 10. Some of the computer-made planets can feel a bit empty, and I saw a few small glitches. I also wish I could actually join some of the different factions in a deeper way, or that the main story felt a bit less linear at times. But these are tiny issues in a great game.

Overall, Starfield is fantastic. You can play for hundreds of hours exploring and having adventures. It's a game you'll keep thinking about.

Over the years, Starfield has received a ton of updates and quality-of-life improvements that turned it into something genuinely enjoyable – and I can see myself spending many more hours in it.

I honestly don’t understand the overwhelming negative reviews. I think a lot of people went in with completely wrong expectations. I, on the other hand, went in with none at all – and ended up having an amazing time.

You need to understand the game's strengths and weaknesses and focus on what it does well. It’s obvious that procedurally generated planets don’t offer the same joy as handcrafted exploration – I didn’t even need to try them to know that. But once you stick to the hand-crafted content, the classic Bethesda magic kicks in.

Starfield is something entirely different from Fallout or The Elder Scrolls – and that’s what makes it so fantastic.

This game is seriously overhated and deserves more appreciation. If you’ve been holding off because of the bad reviews, take this as your sign to give it a try. You probably won’t regret it.

I really hope Bethesda continues to support and expand the game with updates and fresh content for a long time.

-Engaging and enjoyable story
-Great graphics
-Gunplay feels smooth and satisfying

Starfield,1716740,196287524,"Summary
Starfield is a good game and a major improvement over Bethesda’s previous work. Animations are better, characters are more varied, and the design is beautiful. The graphics are stunning—still carrying that familiar Creation Engine feel.

However, the writing is severely lacking, which weakens what would normally be seen as Bethesda’s signature charm. If you can get the game on discount (say, for around $20) and don’t expect it to feel like Skyrim, it still has a lot to offer.

Positives
Amazing music: Classic Bethesda atmosphere. They absolutely nailed the tone once again.
Beautiful graphics: Not fully optimized, but visually impressive and immersive.
Content-rich: There’s a wide variety of activities to explore and invest in.
Passion is evident: This doesn’t feel like a lazy product. While not a flawless hit, it feels like a necessary stepping stone. With Creation Engine 2 in place, The Elder Scrolls VI has the potential to be great again.
That Bethesda feeling: The world and ambience feel familiar and welcoming, despite the flaws.

Negatives
1. ""Tell, Don’t Show"" Writing
The crew of Constellation has friendly banter, nicknames, and jokes, trying to feel authentic. But right after that, they go into long, explanatory monologues about how much they appreciate each other more akin to tell versus show.
It completely kills the natural flow and undermines emotional beats. What should be earned feels forced, which hurts the narrative's impact.
2. Unrealistic Reactions
Characters often respond bizarrely to major events.
Example: You discover a mysterious alien artifact—zero idea what it is or what it does—yet no one treats it with realistic caution like lets say a temporary quarantine. your building something that could be dangerous and yet nobody treats it with due carefulness in the name of ""exploration"" and guess what? it ends up being really dangerous. It's as if everybody is insanely naive.
Or: After nearly causing the destruction of New Atlantis, you can casually stroll around like nothing happened.
The lack of meaningful reaction breaks immersion. Characters often don’t feel like real people.

3. Shallow Worldbuilding
Bethesda usually relies on themes and clichés to establish mood and identity in its cities.
In Starfield, the cities feel like set pieces without substance. There’s not much under the surface to engage with—more style than depth. And i'm not talking about the amount of quests. its a shallow ocean versus a deep pond.

4. Clunky Systems
The ship builder sounds great in theory, but in practice it's awkward and confusing.
The base building system suffers from similar issues—good ideas, poor execution.

Neutral
Loading screens: Personally not a big issue. If you avoid the map and use the scanner, transitions feel much faster and less intrusive.

Final Thoughts
That’s it. Starfield isn’t perfect, but it’s not without value. It’s not the next Skyrim, but if you go in with tempered expectations, there’s still a lot to enjoy. Let’s hope this is the warm-up act to something amazing.",True,0,2160
Starfield,1716740,196286642,"This is, unfortunately, one of the most painfully boring games I have ever played in my life. I bought the game on release day and all of Bethesda's updates since then have done little to improve the joy factor that it is sorely lacking. Exploration is dull and unrewarding, combat is woefully repetitive, most of the characters seem absolutely soulless and artificial, character customization is underwhelming, and the game is probably one of the worst offenders of 'quantity over quality' by including such a vast and desolate universe to waste your time roaming.

On the positive side, I do enjoy the shipbuilding aspect of the game. Even though the options available seem limited, players have shown great ingenuity in creating unique and iconic ships. Inon Zur's score for this game is absolutely stellar (no pun intended), which makes it all the more painful that it was wasted on a game such as this.

I can appreciate the main/faction questlines as well as the lore and major locations but having 1,000 planets, 120 stars, and only 82 of the locations handcrafted leads me to believe this game would have greatly benefited if it had been more streamlined. As I am writing this, I have invested 200 hours and only a fourth of that time actually went towards missions while the rest went towards charting planets and cataloging resources as I naturally came across them.",False,2,13370
Starfield,1716740,196281753,"really tried to like it but just more bethesda garbage.

""open world"" is only true if you consider a piece of bread to be a sandwich - there's lots of planets to explore but looking at empty planets is only interesting for so long and at the end of the day you're still just eating a piece of bread. 

If the game's combat, story and gameplay had anything close to the level of polish or effort that the graphics and visual style does, this would be a solid game. If you don't value realism as much as free exploration and an open world, go play no man's sky. If you want realistic graphics and more freedom, go play elite dangerous or star citizen if you fw that. 

Story - 1/10
Very bland character designs and repetitive fetch quests that take you through a nothing story full of nothing characters who talk like early 2000's stereotypical sitcom characters. 

Visuals - 8/10
Aside from the graphical bugs and texturing laziness in places, this game's graphics are gorgeous - The graphics are addicting and for the most part, do look as good as all the trailers. 

Gameplay - 3/10
Ship fighting and exploring planets can be fun but the unending cutscenes really make the game drag. want to land your ship? cutscene. want to dock? cutscene. want to take off? cutscene. want to travel anywhere? cutscene. after games like elite dangerous, star citizen, no mans sky there's really no excuse for these kinds of long repetitive loading screens. 

Value for Money - 3/10
Not worth it unless you want to contribute to todd howards severance package. Certainly not a $120 game

I cannot. Starfield, despite numerous bug fixes, is riddled with network errors, crashes and numerous quality of life issues that have yet to be alleviated. The RPG aspects of the game have significantly diminished over the years as a no to an NPC has now become a ""Later I'll say yes."" How the weight management system has become increasingly annoying and dulling to the game. How the world is lifeless and unapologetically lazy from an equally unapologetically lazy studio. How the combat has seemingly regressed since Fallout 4. How the opportunity for choices has been stripped down to ""yes"" and ""I'll talk to you later."" It's a game that desperately wants you to be a hero, while providing no conundrums for the player beyond ""good guys good, other good guys good, bad guys really bad.""

I want to say the plots of Starfield's major narratives are what will keep you going. They're not. I want to say the companions are useful and will keep you engaged in meaningful and interesting dialogue. They don't. I want to say the gunplay feels smooth and strong. It doesn't. I want to say this game won't crash at least a few times a day; I can't. Starfield is less of a game and more of a cash grab. It's entirely carried by a modding community that puts more care in the game than the developers did.

All of this, however, is in the forefront of what is really a phenomenal ship design minigame, although, even this solid design system is offset by two major problems of space combat in general. The problems with ships, however, are 1) the inconsistencies in ladder and door placements coupled with 2) the lack of viability in weaponry outside of particle beam weapons.

Is Starfield a perfect game? Absolutely not. But with that said, this game gets much more hate than it truly deserves. The main story is actually good with decent replay potential, the different faction side quests are good, and the ship building mechanic is fantastic. The ability to fine tune the game's difficulty to fit your personal style or mood is a refreshing aspect that can actually drive you to personally challenge yourself to gradually get better at the game on your terms or to make higher level gear feel more or less balanced as you progress. As with any game, some NPCs are really well done while others are annoying or forgettable, but that is always a matter of personal taste. Being a long-term Bethesda fan, I do wish there were more romance options, but again, that is a matter of my personal taste. The only complaints I really agree with are those that revolve around outpost building. You can play the game 100 times and never need to use this feature. There are no quests that focus on it (at least that I have encountered), and outside of wanting an immersive experience, the rewards for doing anything with it are not worth the time you invest in it. The Creations modding community has also done an amazing job at expanding the content beyond what the developers included.

Starfield,1716740,196102526,"Starfield Review – A Vast, Beautiful Universe That Runs Flawlessly on the XFX SWFT RX 9070 OC Edition

Starfield delivers exactly what space exploration fans have been waiting for — an ambitious, expansive universe teeming with mystery, adventure, and jaw-dropping vistas. I’ve been playing it on the XFX SWFT RX 9070 OC Edition GPU, and I’m thrilled to report that the game runs incredibly well. Load times are quick, performance is smooth even in the most visually intense areas, and the card handles the game’s demanding environments effortlessly, maintaining high frame rates with ultra settings enabled.

What truly sets Starfield apart is the sheer scale of its universe. This is not just a big game — it's massive. Each star system feels hand-crafted, and the sense of discovery when landing on a new planet never gets old. From frozen wastelands to lush alien jungles, the variety in environments is stunning, and the game constantly surprises you with how different and alive each world feels. The inhabitants of these worlds — both human and alien — have unique cultures, designs, and behaviors that make every encounter feel meaningful.

At first, the story might seem straightforward, but it expands dramatically as you explore and dig deeper. What begins as a space-faring adventure quickly unfolds into a rich, branching narrative full of political intrigue, personal stakes, and philosophical questions about humanity’s place in the universe. The deeper you go, the more rewarding it becomes.

In short, Starfield is a technical and artistic triumph — especially when paired with powerful hardware like the XFX SWFT RX 9070 OC Edition. If you’re looking for a game that offers not just hours, but worlds worth of content, this one’s an easy recommendation.",True,3,8171
Starfield,1716740,196102290,"I like but do not love Starfield. It is a game of things I love, things I dislike, and things I like. There is a symmetry between these three things.

The World:
-I love the handmade major settlements and major areas; they have such cool environments and things to do, they are truly some of the coolest locations Bethesda has ever made. If the game focused on just our Solar System and minimized the random generation, this could have been amazing.
-I dislike the generated overworld, as it get repetitive and there is too little to do in many places, and the native species are too similar.
-I like the overworld combat, the generated caves/space stations, and some bits of random generated settlements. There should be more to what kind of cover and interactions with overworld areas in combat should be used, and the random generated settlements should have variety. Yet, as they are, they are hard to get bored of unless you stick to the random generated areas a lot.

Space Combat:
-I love the space combat. Every weapon feels fun to use, moving feels fun, and it is such a unique gameplay system loop. I love how you can adjust the energy you put into anything in the ship.
-I hate how sometimes you can spawn in space and run into like 5 enemies and completely die. This happens too often.
-I like how you can navigate in combat with the environment. Asteroids, space stations and debris can impact combat. However, it does not have enough effect.

The Graphics:
-I love the general art direction. The way the environment and actors blend together can visually be really good. The sense of scale in this game given graphically is very impressive/
-I hate the level of detail. Things look kind of ugly, especially for what it takes to run this game. Some items and environments look so low resolution, and that is disappointing. It is not as big as a jump over Fallout 4 or 76 as one would hope. The graphical fidelity is very much worse than average for a usual big budget game.
-I like the character models. They can be really good or kind of bad, but most models are average to good-ish.

Everything Else:
-I love love love the gameplay. I covered the space combat, but the on ground combat is super fun. There are so many cool things to do. While I admit it is not particularly deep, it is so much fun.
-The Bethesda-y positives like looting and interactions remain as they are but better. This is a big plus.
-The Bethesda classic bugs are here. This is mostly a negative with some positives. It leans more negative than positive, but not in an overwhelming way.
-The Bethesda jank is here, and that is a slight positive for me, and likely a net neutral for most.
-The transition from space to land is awkward. While I dislike for instance in No Man's Sky that the transition takes too long, here it feels worse not having it at all. The game feels so detached, disconnected and not like a full game as a result. If that detachment was similar to the detachment from procedural generated areas and the handcrafted areas, it would feel more natural.
-The space area is so limited, and there is no real space travel. I want to mega boost into areas between planets and find settlements and randomly generated areas, but I cannot. Everything is tied to little sandboxes in a specific side of a planet. You cannot descend to the planet or leave the area of space just right above the planet. It is so terribly jarring.
-This game runs like crap. This game is terribly optimized. For a game with such low attention to detail and graphical fidelity, it should run much better on every system and PC.
-The items and usual item interactions are funny, the same as any Bethesda game.
-The party, main story missions, and all of that is very cool. I love all my party members.
-The base building is okay, but the starship building is AMAZING! I love it so much! It is so fun to build starships!

This game overall feels incomplete. The engine clearly held it all back, and the concepts as a result were not fully realized. I hope years in the future Bethesda can leverage new technology and development techniques to fix these mistakes, because underneath it, there is a great game.

Starfield,1716740,196083831,"The state of Bethesda is really sad. What happened? I actually enjoyed playing the game, but it feels VERY incomplete. Bethesda has seemingly lost all their creativity and ambition. they are lagging FAR behind other studios in terms of quality, production time, and game maintenance. I hope Bethesda revisits starfield as it has a lot of potential. the shipbuilding and base building systems are basically unplayable and the various cities feel dead despite being full of people. combat is pretty fun but melee is identical to past Bethesda games unfortunately. It is centered around grinding levels which really dampens immersion. I saved the worst for last: (Spoiler warning), there is no starborn version of the main quest, only the option to skip it entirely or replay the main story while pretending to not be starborn. even the main story is incomplete! after telling everyone you are starborn, there should be an entirely different version the main quest line instead of just skipping everything. 

i was willing to overlook the deficiencies early on, but after nearly two years, all we have is an awful DLC and no fixes to the systems that make this game such a disappointing pain to play. i hope Bethesda climbs out of this rut they are in before ES6, though it is doubtful. I can not suggest purchase unless it is significantly discounted or overhauled. I say again, what happened Bethesda?",False,5,35213

Now my computer does the BSOD while installing the game - happens consistently in the same spot / % during install, which is totally weird. It is the only thing that crashes my computer and I can reproduce the issue. I've done chkdsk and sfc and the usual diags.  

So I can't play this game, and oddly, even though I think I would get bored again, I'm kind of pissed.  

So I still don't recommend this game, based off the crashy bullshit in my situation, but also because I got bored with it the first attempt at a playthrough.

I got it working through XBOX Game Pass. I'd rather have it working through Steam. I have no idea why the Steam version stuns my computer during install and the Xbox Game Pass install does not.

Starfield,1716740,196056794,"After having played the game for almost 120 hours, and having just completed my first playthrough, I can say that this game is worth picking up with some considerations. Bare in mind that much of this is based on my personal taste and opinion.

[h1] The Good [/h1]

[h3] Class Roleplay/Variation [/h3]

I found a lot of satisfaction in building my character. It's a slow process that is more rewarding, the more you focus on specific traits. It's not as cookie cutter as prior BGS titles, and requires that you express experience with the skill you're leveling to level it. To increase carry weight further than a tier 1, for instance, the player needs to run a certain distance while above 75% carrying capacity. This is represented in every skill that can be leveled and gives some context to the player becoming more proficient within them. To be a master lock-pick ,you need to pick locks routinely. To become a demolition expert, you need to use explosives routinely. You must adhere to the role you intend to fill as you play in order to be any good at it, since the leveling process is slow and focused.

[h3] Sidequests [/h3] 

BGS games aren't known for having stellar story-telling in side quests. There are some gems that we all remember, like the Thieves Guild quest-line in Skyrim, or ""Here there be monsters"" in Fallout 4. But over-all, they are relatively uninspired from a plot stand-point. Starfield raised the bar massively in this regard. Rarely have I been immersed in a side-quest like I did [spoiler] being a double operative between Sysdef and the Crimson Fleet [/spoiler], or being a [spoiler] secret agent for Ryujin Industries [/spoiler].

[h3] Gunplay [/h3]

Some folks may disagree with me here, but I had a load of fun getting into scuffles with major antagonistic factions in Starfield. Every large gunfight felt smooth and exciting, especially for a BGS game. BGS took everything they learned with Fallout 4's vastly improved animations and gunplay, and dialed it up to 10 with Starfield. Sure, there's some jank here and there, being a creation engine game with all the limitations we're familiar with. But I was not left unimpressed with Starfield. Firing a lever action grenade (rocket?) launcher into a crowd of Spacers is exactly as fun as you'd want it to be, and mowing down crimson fleet with a microgun (minigun) is serotonin incarnate. If nothing else, I'd pay $40 for a game that takes just the combat in Starfield and throws it at you in a linear campaign. It's a good time, when it does come into play.

[h3] Difficulty Settings [/h3]

Normally, this isn't something I'd include in any review, and I'll keep it relatively short, but Starfield went above and beyond when it comes to customizing the difficulty in your playthrough. There is a feature-length list of settings to fine-tune every action you can complete in the game to be just as difficult as you'd like it to be. Enemy health and damage modifiers, item weights, you name it; starfield lets you customize it to a very detailed degree and rewards you for making it more difficult. If anyone has played the later entries in the Forza franchise, and is familiar with the difficulty settings and rewards for cranking anything up, then they'll be well aware of how starfield's settings work.

[h3] Ship Customization [/h3]

Starfield's ship customization is beyond in-depth. and it would be impossible for me to lay everything out here, but I'll give some examples of what you can do:

You can get up from your cockpit and fully explore the interior of the ship you, yourself, put together using hab modules.

You can equip different habitation modules that allow you to customize what you can do when exploring your ship, IE engineering hab for weapon and suit upgrading, med hab for pharmaceutical crafting, armory for storing and displaying your weapons of war, mess halls, computing habs, you flipping name it.

As you level your skills, you'll be able to equip better modules that allow you to build bigger ships (with more habs), defeat tougher pirates, go faster, carry more (or illegal) cargo, and last longer.

You can make your ship look DOPE AS F***, with different ship manufacturers providing different appearances that you can stay consistent with, or even mix-match. You can make a Deimos combat vessel with a militaristic appearance, or you can build a Stroud Eklund ship that looks sleek and clean. You can build a Hope Tech ship that looks like a massive cargo hauler. You can do ANYTHING. It's awesome.

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

[h3] Ship Combat [/h3]

I personally find the ship combat being dull, having myself played a ton of Elite: Dangerous. Ships do very basic maneuvers, with the difficulty only really coming into play with the level of the combatant ships and their components. For me, personally, it's like fighting my spreadsheet against theirs, with little variance in HOW the ships maneuver or otherwise interact. Some will find it very engaging, and I have had some fun with it here and there, but over-all it feels meh for me.

[h3] Travel [/h3]

Oh boy... Here comes the source for all of the Starfield memes, and none of them are entirely out of place. topic is going to be two-fold, including locale travel, and interstellar travel. 

[b] On foot, [/b] Traveling between POI is mostly void of interaction or interesting centerpieces and world-building. Once at a POI, it can get quite deep and engaging (when that POI hasn't duplicated for you a dozen times yet with Starfield's randomization). But In between those points of interest are mostly either just passing eye candy or barren wasteland based on what kind of planet you are on. 

[b] In space, [/b] how you travel with your ship is... vacuous. During combat, your ship movement has some significance, but when traveling between star systems, it's simply choosing a location on the star-map, and waiting for your grav drive to spool up. While I'm not as concerned about loading screens as many folks are, it can get tiresome seeing it EVERY TIME you travel somewhere else. I understand that this is a limitation of the engine, but could we not, perhaps, decrease the amount of star systems we would need to travel to, or otherwise make jumping around more interesting?

[h3] Weapon Variety [/h3]

While there are a ton of different weapons in Starfield that might contradict what the title suggests, I find the lack of ""unique"" natured weapons in a BGS game quite saddening. There's no Starfield equivalent of ""Mehrunes' Razor"" or ""Dawnbreaker"" from Skyrim within Starfield. Starfield tries to fill the gaps left by not having these mythic unique weapons with variants of weapons you normally find everywhere, but with bunch of neat effects. Sure, the effects are cool and make the gun stand out to some degree, but it's still visually the same thing as the sidestar I have been using since level 10. I'd like to have a unique minigun that looks visually different while also having those effects. Give me more reasons to explore in Starfield.

[h1] In Conclusion... [/h1]

I think Starfield is well worth its price tag for a somewhat broad audience. The reviews, however, are mixed for a good reason. There are as many areas that Starfield was left with minimal effort or foresight, as there are areas with extensive effort and foresight. Sometimes, the two intersect, and what would otherwise be a phenomenal feature turns into one worth less player investment because of the limitations regarding what you can do with that feature (ship design).

It is, however, worth a shot. The quests in Starfield are stellar and well-developed in most cases, and there's plenty to sink your teeth into. Just be prepared for a frustration every now and then. 

I'd rate Starfield a 7/10, personally.",True,91,6973
Starfield,1716740,196046811,"Feels like Fallout 4 re-skinned in space. Every generated structure is identical on each planet, which makes exploring new planets really boring. 
This game has so much potential, 6/10. Here's hoping Bethesda releases Starfield 2.0.",False,2,8102
Starfield,1716740,196040454,"Long ago, I bought a new GPU, I thought that GPU had a good spec for its price, that's why I bought it. But I then realized it came with Steam code for Starfield, this was before Starfield launched by the way, not just that but the code came with Shattered Space expansion too. So thankfully I didn't paid for this game, though I haven't finished it cause it's boring, but I would probably come back eventually. But it's crazy, 70 dollars for a game, 30 dollars for the expansion, so 100 dollars in total, and I got them both for free.

Did you know Skyrim has a mod that enables multiplayer? Well, that same mod creator was trying to add that mod for Starfield, only for that creator not to do it cause the game was too boring. Your companion in Starfield was so annoying that someone even made a mod in Starfield that made your companion not talk anymore. You also cannot loot dead creatures like you could in Skyrim and Fallout, thankfully there is also a mod that enables that, but since the game was invented without that in mind, the armor I feel was too good and too heavy for new players.

There is also a mod that give you more skill-tree though, so that's cool. Starfield might technically be one of the better Star Wars game too cause there's also a mod, pretty much a remake of Starfield, story included, but Star Wars version. But it's not good when people have to make mods to make the game good, mods shouldn't be a way to make bad games good, mods should be a way to make an already good game even better. Funny that only way to turn this into a actual good game is not just through any mods, it's through a mod the literally remake the entire game.

Oh, and the LOADING. Here is a example of how bad the loading is. Get in your ship, loading. Leaves planet, loading. Teleport to another planet, loading. Only for you to spawn next to the planet, so another loading to land on the planet. Leaves your ship, loading. Since you land next to the city rather than inside (for some, not all), another loading to get inside the city. Then going to next area inside the same city, loading again. All that just to get to a single place, now do that again cause it was only a fetch quest. Now imagine that, but for someone like me who has a potato PC, it took me few minutes just to load once, it might as well as take me like 30 minutes worth of loading just to get to a single city, so if it's a fetch quest then I would probably spend more time spent on a loading screen rather than actually doing the quest just to give you the idea how bad. I'm using a SDD by the way, not HDD, though you may still load faster since my PC aren't the strongest, just saying I have that issue even with a SDD. And another thing, even if you have a ship, even if there is a ship battle, to me it doesn't feel like the game has a ship at all. You know why? Cause you don't need to unlock fast travel, fast travel are already unlocked for you, and the reason why is because YOUR SHIP MOVES SO SLOW THAT FAST TRAVEL IS THE ONLY WAY TO TRAVEL!! A game advertised for having controllable and customizable ships I can use in space, that I barely use it thanks to fast travel and the slow speed of my ship, only time I actually did used my ship more is for ship related missions, which even than I still needed to teleport to the mission that's just next to a different planet to even get to.

Oh, and get this. They literally said they made the planet look deserted cause in real life ""Astronaut weren't bored when they got to the moon"", yet here we are even more bored because of it.

I'm not sure if they fixed some of this issues during the expansion update, so you don't have to take my every word at face value since last I played the game was before the expansion released and I haven't even beaten the base game, but I doubt it fixed alot of stuff I mentioned when looking at all the other reviews I'm seeing.

Is it possible to have fun in this game? Maybe depending on if you can ignore those issues, higher chance of having fun when using a mod, but by default most people wouldn't I imagine, you can tell by the amount of bad reviews this game got. 50 hours playtime I have it said? I spent more time waiting patiently on a loading screen than actually playing, though since my PC aren't good your loading issue might not be as bad as mine. If you want immersion at similar level to Skyrim and Fallout then you won't get that here, but if all you want is just having a choice in a RPG and can get pass all those issues then you ""probably"" can have fun. I thought it was funny that Star Wars mod for Starfield is more fun than actually playing Star Wars games though, so hey, if you're a Star Wars fan then there's that, lol XD. Star Wars mod is called Star Wars Genesis, it's like alot of different Star Wars related mod packaged all in one aka Modpack which even changed the story of Starfield as well as UI, crafting system, dialog, planets, vehicles, armors, NPC, sound, 10,000+ new voicelines, and even use Blasters/LightSabers/Force as a weapon, probably the biggest mod in Starfield right now, this modpack even ""improved (not removed)"" loading time though at the cost of using even more of your PC resources. While Starfield dev feel like they don't care and abandoned it cause of the bad reviews still (even No Man Sky is good now despite the bad launch), that Star Wars mod has alot of passion behind it. There's even a YouTube channel showcasing that mod update, so you can look that up if you want.

I think they also once said ""We wanted to make a game that has unlimited replayability just like Skyrim"", and there you have it, they made a bad game that can ONLY be good through mods unlike Skyrim through alot of people eyes. I'm not saying it has to be as good as Skyrim for us to have fun, I'm only comparing it cause Skyrim is the most popular Elder Scrolls game, but this isn't even close, it's not even comparable. Alot of issues I mentioned didn't existed in Elder Scrolls and Fallout for example, hack even Elder Scrolls Online has better reviews despite it being a MMORPG, though even that had a bad launch, so I can only hope Starfield could make a comeback too, though I feel it should had been good from the start, atleast it's better late than never. But the biggest reason most for wanting to get this would probably be because of the mod, not Starfield itself, with Star Wars Genesis being the only massive modpack right now, but it'll probably be easier for people to mod once they finish updating the game, reason why is because update can break the mod so more should be willing to mod the game when that's over, not saying game will be good by the point though hopefully it will be, Skyrim has many modpack with only 1 modpack containing 2,000+ mods all at once for example, Starfield currently only have 1 modpack which is Star Wars Genesis and that currently has 200+ mods which is still alot, that's actually why Skyrim Anniversary DLC has bad reviews cause that broke alot of the existing mods, I don't think that's a good mindset to go through like shouldn't be the reason to buy AAA game but that's how dev decided to approach this, hopefully Elder Scrolls 6 won't get that same treatment. Funny that Starfield failed, Star Wars Outlaw failed, but the only modpack in Starfield aka Star Wars Genesis succeed over both of them, so you don't have to get Star Wars Outlaw either cause that modpack exist in Starfield, unless you want to get both or something.",False,3,2993

Gameplay is solid, although i wish they would've replaced the regular guns with more blasters instead seeing how this is a space game in the future but thats whatever. Performance is such a massive relief from these other modern horrible games that dont even care to put any optimization at all into their game. Steady high fps all on ultra, i literally sighed with relief because i get literally no hitches nor lag its as smooth as your girlfriends arse. But i think ultimately what holds this game back is a painfully average main storyline which isnt even 40% of the game anyways and the main npcs which.... i mean sam coe is the most useless, walked on, p-word man ive ever met and im not even lying. Everything you do sam will dislike it and then will cry to you for hours on end about some sort of k-drama bs story that he has in his life. If i could id open up the airlocks in space and have sam jump out but i cant. But besides those downsides its really not that bad as much as people say it is.

Starfield,1716740,196019996,"Today, I wanted to check on how the reviews were doing and it's not surprising that this game has lost a significant amount of core rpg players. I will provide my long-time been simmering opinion on the game.

[h3] [FOR VENT / OLDER BETHESDA FANS] [/h3]
On the premise of providing a classic rpg for the new generation, it failed.
On the premise of providing an amazing space rpg, it surprised on certain areas (ships, outposts, and planet exploration) yet it failed ultimately.
I think some people really do not know how much we enjoyed Elder Scrolls Bethesda despite its technical flaws, and even the awfully hilarious npc behaviors, and seeing a similar experience (one that did not improve on its core flaws) on a high-end hardware requirement setup was heartbreaking, still disappointing.
The promises were made, the hype was there, despite the pricetag and launch flaws I bought it at the time. On the same machinery I once played Skyrim, I haven't seen a Bethesda that improved on what mattered, but instead added fancy features and graphics to visually catch-up with its competitors / peers.
I have downgraded my experience of course to at the least give it a go and see if there was core value to play this game, despite the requirements. There wasn't. And imagine how much longer I would play if I really enjoyed the game.

[h3] [FOR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS] [/h3]
If you have a computer that is within recommended requirements AND have seen an aspect of the game you want to try ( space exploration, ship building/combat, dungeon delving, outpost building );
I still recommend watching videos about it to really make sure you want to give it a go. You don't want to end up with a hole in your wallet for a one-night experience.

If you have the recommended machinery specs AND want to see what Bethesda offers in Starfield overall as a space rpg;
I recommend being an old Bethesda fan/player/customer and being familiar with their ""storytelling"", erratic gameEngine behaviors, funny interactions and really game-y (fast food-ish) rpg taste. I do not find it bad whatsoever (maybe also because Skyrim was my first open-world rpg experience). It is just awful to see it on a 2023 release game that had a big mouth on its pre-release phase.

God....I wanted to love this game. It's got everything I would like, on paper. Cool setting, neat, solar-punk early space age art style, lots of loving throwbacks to older science-fiction tropes. If this was just fallout 4 in space, I would have probably been pretty happy.
But then, there's the actual meat and potatoes of the game. So, so much about the way everything in this game is set up, from the UI, to the main story quest, to the design of the planets themselves, feels rushed and cheap. Planet outposts are copy and paste, you WILL run into the same building layouts over and over again within the first few hours of play. Space exploration is famously limited, relying on load screens to get you from planet-orbit-system. Load screen to load screen to load screen, actually. Just creation engine things. 
When it's fallout or skyrim, and the only real load screens you see are entering and exiting building cells and dungeons, it's not really as noticeable, but try to get from the meeting table at the Lodge to the starport in New Atlantis and count the load screens. Just really immersion breaking in a game all about keeping you immersed, could've maybe hidden these cell changes with animations or something, riding an elevator, sitting in the tram, going bleep-boop with the buttons on the ship console when traveling, something that makes me feel like I am at least still in the game. I think the gravity drive does this well, it's a nice transition between places, but it's the only time in the game that happens.
Todd says this game took EIGHT YEARS to develop....how? 7 years to whip the ancient, barely functional creation engine into something useful and a year to develop the game, maybe. He says they wanted even more development time which sounds crazy, but I really feel like this needed possibly another 5 years in development. I would MAYBE recommend getting it on sale, if you really, really, like bethsoft RPGs. Otherwise, I would probably avoid.

I spent over 130 hours in this game, and, while initially I was enthralled and having a good time, the gameplay and story quickly became clunky, poor and boring. In any other bethesda game you will *always* find something interesting between locations. This is not the case in starfield, it is an empty barren mess with the same POI copy and pasted on uninteresting worlds. it is rocks, hills, and the occasional bit of life whether it be some grass, a plant or some weird animal.
The main quest, while again, interesting at first, quickly falls flat, becoming a mix of loading screens, caves, funny pieces of metal and ancient temples you spend an odd 5 to 10 minutes walking to before doing some weird zero gravity floating light thing to get a super power. The companions are mostly uninteresting and two dimensional as well.
The faction quests aren't *great*, but they are at the least good. I haven't much to say about them besides how I think they're the most engaging story content in this game. 

I do have some positives about this game, building starships is incredibly fun, though a bit restrictive in areas like how some of it is locked behind perk trees and ludicrous prices that are insane to save up for (especially considering how little payout you get from many activities in the game)
Character customisation was a highlight for me, I enjoyed being able to choose a background and have it appear once in a while through dialogue, it was a far improvement on fallout 4s character creation.

It is possible, if slightly improbable, that in 5 to 10 years, this game will have received the same modding treatment as fallout 4, in which case, I imagine the community will create quality content for the game as the Bethesda modding community always has. 
I really hope that in however long I can recommend this game through modding, however bare in mind that this should not be the standard, a game should not need to be intensely modded to be fun, especially considering how much of a pain in the ass it is at the moment.

Guys, fellow gamers — I gave this game [b]136 hours[/b] of my life.
I still haven’t finished it, and honestly, I’m not sure I ever will.

It’s not exactly a bad game. It has those classic Bethesda faction questlines, a mid-tier main story, and the usual pile of bugs. I’m used to bugs in the TES series — I grew up on them. But if there’s one thing [b]Starfield[/b] really excels at, it’s [i]scaling the chaos up[/i].

Broken saves? [i]Sure.[/i]
A pirate base that unmoors from its planet and follows you across the galaxy? [i]Of course.[/i]
A grind system more boring than learning Shouts in Skyrim? [i]Why not.[/i]
Atlantic City assets teleporting behind your ship? [i]Bethesda says hi.[/i]

And none of this is fixable through console commands or mods. You just have to [b]start over[/b].

The real issue? The game [i]isn’t fun at its core.[/i] It’s packed with odd design choices:
[list]
[*] No city maps at launch  
[*] Planet exploration is [i]painfully boring[/i] — like No Man’s Sky resource grinding, minus the joy  
[*] A lifeless crafting system with [b]hundreds of pointless materials[/b]  
[*] An overall vibe that sometimes feels more suffocating than [i]Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2[/i] — and I actually liked that game  
[/list]

Even if you remove all the bugs, Starfield still struggles as a game. And in its [i]current[/i] state? Plenty of those bugs are [b]still there[/b] (hello, flickering lights with DLSS...).

[h2]Final thoughts[/h2]
Starfield is a massive disappointment.

The saddest part? TES fans like me stick around because of the nostalgia — the side quests, the exploration, our ridiculously high tolerance for bugs. But the game gives nothing in return except frustration.

Come on.

Then, I spent more time trying to find storage space than actually being able to enjoy the gameplay and missions. That was already a dealbreaker. This Fallout mechanic of ""everything is looteable"" is way outdated. Fallout players like myself doesn't want to deal with this kind of boring mechanics any more. We just want to play the thing. 

Also, combat. For a self-called Role Playing Game, a combat mechanic thats way too arcade-ish and non creative. You just, you know, shoot around. And remove hitpoints of the target.

I recently picked it up on sale (for about 50% off) and started playing again. I must say after cooking for a little while longer the game seems much better. It's looking and performing quite nicely on my system and the AI seems a bit more polished, even in combat. I can see how the public holds Bethesda to high standards and that some might be disappointed as the game might not have been exactly what they expected but I'm pretty satisfied with where it is and would recommend to players who enjoy a Mass Effect/No Man's Sky type feel with a really good story arch. Yes, it has a sort of classic Jules Verne innocence to it but that appeals to me. The music score and sound are very complementary (Cinematic dare I say). I haven't heard any F bombs or seen anyone hacked to pieces by a chainsaw yet but it still deals with adult themes in a PG-13 kind of way (If you want something more carnal the Doom franchise has got you covered). I think I had about 20 or 30 hours into it on Game Pass, did not previously finish the main campaign but my replay so far has been very satisfying as it seems to have improved quite a bit since launch. I love all of the detailing that was put into interfaces and objects. Vasco and the Frontier ship are super cool looking to me with its retro/modern combination aesthetic. This is very well done throughout the game so far.  I wish you could actually do a little more in unexpected ways (like other Bethesda titles) with some of the NPC's but this does help to keep the main story on track without getting too terribly distracted. The miners definitely don't appreciate getting clipped by a cutter. Its a fun game that ticks most of the boxes for me.

[h2]TL;DR[/h2]

[h2]What Works[/h2]
[list]
[*][b]World-building is top-tier[/b] — factions, lore, cities, and the endless vacuum of space all feel immersive and distinctly Bethesda
[*][b]Ship customization and combat[/b] are highlights — building your own spaceship and dogfighting in zero-G never gets old
[*][b]Quest design and RPG elements[/b] — classic Bethesda goodness: moral dilemmas, weird side quests, and memorable characters
[*][b]Graphics and atmosphere[/b] — gorgeous planetary surfaces and space vistas make exploration screenshot-worthy
[/list]

[h2]What Needs Work[/h2]
[list]
[*]The space travel loop gets repetitive — lots of menus, fast travel, and loading screens break the immersion over time
[*]Procedural planets feel a bit… procedural — not every rock needs a story, but some feel like copy-paste galactic filler
[*]Inventory and encumbrance management is classic Bethesda — and not in the good way
[/list]

[h2]Worth Knowing[/h2]
[list]
[*]This is very much a Bethesda RPG in space — if you liked Skyrim or Fallout 4, you’ll feel right at home
[*]Modding community is already heating up — expect this to be an entirely different (and better) game in a year or two. I personally can't wait to see the world transformed into the Stargate SG1 Universe. 
[*]Performance is decent but still occasionally janky — it's tradition at this point

[i]Starfield nails the feeling of exploring a massive galaxy with all the charm and clunk you’d expect from a Bethesda epic. While the travel system lacks the thrill of real-time spaceflight and can feel repetitive, the core of the game — the quests, the world-building, the freedom — is rock solid. It might not be the future of space RPGs, but it’s a strong first step onto a bigger stage.[/i]

Starfield,1716740,195655494,"The game is beautiful, but an inconsistent mess.

It teases you with many romantic sci-fi tropes that are hidden behind many, many, many layers and hours of bad interaction designs.

It's like they're lying to me all the time. And they are. But are they all?


For example:

- It can clearly render a moving spaceship's interior, multiple buildings' interiors, a city, and a generated world surface simultaneously.
But half the doors have loading screens.

- The story themes and concepts are great, some of my favorites.
But the writings are mostly poor, too stereotypical, and talk too much redundantly, often over each other.
i.e.
NPC: Blabla- Are you sure you're ready?
Player: Let's do this.
N: Dam right. You must be so eager to -blabla-.
P: Ready when you are.
N: It's about time. You know, this reminds me -blabla-.
P: We should get on with it.
NPC: -blablablablabla-
*quest updates, *quicksave, *shoots his face, *savescums, *'why am I on this go-there-and-talk quest for 2 hours? don't they have email or something?'

- You can walk around your ship while your ship moves. Even go around a planet or its many moons in real-time if you can go fast enough (like, 100,000 ~ 100,000,000,000 times of the ship's maximum speed).
But only with a mod can those be triggered.
But those only needed to be triggered. They were already in the game. Why weren't they used, and instead most space travels are sudo-fast-travels?

- The visual aesthetic is seemingly focused on realism, also seemingly well-researched and detailed one at that.
The gameplay is nothing but. How the damage works, stats, crafting, ship physics (the non-existence of it), inventory management, and lasers don't do laser things (recoil and ""projectile"" speed).
If they had either gone with this game mechanic with stylish visual, or this visual with hard science realism, it would have been easier to digest.
The way it is now, though, it feels like I'm eating a roasted mushroom with strawberry jam, kinda gross. (And you know what's worse? I ended up liking it!)

- The combat can be realistic and tense, killing you or the enemy in a couple of shots with any guns, instead of stat-based bullet sponges.
But those settings are kinda hidden in the options, and not the default setting for this ""seemingly realistic"" world.

- You have a jet pack and can run fairly fast all the time. Stairs are pretty steep, too.
But can't go over an ankle-high rock without jumping.
So I jump, mid-combat, in haste. And, oh, it's 0.26 gravity. Now I have no cover for an entire duration of a yawn. *ded.

- The interaction with the UI is horrendous.
It's a long list. 
I'll just say, if this is their entertainment UI, I feel bad for their management UI. Clearly, a whole lot of people are not paid enough for their mental well-being.

- The game complements the modding community. A great community, as usual.
But it also sabotages them and itself with some updates.
It's like being a pretty bad host for their paid guests, sometimes.
And why keep putting more effort into making more mess instead of fixing known issues, I do not know.

and etc.



The first 26 hours of this game were so frustrating. I hated this game.
But I insisted. Because it felt like there was something in here.
Eventually, I found it, and now I'm at New Game +2 and over 200 hrs, my favorite activity being just landing on a random planet and walking around (if I can survive) or designing a colony or a ship.
I still hate most quests and all ""cities"".

So it's difficult to pin a like or dislike on this game.
Steam asks, ""Do you recommend this game?""
To my friends? I absolutely do not. This is a huge time sink with a lot of confusion.

There is some alien life on some planets and there is a whole galaxy to explore. I played when the game first came out. It was rough. But after a bit of time, it runs good, looks good, added lots to do if you know where to look. The dialogue options can lead to different outcomes. npcs remember certain things about you and the gameplay is easy to learn. crafting system is cool, and easy to learn. Think of skyrim but less uga duga hack and slash and more story driven and exploration driven. best part is you can be whoever you wanna be. Wanna be a spy? you got it. Space pirate? sure. most wanted criminal or thief? sure. This game lets you mold it into what you want it to be. Most planets are barren and empty yes but in a way its realistic. planets discovered in space irl are the same way. what I do agree with is they should have added an alien race planet somewhere. most complaints from what I read are small little things people find anything to gripe about. My advice is give it a chance. Try it on game pass or pick it up and play for a couple hours. I think its worth it and pretty damn fun. It scratches the itch like skyrim/ oblivion for me at least.

Starfield,1716740,195649386,"1000 Hours played. My favourite way of playing this game is to create different characters. So far, I have made 50 each with slightly different skill sets and abilities. I then take these and see how well I do

Getting the right skills and traits is important to the character so it is fun to try different ones for the different characters. I have found hand to hand useless. Duelling can be OK IF it is paired with a weapon as this helps increase the concealment skill. I do not recommend full Duelling as you will miss out on all the great weapons available

All in all a great game to play as you always find something different no matter how many times you play through it

A decent Bethesda-like-RPG. Pros:

- Interesting side quests
- Good lore
- Starship and outpost builders
- interesting leveling system, where you need to work for your skills
- music
- easy to jump into
-persuade and hacking minigames are actually nice

Cons:

- main quest seems like it was written by high school fresheman
- space battles looks more like arcade shooters
- unstable and bugged
- if you install mods, they will turn off your achivements; only way to prevent this is to buy paid versions
- ugly people! common Bethesda, nobody wants to play DEI simulators! not even DEI supporters
- mechanically bad; boss battles are merly annoyance
- although you can recruit multiple crewmen, there are only really 4 companions with quests and personality (excluding moded ones);
- fast travel mechanics prevent you from exploration
- tedious and repeatable exploration, only bareable if you have downloaded rover dlc

What's the gunplay like, you say curiously.  
What about the impact of choices, do they matter at all?

My answer to all your questions? I don't know.  I don't know, because I can't make it passed the first mission. At first, it's some stutters, forcing me to slow down and check my phone while things come back.  Then the very first pirate ship lands at the very start of the game, right after I create my character.  Then it freezes.  Sometime I can have a one frame per second firefight, other times it crashes.  I have never made it passed the first pirate base you have to clear because of how poorly optimized this game is.

You may say it's my fault, trying to run this game on a terrible PC.  Well, no.  I got a pretty good rig and have selected ""Low"" on all graphic settings.  I can run games like Delta Force, a massive multiplayer game that is in beta and developed by a studio that doesn't have the backing of one of the largest and most well known gaming companies.  I can run FO4 with ungodly amounts of mods with no/very few crashes or stutters.  I can run late game HoI4 and Stellaris with no crashes or stutters (a grand achievement if you don't know).  I literally have never had a problem with any game I own unless they were having trouble with their servers.  This is a Starfield problem.

Starfield,1716740,195376376,"A space exploration game with nothing to explore. 1000 planets with the same dozen or so installations that are all exact copies of themselves. Same layout, same loot in the exact same spot, same enemies with the same weapons in the same locations.  All alien life is either a bug or a dinosaur and they all act exactly the same, which is to charge the player while you yank the trigger and wait for them to die. Planets are randomly generated so one can be -20 temp and you get 'extreme cold' effects while another can be -170 with no effect. Nonsensical.

A space combat system that is pure arcade and is just 'hold trigger until enemy ship blows up'. Every ship moves and feels like every other ship.

Ground/internal ship combat has a ridiculously stupid AI with enemies that are literally bullet sponges. They often just stand still while you pump round after round directly into their heads until they die. The game completely ignores what happens when you put a bullet through a space suit/helmet on a planet with no atmosphere.

The main story line is supremely boring and pointless. I forced myself to finish it and start NG only to realize that it's the same thing with a few minor changes. The thought of having to slog through every repetitive quest just to reset the game so I could do it yet again made me truly understand the concept of 'ennui' and nihilism. I only lasted an hour or so in NG before uninstalling the game.

I love equipment modding/upgrading in games but in Starfield there is no point. It's incredibly grindy and you will loot better equipment from enemies or chests. Outpost building is similarly grindy. Why do I need to build my own coffee table for my outpost? There's no such thing as a Space Ikea? Seriously, I can become a cargo jockey and transport minerals etc to every settled world, but no one can deliver a lamp or a chair?

Finally, the NPC's. They are all utterly bland and boring and are essentially minor variations of the same archetype (good). The voice acting is atrocious, at least the English versions are. Why do they all speak at a speed that's about half of actual humans? I did the companion quests more out of duty than interest. I can't say that I truly cared about any of them and when the big story shock happened and one of them died, I really could only say ""I didn't like her anyway.""

The only semi-bright spot in the game is the ship building, once you figure out how it works.  It's cool to be able to build your own ship that you can actually walk around inside. However that's about all you can do. You don't actually fly it anywhere and all of the modules from the various vendors are just cosmetic variations of the same thing  The ship combat is exactly the same for every ship.

I could go on but I think that covers my main critiques.

I’m very upset I got an update to fix nonexistent problems and all it did was give me those exact problems. It got so bad with half loading games I final quit! I haven’t played since the first big update and I was enjoying myself! I would recommend the game but be aware of this! Idk how it will affect you!,True,1,14570

Starfield,1716740,195319442,"TL;DR:
The question that Starfield raises for me: What is it that this game brings to the table that isn't already brought by...

Fallout: New Vegas, Skyrim, Fallout 4, No Man's Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, Oblivion Remastered, and so on

...that makes it uniquely worth buying? Especially when I'm pretty sure 100% of those games I listed are, at time of writing, cheaper than Starfield?

VERY LONG; DID READ:
I feel like the counterarguments for people not liking Starfield either boil down to ""you didn't play it long enough; it gets better later"", or the opposite, ""Well, you played it for X hours; nobody plays a game they don't like for that long, so clearly you actually like it."" But, like, the sunk cost fallacy exists, and is on full display here.

I really WANT Starfield to be good. The NASApunk vibes are immaculate and I DON'T think the game would be improved by adding sentient alien species or anything like that. There are hints of moments where the game is real neat: The propaganda hallway in the UC Vanguard orientation. Most of the Ryujin Industries questline. Some of the interactions introduced by traits, especially Kid Stuff. 

And, maybe an unpopular opinion, but I actually love the simplistic tedium of the scanning system.


But Starfield feels like the sterile, family-friendly theme park land of a much more nuanced and mature setting, which lacks any theme or message, because having a theme or message makes it harder to get kids to beg their parents to ride the Constellation roller coaster One. More. Time.

Maybe the theme of the game is supposed to be hope and human perseverance. I'd honestly love a sci-fi game that's just unapologetically optimistic. But Starfield isn't that. There's clear poverty and class disparity everywhere, there's infighting over territory in a universe where there's SO much unused space that it's clear that this greed has nothing to do with any demonstrable need.

So then maybe it's a game about the cruel and greedy face beneath a world of sterile propaganda. Which also would've been great if it leaned into that. But it doesn't. There are plenty of instances where you see hints of an ugly side of a seemingly-benevolent group, but those are always swept under the rug, and never in a way that feels intentional. A more competent game would either allow you unravel and tear those systems down, OR beat into you that you're ultimately powerless against this unstoppable engine of greed, so the best you can do is keep your head down and get yours. Starfield does neither. Most of the hints of real conflict or depth feel less intentional and thought-provoking, and more ""We thought this would be a cool set piece. Don't think too hard about it.""

Then is it a game about exploration and appreciating the vastness of space? Well, with the game's focus on fast travel, exploration doesn't really feel organic in the same way it did in pretty much every Bethesda game since Oblivion. Yes, sometimes you find cool locations. Sometimes you get wowed and humbled by the emptiness of space. But most of the time, you're just kinda chilling on some rocks and you see an abandoned space gas station that's inexplicably out in the middle of a barren planet. You almost never stumble on a weird rabbit hole on your way to something else and forget what you were originally doing, which has always felt like a big part of the Bethesda Magic.",False,6,8419

Equipped with the nano suit from crysis with a lightsaber, a star wars blaster and the doom shotgun. Me and Alejandra in a swimsuit naturally start fighting the enemies in the base and suddenly a AT-ST boss spawns in and starts shooting at us. I fly to higher ground and the AT-ST gets stuck under a cliff bugging out but allowing me to kill the bounty with a increased bounty reward of 10,000 credits. I then jump into my flying space bike and start shooting at the At-st which is stuck but insta-kills me anyways I'm under leveled so I decide to leave the planet on my Star wars Nubian Royal spaceship.

Is Starfield the perfect space game nope not even close does it have rough performance and a ton of bugs yep but which betheseda game doesn't! I originally played starfield at launch with gamepass it was fine nothing too special really. But now that I came back to it over a year later with full mods loaded THIS is what I dreamed of when Starfield was announced. What I just played literally can't be experienced anywhere else in other games are other games better overall absolutely. But if you set your expectation accordingly and install many mods Starfield can be a lot of fun for a space game from betheseda. Skyrim and Fallout 4 are much better games for sure. With more time Starfield will only improve there is only one way and that is up. I recommend this game but only on Sale it really isn't worth 70$ simply due to it's bad performance issues and lack of good content without mods.

The game can feel short, it's very easy to breeze through the main story. It is an interesting story in my opinion and more interesting to me are the parts that feel very meta for Bethesda games. Procedural generation ruins a lot of the fun of finding handcrafted locations made by Bethesda. It can still be fun the first few times you discover locations but you'll very quickly recognize subsequent appearances of those locations. There's also a ton of loading screens, not entirely unusual for a Bethesda game but even by that standard there's a lot. 

With those flaws and shortcomings in mind though, there's so much *good* in Starfield. The game is visually breathtaking, so many stunning locations and if you're a space fan in general there's just so much to take in out there. The designs and themes for ships and spacesuits and everything is fairly unique as well. Ship-building is fantastic fun. The cast of characters at Constellation and the backstory for the different factions feels like a great foundation that I hope they continue to build upon in the future.

If you FORCE yourself to play as a good guy, the story is nice.

The ships are good looking, but that's it.

The gameplay is pretty fun.

The bad things about it:

Companions and romances are nice. IF YOU ARE A GOOD GUY, bad guys don't have companions or romances, only mercenaries. wow.

The space combat is decent. But you have little to no control of your ship outside of that. Engine limitation or laziness.

The settlements are nice to build, but you can like avoid that they are not as cool and interactable as the ones you can make in fallout 4.

If you join the bad guys they actually stop attacking you when you encounter them, pretty cool right? Well ""the good guys"" however will never attack you. congrats no more enemies in the game if you turn evil.

THE WORST THING IN THE GAME:

THE LOADINGS, YOU WILL  SPEND AT LEAST 15% OF YOUR PLAYTIME JUST LOADING, LOADING AND LOADING. Sorry for the vent. But fcking hell it's horrible. Everywhere you go there are at least 3 different loadings for 3 different places all next to each other where you need to follow/talk to NPC.  it's all separated. It's fcking bad.

The sheer scope of systems and mechanics at play keeps things fresh—even after over 200 hours of gameplay, there's still plenty left for me to discover and experiment with.

That said, not everything has landed perfectly for me. One of the weaker aspects, in my opinion, is the quest design in the base game. Many of the objectives feel formulaic or disjointed, and the reliance on fast travel between key points really breaks the sense of immersion and continuity. It often feels more like ticking off a checklist than being part of a living, breathing world.

Interestingly, I found the quest structure in Shattered Space to be much more engaging.

I came back to this over a month ago and dumped another 80 hrs in, this time downloading a couple community mods ""creations"". I picked an alternate start 'mod' which allowed me to immediately explore. Despite this being a role playing game, the writing still pulled me out of my enjoyment time and time again. ""Yes ma'am, it's a damned honor to meet you"" and other similar personality-shredding statements being forced dialogue options Sucks. The [persuade] dialogues being nonsensical, followed by NPCs reacting as if I had intimidated/threatened/annoyed them into submission broke any feeling of social control I felt over my character as well. There is a margin of this that I can forgive, especially in games like fallout 4 where the character is voiced, but in Starfield I do not get to play the character I want to. I am MADE not to by the writing consistently. It is thoughtless in comparison to the other Bethesda games. No amount of mods will change that. You are forced to play a Bootlicking Loser in a Significant percentage of the questlines. 

The ship-building had me running back and forth between my ship and the technician over and over again to see how the doors unpredictably connected, how the ladders got randomly placed and whether they connect at all. Room elements including crafting tables, of which there are 5 kinds, get removed as a result of doorway or ladder placement. Any manual room decorating/customization you had done gets wiped if you connect a new room or shift its placement. There is No way to preview or control these things in the builder. You have to Manually save frequently while doing this as well, because if you make changes, check and hate it, the only way to go back to your customized well decorated interior is by reloading. I genuinely felt so much satisfaction from putting together a well organized, well decorated, functional ship. 10 hours of gameplay later I have access to better ship pieces and I have to shift things around, losing my hard fought customizations if I want to keep up with level scaling or expand my crew. It leads to so much investment and so much Loss over and over. Even if you couldn't care less about aesthetic, your ship will be nonsensical and nonfunctional if you don't take the time to do multiple trips back and forth to the technician making sure the doors and ladders don't eliminate your purchased worktables and interactables.

I dragged out completing the game, because I was constantly finding new things and getting absorbed in the role playing, the base building, the leveling. At some point, I finally started looking at reviews -- and was *shocked* at how much people hate this game. It's upsetting to realize that people who don't want the game have likely ruined the chance for it to be iterated on and made even better.

I have the advantage of never playing a BGS game before, I think. I was able to take this game as a stand-alone experience. I also hadn't been plugged into the hype, and got into it with zero expectations. I can't relate with most people who have found the game disappointing (or worse).

The story telling is delightful. The depth and intricacies of the quest lines are largely amazing, and the simple dumb ones are (usually) amusing. The grinding feels at a minimum, and totally optional. The skill tree stressed me out at first, but it's not like I was being prevented from doing things in the game at lower levels. I spent 375ish hours on my first playthru, being pretty thorough, and apparently still left things undone.

It's a piece of art made by people, which means there are flaws. I spent something like 12 hours messing with the outpost system, absolutely entranced in the process of building a system that fed raw mats into manufacturing -- then realized that was it, I'd maxed it out and probably never needed to touch it again. There's glitches, a couple borked quests, inventory issues. Some quest lines DO feel half-finished, or wrap unsatisfactorily. But none of this has stopped me from being sucked into the universe.

If you enjoy RPGs, space operas, gun/laser fights, and having options that aren't always ""Shoot this NPC"" then you'll enjoy Starfield. Extra so, if you're willing to enjoy something for what it IS instead of hating it for what it isn't.",True,60,28806

Starfield,1716740,194922351,"The game is not bad. It's just doesn't give me that ""Oh, a new elderscrolls game!"" feeling. 1000 kilometers wide, 10 cm deep. Still, I'm close to 700 hours with several characters played at the time of writing this.

Most of the world generation is pretty nice and well done, it's just the outposts feel copy pasted into the game world and not adapted for it's environment, as an example i ran into an abandoned farm recently.... On Mars. What were the settlers thinking? And some settlers walk around in freezing cold (-30'C) or without a environmental suit on planets that would kill them in seconds, which breaks immersion.

The space combat is good, the storyline (main game) is ok, the side quests are awesome (Groundpounder, Crimson and Vanguard), but i found the (first) DLC to be a bit like they tried to make a Shivering Isles expansion to a space game.

Major plus points for NewGame+, but it only have so many rewarding levels. I'm at NG+16 on one character and the rewards kind of dwindle out after NG+15. There are some new dialogues you can say as you reenter the game, but there is not enough of them.

Did i like StarField? Yes. Did i expect new? Also yes. It would be better for Bethesda to make this game go it's on way instead of trying to slap an Elderscrolls magic DLCs onto it, a Fallout type of DLC would be better, like some ""far harbour"" thing that opens up a wormhole that took you to a new set of star systems closer to the galaxy core with new factions or even an alien civilization. There are plenty of options to step away from their traditional game design formula and create something new.

Bethesda said that they are going to support this game for 10 years. I hope they do so and don't look back at what they have already done and go in a new direction. That would include a new game engine, and i think their experiment with Oblivion Remastered and Unreal Engine 5 is a good thing - too bad they didn't do that earlier and could have made StarField into a spectacular gaming experience.

Bethesdas track record hasn't been good since Fallout 76 and they need to shape up, i think complacency has gotten to their studio. For now, as a gamer who like exploration and space, i give StarField a B+ - while hopeing that they go for an A++.

It runs great and is pretty stable. The questlines are really good. The UC Vanguard is probably Bethesda's best but the main storyline is one of their worst. It's not uncommon for their main quests to be kind of bad but the gap in quality has never been this wide. There are some great individual missions in the main storyline but the overall arc is just kind of eh. 

Ship building is fun, weapon customization is cool, outposts are cool, surveying planets is a great mindless activity. The cities are too big. New Atlantis is too big. Akila is way too big. Neon is okay in size.  Look, I'm not a proponent of bigger is better. Skyrim feels so big because its cities and towns are conservatively sized. They feel alive because TES cities are so dense with things to do and named people to talk to. If there is just a massive sprawl like Akila with randoms everywhere with nothing going on except being set dressing it feels dead in a roundabout way. 

Regardless, the dungeons are decent, the gameplay is fun, character progression is neat. Its just missing a capital ""O"" Open World... That Bethesda is known for.

It's also missing immersion. I've been saying that immersive loading screens would legit boost the public opinion of the game by like 20%. Instead of loading screens when you warp or take off, the game lets to maintain control over the camera, and plays mist/star warp effects around the ship when you take off, land, or warp. The game rips control away from you when you do these things and fast travel is 90% of the game so make it immersive. Let us chart courses with the star map in the captains cabin too.

The game had tons of potential, but just kinda died. The DLC was horrid. Whoever thought making DLC for a space game that was basically on one planet was.. an idiot. The mods, for as great as they are, never really filled the gap like I was hoping. Just nothing but star wars mods, which is all good but not what I really wanted. Tried adding more NPC's, better visuals, every mod for cities, outposts, ships etc and it still felt absolutely lifeless. Maybe if they ever release another DLC I'll give it a shot but as of now, I'd say the game is dead.


I'm a space science fiction nerd. When Bethesda announced this game, I was instantly sold. I love Elder Scrolls, having sunk thousands of hours in, and Fallout easily having over 10K hours in just 4 alone. I teeter between recommend and don't recommend. 

-The story isn't bad, I have my complaints and know people do too, but I think a lot of that is due to people having huge expectations. I can admit my early complaints were me just expecting a Skyrim caliber game. When I stood back and took it for what it was, it was the beginning of a story. Elder Scrolls started long ago, just as Fallout did, this is just new.

-I loved the Fallout 4 settlement building system, and was hoping for something similar.  It does have elements from it, but there is a lot to be desired. The ship building is the same way, after learning to use the frustrating ship builder it is fun coming up with all sorts of creations. I'm hoping in a future update they'll add more types of build-able ships.

- There's a lot to do, side quests, bounty hunter, faction quests. One of my main gripes though is how you can be cool with two opposing folks and nothing happen. I want consequences! New Vegas style factions. I miss the days of smarting off to the NPC and they just attack you.

- The cities are cool, but they're kinda bland. I understand the limitations for NPCs, but somehow Megaton felt more lively than Neon. I expected maybe 3-5 cities per ""core"" planet, one large and a few smaller. I am to believe the capital for the entire Freestar is in this run-down alamo looking city with like 40 folks?

- Space exploration is fun, but still feels like it is missing something. Going to a planet that is inhospitable has 30 different types of Outposts on it. Kind of takes away from the immersion I suppose. Didn't level up to build a base here just so some level 2 Raiders can shoot at my buildings for 2 hours. 

In the end, I love it for what it is, but mostly for what it could be still. I'd assume mods would have fixed a lot of these gripes, but it seems there's just hard limitations to what is allowable.",False,0,66498

The game is your typical Bethesda game, with its quirks and perks but if you ask me, it was very immersive the whole time. Not necessarily because of RPG choices but just because of design, dialogues (voice acting), ability to build your own ship and walk IN it etc etc. Graphically very valid, the main quest really engaging and every substory with the various factions is also very well made.
Flying is fun enough, combat is simple. 
Of course as everybody knows there is no manual landing or taking off, but the ""cutscenes"" with the ship animations are very nice and never the same. Loading screens? Never lasted more than 2 or 3 seconds.
You don't want to fly? Fine, you can fast travel pretty much wherever you want. You like roleplaying? Then walk everywhere, get on your ship and walk to your cockpit...anything is possible.

Tried some achievement-friendly creations and found a few that improve my perception of the game without messing with the mechanics.

However, this comes with a disclaimer – discovering the game mechanics, some of which are poorly explained or not explained at all, was and still is a big part of what makes Starfield interesting to me. With that in mind, I strongly recommend any newcomer to not cheese the game and opt out of any ""best way to do X"" guides at least at the beginning. As with any Bethesda game, it is beatable without the need to be perfect and/or min-max. Trivializing the game is almost guaranteed to make it extremely boring. It's an exploration game after all – don't let someone else do the exploration for you.

Also – and this is pretty opinionated – ignore all the ""you should rush NG+ X"" advice (where X is any number above 2, usually 10) until you discover for yourself what it is and what it brings: the role-playing dilemma, consequences, and so on. The NG+ rush itself is absolutely boring and will likely turn you off the game if that's your first experience with it.

Cyberpunk is unplayable to this day, whereas it only took some months for Bethesda to polish this up. I expected wayyy more bugs than I encountered. It is less buggy than Skyrim). Perhaps lack of originality when it comes to similarities to No Man's Sky.
Must be played on SSD. 

Pros: Controls+Mechanics, the gameplay , most of the story, the ""sensation"" of being in space. The simulation aspect that Bethesda is known for specializing in really hits home in this.

Only slightly less disappointing than Fallout 76 which may be alright after the years but lost my interest after the lifeless no-npc launch.

Starfield,1716740,194510204,"I wanted to love this game when i bought it. It was exciting at first. A new IP from Bethesda, the maker of some of my favorite games. It seemed like it had the bones to be the next one to hold that title. I ignored the haters for the first 30 or so hours (thought they were crazy, even). The graphics are great, the action is fluid, and the ship-building is easily the most engaging system I've ever seen. 

Then it sets in. The story is paint-by-numbers. You can choose from about 4 different paths, but they all go to the same place. The player character build and progression doesn't feel rewarding. The special abilities are useless and can be ignored entirely. The research system is a slog but failing to invest in it completely locks you out of gear customization. The combat quickly becomes monotonous, especially the space combat, which is a tremendous shame (considering how great the ship-building mechanic is). Building outposts is somehow less rewarding than the same activity in vanilla Fallout 4. But perhaps the most damning thing is the feature that Bethesda touted the most - the universe they created. 

The best part of my favorite Bethesda games is exploring the world they dropped me in. Discovering things. Joining those who inhabit it and feeling like you are truly a part of it. Starfield has none of that. The world is lifeless. I've never met characters I cared less about. Some of the intentionally-designed settlements are interesting enough, but those are few and far between. Most of the places you will visit feel like they were cut-and-pasted from the same CAD file. Even if the planets aren't barren, they feel as though they may as well be (although many of them ARE, in fact, barren and devoid of anything worth investigating). The encounters are formulaic. Exploration becomes a chore. I've never had less of an issue avoiding side quests. Stepping through Unity to start it all over again feels more like penance than a reward. 

Some people will undoubtedly find some fun here, as I certainly did at times, but I expect most will come to the same conclusion I did - this game is a giant missed opportunity.

Starfield is, without a doubt, an absolute masterpiece in my eyes. From the moment I started playing, I was hooked by the atmosphere, the scale, and the sheer ambition of this game. It’s not just a space RPG – it’s a journey through a universe that feels alive, mysterious, and filled with wonder.

Pros:
	•	Incredible world-building: Every planet, space station, and city has its own unique vibe. Bethesda did an amazing job crafting a believable universe.
	•	Freedom of exploration: You can go anywhere, do anything, and play the game your way. Whether you’re a space pirate, explorer, or diplomat, there’s room for all playstyles.
	•	Immersive storytelling: The main story and side quests are engaging, with deep lore and well-written characters.
	•	Customization: From your ship to your gear to your character, the level of customization is fantastic.

Cons:
	•	Bugs and glitches: Yes, there are quite a few, and some can be frustrating. But they never took away from the overall experience for me.
	•	Loading screens: There are a lot of them, especially between planets or locations, which can break immersion at times.

Despite the technical issues, I genuinely believe Starfield is a game that will be remembered for years. It’s not perfect – far from it – but the heart, soul, and vision behind it shine through. I can’t stop playing it, and I’m already excited for what modders and future updates will bring.

In skyrim at least you could wander around and discover unique locations. In starfield you land on a planet with a slightly different color palette or texture palette, with tweaked gravity, and then go find bleak falls barrow over and over again.

- Unfortunately due to NG+ you lose all your ships and designs every time. If there was a way to save your designs or upload them to the creation club or steam workshop then I wouldn't have to spend so much time rebuilding my design every time. 
- Door placement. not letting players choose where doors appear is the most backwards thing and makes me irrationally angry
-Only allowed to have a certain number of ships
- there is only ONE ship in the game that has a perk?? any of the factions could have had unique ship perks 



All in all unfortunately at the time of this review the content is just not there. I think they believed the community would hop on this like rats to a raft in the middle of the ocean but they didn't. There are mods out there but they just are not gaining much traction. If you read this (I doubt anyone will(Mostly just for me to rant about a game I wished could have been more)) and are looking to buy the game I would wait for the DLCs to come out as hopefully a miracle will occur and the game will get better. Your best bet is waiting for Elder scrolls 6.",False,1,24419

Starfield,1716740,194373907,"The game is just fun. Maybe it's the setting, but I am enjoying it at least as much as I did TES series, which I have played since Daggerfall. A bit part of the added enjoyment is the more personable companions, even if they don't match the depth and interest of Mass Effect (Bethesda, take note!). Something that would make the characters more alive would be to tie their affinity to certain quests and game events to pace out the relationships throughout the game rather than blasting through all their material right away. This would also encourage taking along different companions for different quests. 

Gameplay is a lot of fun. The quests and the story (so far) are engaging. Ship building is a lot of fun. The big criticism that the maps get repetitive and feel like reused is valid. At least the main quest maps and faction quest maps need to have more variety. In the future, the rest can be procedurally generated pretty effectively, I imagine. Procedurals have come a long way since Daggerfall's endless towns of identical houses.

Also, if they would have tied outpost building to the main quest (something like Mass Effect 3's galaxy map), that would give it more purpose rather than just a sandbox ""thing to do."" But I am just scratching the surface of outpost building at this point.

Starfield,1716740,194359663,"I give this a recommended rating, BUT I must say, that in order for this game to finally be something more than a 6/10, it just has to improve at least following aspects to be engaging and simply FUN:
- introduce SPACE ALIENS i.e. sentient aliens, that resemble humans in about the same ratio as aliens in Mass Effect. A game about space exploration where there are only humans and no other intelligent life is just so vanilla and self-centered on humanity, what becomes simply boring after a while.
- majority of the randomly generated maps/sectors on planets need to be made more interesting/varied and there should not be 5 minutes of running just to get to another mundane empty landmark which is just a stock asset and gives us nothing besides meaningless amount of ""finder's EXP"".
- too many loading screens in a game where you have to traverse many locations to get to the quest objective is really cumbersome...
- loot system has huge amount of Skyrim DNA in it... it already has been done to the death before, so loot could be make more interesting - we need more effects/attachments/functionalities added to the guns. Don't make guns be like a pew-pew space wazer wifles, but interesting Sci-Fi guns which could bring so novelty.
- many other obvious things others have pointed out.

In general I can leave this a recommended rating, but only as a sign/incentive for Bethseda to make Starfield not ""just work"", but finally work as a whole concept along with game mechanics being well thought-out.

In current state - if nothing particularly interesting gets introduced into the game and at least some of its annoyances are not eliminated, this might be that Bethesda game which may eventually fall into obscurity.

It's an RPG, not a story-based game, and not a simulator; you're not the main character of the universe, just the main character of your save file, which lends to a more unique experience to me. Starfield is cinematic as hell, so many interesting side quests, neat NPC interactions, and as usual with Bethesda games there is SO much replayability. It's not perfect, and a lot of people had too many expectations before launch, but honestly its just fun to explore. My biggest gripe is with the ~ console commands, as using any commands turns off achievements, which while it isn't a big issue it is still a pain in a Bethesda game which is as buggy as all their other RPGs. That said, I'm content that I paid regular price, but I wouldn't say it's worth the premium price.

The main story arc is shorter than expected, but it introduces you to the world and some of it's secrets well.

Playing faction quests is pretty much necessary if you wish to get that full Bethesda experience. I'm only at 91 hours so far into the game, but I already had enough fun with it to know that I got my money's worth.

The original vision seemingly had way more intense diseases and afflictions, a fuel system and more a involved food system. (there is so much food in the game you guys, you have no idea)
The planets actually rotate around their stars and most of the technology is so grounded that it feels believable. The Nasapunk fibe is so intense that you spend more than half your time in sterile off-white space interiors it's honestly impressive.
The allien life you find grows like they are in Jurrasic park, while around you the ambient storm sounds so real you are there.

It's clear that at some point Bethesda's playtesters saw their space-hero coming back from a firefight in a hostile environment, riddled with bullet- and burn-wounds, radiation poisoning and multiple infections. Their health more than cut in half. The medicine in their inventory only improved their situation a little bit, and sleeping did not cure them at all. They had to either be in safe environment for a while, or find a doctor. So they went to the cockpit on  their ship only to realise that they were out of fuel and stranded in space. The playtester would ask...is this fun for most people?

No, probably not, but it absolutely is for me! So I crank up all the survival mechanics to the max and I mod in even more! I want to be scared of leaving a safe planet, I want to hear my character coughing and groaning in pain while I struggle to survive in the harshest conditions. Only to relax after I hear the sound of a pressurised door close.

This is far from a perfect game. But I believe, if you're a gamer that likes to play it slow, enjoys roleplaying with their own gameplay rules and don't mind the existance of payed mods, this game has a lot for you.

The combat is either impossible or too easy. Sometimes NPCs fall through the floor and you can't finish quests.

REV getting stuck under my ship, on some rocks and one is that some dialogue choices get bugged out forcing to end the conversation when re-choosing back.

But all those bugs, I don't mind them that much. What's worse is the;
-THE PC(Politically Correct) language, the allied NPCs are all sooooo damn self-righteously annoying.
-You can't play a sarcastic, intimidating pirate as crimson fleet since they all treat you as a starry eyed rookie.
-Vanguard/MAST treats you like you didn't exist after everything. 
-Ryuuji Industries doesn't lead to anything more after, can't even call it a faction.
-Tracker only has 1 quest - the rest you have to pay real money aside from the game or DLC. 
-Freedom cowboy group has you singlehandedly storm a mercenary base yet they treat you like the a beginner.
-Varu'un DLC is pointless no matter which ending you choose, map is just uselessly large. 
-So many ""girl-bosses"" stereotype that every NPC in position that's female, is too haughty-arrogant, elitist, scheming, angry and prideful. 
-The ""men"", even if they are decorated or have a backstory of the toughest life, looks unconvincing. They look like salarymen/ average office worker. Not intimidating, only elitist behavior same with the girl boss archetype. 
-NPCs are ugly af, they're fat and weak looking. 
-Seriously, the Astral Lounge, that's the best Bethesda came up with? It's Neon, the dirty, hardcore city yet Astral Lounge looks like a gender studies students hangout place. The alien costume is silly af. One look at Cyberpunk 2077's clubs or bars, the difference is staggeringly obvious.

Explorations:
-Planets are still as empty
-Boring and repetitive
-Walking simulator
-REV is useless in a rocky planet (which most of them are), even a bush can stop it in the tracks

Combat:

What i like:

☆graphics are great (better then Fallout 76)
☆the missions, sidemissions, activities etc are great and A LOT. It's not like go here and do that or go here and steal that like Assasins Creed does.
☆factions are very nice to have
☆level design is great
☆gravity is different on a lot of planets.
☆ sound quality is superb
☆it looks like todays technology and looks believeble

What i don't like:

-I can not fly into the atmosphere of a planet (only cutscenes)

-It is not seamless in terms of transitions like No Man Sky. (Loading/cut screens)

-When doing a NG+ i lose all my inventory eventhough i put them in the ""captains locker"" the ship only upgrades in terms of stats why do i lose my stuff???

- the story is still incomplete in terms of ""starborn"" 

- when facing the endgame and everyone want to come with me when i have the artifacts etc why do i only see myself and not the rest of the crew who wants to ""gravdrive jump"" with me in the final sequence?

I invited everybody and only see myself, not cool.

-there is no way to play ""football"" on the moon with your companion. I would love to play some sort of minigame on certain locations. Or play catch with edmond the desktoy just for fun.

-when having a marriage how can you share a single small stretcher with your husband/wife. There should be an option wich says that its a tight fit and you are not well rested etc. If i spoon with my wife on a 1 person bed i'm not well rested unless i kick her out of the bed and she sleeps on the ground :-).

- if married and doing an NG+ I want to have a chance to see my wife and that is not available at the moment eventhough i grind the game numerous times.
 
There should be an option to jump both partners to the same universe and continue their marriage.

- when visiting temples i want to see Vaasco (companion) also entering it and be flying like ED209 of robocop and making sounds like i'm falling etc. Those little humour stuff isn't there 

- you can not see that you pilot the ship like your hands on a joystick/steeringwheel etc. I mean i get an Tesla/SpaceX autopilot feeling out of it.

- i want to have a ""minigame"" in it in which i dock my ship on the eye etc instead of a cutscene. I want to center align it and connect the clamps that connect me to the station. How can i be a captain if i can't do it myself? And Sarah compliments me on a safe landing but how? I only see a cutscene. I want to land my bird on the ground and not some spaceX autopilot.

Those little things are annoying. So Bethesda, if you read this, please implements those little things.

Stupid idea:

In the end you can hear your voice why not give us a karaoke machine on board of a spaceship or in the eye and make us sing with vladimir some pirate songs like you can do in the Yakuza games. That would be hilarious IMHO.

[b] My Two Cent Review [/b]
[i] Is it bad I had to force myself to play this game for more then 3 hours to actually get into it? Literally the first 3 hours was me playing an hour and getting bored and not touching the game again for a few days eventually forcing myself to pick it back up. After the 3 hour mark however I did start to find myself enjoying the game taking an interest in the companions and the factions which take up literally 80% of my gameplay time.  The storylines for the factions are decent (not great) but decent. My companions have there own personalities and all of them like to give you random crap almost after every outing you take them on which is something. The main story however is very boring to me and really didn't peak my interest and what interest I did have I lost after [spoiler] I gained dragonborn abilities half way through it. [/spoiler]  When I was getting bored with the game and had did everything besides the main story I begrudgingly finally did which took me on this A to B goose chase where I [spoiler] killed a bunch of teleporting douche bags that killed one of only few companions I actually liked only to find out that the evil factions main guy who killed my favorite companion was a f u c k i n g alternate universe version of my dead companion. [/spoiler] At that point I was checked out [spoiler] and killed everyone quickly and effortlessly and walked into my own alternate universe [/spoiler] and checked out of the game entirely after that. What could have been one of the best space RPG games out there was sadly rushed out before it was finished cooking.  You travel anywhere outside of the main cities in the game and what you'll find is a lot of different planets with some generic dog like creatures and some reused generic colony little habitat farmer outposts and maybe an abandon facility pirates took over. Some of the missions that you can play are bugged which if your like taking care of your side work like me will piss you off when you go and collect payments from a dead beat and because you didn't do it right away the guy just randomly dies and you can't collect from him because the loot didn't spawn on his body so your stuck with that quest in your mission board unless you do some command prompt bull s h i t which will disable your achievements by the way or install m o d s. By the way good luck beating this game without the use of at least some kind of mod because there are so many vanilla bugs you will trap yourself or break the game in some way where you will have to use patchwork mods to progress in this abandoned game the developers tossed aside when it didn't meet it's first quarterly projections. They made a DLC but they didn't listen to feed back and from what I hear it's worse then the base game so I ain't touching that trash. There is outpost building where you can build your own outpost and harvest resources on certain worlds but to be honest the only building that's worth building is in your own ship. There'll be a point where you'll make more credits then you'll ever spend. It's not a bad game but it lacks in major storytelling area's and world design for it be a proper hit. There new game + mechanic while interesting isn't enough to bring me back for round two. Let's not even get started on the hardware you need to run to keep this beast of a game from turning your computer into a toaster.  The lockpicking as well sucks I don't like it which isn't a surprise there really hasn't been a good lockpicking mechanic I have liked this one is just bizarre. Also the persuasion and charisma check mini-game they have you do sucks with you sometimes speaking none sense to persuade people. [/i]

[b] The Value Of The Game [/b]
[i] 70 dollars for this game is laughable at it's best it's worth 20 - 25 but nowhere near 70 dollars. It's got some good faction and side missions but this ain't a game you wanna play for the main story that's for sure. [/i]

What I mean by that is this, the game has its moments of humor, its quirks, its cool aspects and features, and a cool idea behind it.

I loved it and I hope they either remaster it sometime or they make a sequel.""

On release, I dropped an easy 94 hours into this game and figured it was...okay.

Like everyone else I was a fan of the new worlds and a hater of the repetition and loading screens, but it was still fun and solid. Until I became a starborn.
There was no consequences, why would I care if John Character dies if I can simply hop into the next universe and he's wide awake smiling like a pig in crap?
It got very, very boring after my first 'Unity' and a few minutes into the second when I realized the biggest reward you get from doing it multiple times is (no joke) another ribbon or pad on your tacky looking starborn suit? I bounced.

Flash forward to May 2025, after being off the game for actual eons, I found a fun video explaining how Starfield in 2025 is good! Hooray! full mod support, lots of updates, surely this will be better.

It was worse, I can't speak for everyone in possession of a NASA supercomputer that will probably vent Earth's atmosphere into space (ehh see what I did there?). But for me personally, the same rig that ran this game just fine on release and has received a few upgrades internally since then, BSOD'd upon trying to boot it vanilla. I finally got it running enough to mod it, thinking the QOL mods and good stuff the world has put into SF would be sufficient...It was not, my PC was brought to it's knees like it stole a chip in the Mojave desert and BSOD'd even more commonly.

I am aware this may be my problem and ""Muh nvidia 69420 poopfart card"" and all that, but there's no reason in my mind that the same game, on the same rig, should suddenly go to garbanzo beans over a few mods and ""updates""

Starfield,1716740,194041031,"[h1]I uninstalled Starfield twice—only to reinstall it and get completely pulled back in.[/h1]

Here’s how I think you can best enjoy the game:

[h1]1. Install StarUI.[/h1]
It’s a simple mod that improves the interface. Just drop the files in the right folder—done.

[h1]2. Treat it like a meditation.[/h1]
If you're after constant action, this isn't the game. But it’s perfect for when you want to fully engage with something. Too interesting to have a podcast or netflix in the back, too chill to get your addrenalin up like CoD / Warzone etc.

Id say: It’s chill, but immersive.

[h1]3. Stick to normal difficulty.[/h1]
The scaling is poor—harder settings just make enemies tanky and drawn-out. It’s single-player and story-focused, so crank it to normal and enjoy the ride.

[h1]4. Get into the story.[/h1]
Bethesda does narrative and world-building better than most. Even side quests and random notes can be surprisingly touching. A lot of small moments hit hard, even if they don’t show up as major quests. Generally, among the many dialouge options, it feels like there is a ""human"" option. Meaning that usually if you pay a bit of attention and just dont act rude most dialouge develop very logical and beneficial for you. The goal is to avoid shootouts and instead get everything for free. There will be plenty of opportunities to kill enemies.

[h1]5. Use fast travel.[/h1]
Yes, there are a lot of loading screens—but that’s true for every Bethesda game. Accept it, and the experience flows much better.

[h1]6. Build your ship, not your base.[/h1]
Base-building is deep but complicated. Early on, focus on upgrading your ship with storage and workbenches. Bases are mostly for farming and aesthetics and can be frustrating at the start.

Starfield has plenty of flaws, and much of the criticism is valid. But unlike No Man’s Sky or Elite Dangerous, this feels like a more grounded, adult sci-fi game. If you come for the story and the beautifully crafted universe, you’ll find something special. The graphics and design are excellent—and the fact that this whole world exists just for you on your PC makes it feel oddly personal.",True,179,5402

Starfield,1716740,194018303,"Just my character his wife and their robot friend exploring the universe while doing science and defense contract work. Starfield is a good game overall with some rough edges that need polish but it’s a solid new entry point that I hope to see expanded on.

The overall theme of the game is exploration and I believe they did a good job keeping to that for the most part. There are a ton of hidden quests and random events that occur, some of which gleam a murky light on the world and lore of Starfield. It’s where the real grit of the journey can be found. There are occasional hard science, physics, and philosophical intrigue throughout the game to appease those nerdy interests, myself included here.

The storyline (no spoilers) sets up nicely for each new play-through being entirely different which is pretty cool overall.

I highly recommend the shattered space DLC as it adds a traditional planet map to explore on foot, the companions have some fairly extensive conversational stuff to chime in on, and the story arc is interesting and left me wondering where it was going. Plus I didn’t spot a single repeat voice actor which helps with the immersion.

The mod community has added a plethora of cool mods to help tweak your gameplay. I paired the built in combat difficulty sliders with dynamic universe for level scaling. As I grew in firearms power I adjusted the settings over time while including the advanced settings for the injury and survival systems. By level 100, I had player damage set to very easy with enemy damage set to very hard.. this translated to about 3-4 shots to kill an enemy with a pistol or 1-2 shots with a sniper rifle with melee enemies capable of killing me in 1-3 hits or 3-6 hits with ranged. Say goodbye to bullet sponge! Additionally bringing a companion + cover was necessary to help with large groups of foes.

Couple of recommended/critical mods:
-Starfield Community Patch
-Anything from mod creator: ZoNE79
-Desolation
-Forgotten Frontiers
-Dark Universe: Takeover
-Dungeon Randomized
-Autoswap suit/helmet
-Dynamic Universe
-Royal Weather (lite)
-Realistic Ragdoll and Force + Corpse Collision


If you are like me and set environmental hazards to advanced difficulty, I recommend Shade’s Vehicle Tuner. There is an option to allow your vehicle to refill your suits environmental protection.. this is essential for mobile exploration of some planets.

A couple criticisms/needs some revision:

1- Occasionally there is zero immersive animations. The npc might say “let me check my computer” or “let me transfer payment” they just stare at you. No moving around the office to type up something on their computer, nor pulling out a data pad, nor looking busy at all. This really stands out in this day and age especially in comparison to other big studio single player games.

2- Ship customization needs a feature to tell you where doors are located on the habs and you need an option to prevent ladders from spawning. Nobody wants a maze for the interior of their ship. I lost a good 20+ hours trying to figure out this mechanic as some of the placements seem entirely random.

3- Whoever thought of the resource micro management “game” for outposts should be sacked like straight out of a monty python skit. It’s cumbersome, time consuming and poorly optimized at best. Resource generators are on a timer that exports resources to storage that is always too small. THEN you have to move them to your desired outpost and if it is out of the galaxy, GOOD LUCK balancing fuel demand. I don’t want to play some resource management sim. If I did, I’d go play one that is specifically designed around that. I just want a base where I can craft my team’s gear, ship parts, pick up missions, consumables, and research. This whole thing could have been simplified down to something like this: Project A requires Iron, does any of your collective outposts have access to Iron? Yes, cool and done. Project B requires 4 different resources, do you have access to those resources? No, okay get to exploring and build some mines/harvesters. It should be like an umbrella. It’s find to connect links but I shouldn’t have to spend hours of real life trying to move resources planet to planet. Of all the things to hand wave in the scheme of playability, this should have been one of them.

4- This is minor but mentionable; all the outpost habs are empty.. so you have to spend time setting them up. I wish they came furnished (like ships) or partially furnished to fill out on your own to save time.


All in all, I dig Bethesdas newest IP. It’s got some familiar along with some new. The mission statement was something like 10 years of support and growth for the game. This guy is curious to see where that goes and what that means to them but I’m fairly sure I won’t be disappointed.",True,1,22713
Starfield,1716740,194008468,"This game is fun. Beware if you buy this though, if you expect a wild roller-coaster of a game, this is not the game for you. You will find yourself lost in a vast universe, wandering, taking sights, or doing a very menial task you prefer over the main quest.

If you ignore what is not trying to do, the game does has its flaws. Nothing that would not be fixed by mods. Really it would be just great to have steam mods. I wonder why there are no steam mods. It is almost as if they did not want steam mods so they could have the Creation Club. Surely not, that would be like adding a bug by design. Look--I understand the strategy, I am a ruthless capitalist too, but maybe I'd do the shameless cash crab on a well loved franchise when the players are ripe for harvest then wait for them to be ready again. Or maybe I'd tolerate steam mods because I'd be offering a good service or maybe I'd also do the strategy of 'You want to go somewhere else? Be my guest, I just demolished where my competitors used to live in.' Is it still a good review despite the lack of steam mods? Yes it is, because the game is still fun without them. I will rant about it because it makes a good game objectively worse. The game has tons of mechanics and free space, ready for modders to latch on. It could have taken the smart route and make modding a part of that game mechanics but instead chose to make it a part of its monetization. It did that while being utterly oblivious of its potential, instead choosing to slap an old formula that did not take well on the other games, expecting that it would work here. It's just pitiful--seeing the devs pump out Creations to keep the service alive--because you know fully well that if the modders come flocking in, they will be the next ones to be harvested like cattle because that's what every other service does these days. First you give something good to get users, then you invite other to milk the users with you at the cost of service quality, and then you milk everyone because the whole point was total domination from the very beginning. It used to be subtle but not anymore. Not when people realized they could own both the cash cow that is rapidly becoming fine compost and the shiny new thing that will cannibalize it, and evidently cares about its users, and is definitively not attempting the very same scheme. Maybe I'm just lazy and I should go to that mod website that provides a great service for its users at the low cost of creating an account. That's actually a valid point but then, why do they--Bethesda--remove the achievements? why do they even remove steam workshop to begin with? why do they make actual efforts to make things worse so they can sell a solution? Maybe I'm just wrong and not only Creation Club is bringing tons of money to the devs but it also brings people together in a way free communities would never be able to. Maybe Bethesda ought to fully own its IP and profit from all its derivative works, fan works, commentaries, heck even this review, neigh the whole internet and its computer too now that it's owned by Microsoft. Own everything, monetize everything. No more competitors. Sell a Creation Club game in a western setting, call it Oatfield or whatever, no game, just paid mods, people will still buy it because that's marginally better than nothing. Maybe I just fail to recognize a bad game and this has nothing to do with Creation Club. Surely, the design flaw of Starfield lays elsewhere but I'd never know because I'm not a game designer. The universe just ought to be owned by Bethesda, but it only works if it's a western, or it has dragons or whatever.

Having finished the main story and some of the most prominent side quests, I can definitely say I'm in love with this game and would recommend it to anyone looking for an immersive sci-fi story-based experience. Starfield was made by people enamored with space exploration and it shows. It has just about everything, from amazing world building and thoughtful dialogue to really smooth and satisfying battle gameplay, whether you're up in space or down on the ground. Character writing and acting are wonderful, whether it's the main cast or literally just some minor NPCs that you only meet once. There's also always plenty of stuff to do, from elaborate ship building or perfecting your space suits and weapons to pure exploration and base building (which can be both practical and cosmetic). It can feel overwhelming at first, but that's also one of the best parts - the world feels vast and full of wonders and perils waiting to be discovered. You aren't forced onto one single linear path, instead you're free to explore and set your own goals as you go. 

I would definitely recommend Starfield to anyone who already played previous Bethesda games because they took what already worked and improved upon it with great care and detail. And if you haven't played any of them, it'll make an amazing first experience. It gets criticized for being a ""typical Bethesda title"" but personally, I love their games and their approach to single player experiences. 

Another thing to add is that it's a completely different game now compared to what it was like when it first launched. I definitely recommend checking everything that's been updated and added since then! On top of that, their Creations (Mods) tab is packed with some really great stuff and plenty of free mods to try. 

With about 129 hours played at the time of writing this, I've only done one single playthrough - and that was mostly just the main story and some side stuff.

However, there aren't enough factions, the factions that do exist don't have enough written content and rely too much on radiant quests, the new game + feature cheapens the decisions you make along the way, and there aren't enough important decisions to make in the first place. The game also shoe-horns you into a good play-through; all companions are good leaning at minimum, and there's only one quest line that allows you to really stray from the good path. 

It lacks that quality that FONV, FO4, and Skyrim all had, where it felt like there was a specific path to fit the character you created, factions that existed that aligned with your character's value's, and factions you don't join, decisions you don't make because they don't make sense for your character. The various options feel like vague, easy choices that you would make again each and every play-through, with the occasional difference.

It makes it boring whether you agree or disagree with this political viewpoint ; once you know what the developers believe ideologically, you can predict everything else in the game - which causes continual eye rolls on the part of the player and smells of heavy corporate oversight on a creative process. 

That oversight resulted in artists playing it safe and telling ""the stories you are supposed to tell"" as opposed to ""the stories people didn't know they needed to hear"".

Starfield,1716740,193715094,"Amazing game IMHO, with over 1500 hours in.  I've only CTD'd a couple times early on.  Its a very stable game on my middle-of-the-road game system (RTX 3080 and 12th gen processor).  The story line(s) are excellent, do captivate you along the way, and are fulfilling when you complete them.  You don;t have to do just the main quest line, just like other Bethesda games.  I haven't been to every system yet, not even close over those hours.  And yeah, I finished the first NG line a few times, and even done it in NG+.  People say the worlds are boring.  If you play vanilla, with no mods, it can be challenging on the high level worlds.  The truth is there are tons of randomly spawned sites and features no matter where you land on a planet, to the point that it seems like its too much for a ""barren"" world.  Land, look around and at least 5 different ""sites"" are showing up 360 degrees around the horizon that can be visited.  Everywhere.  Many comment negatively about that as well, ironically in direct opposition to the ones that say its ""boring"".  So what that should tell you is that this game is what it is and perhaps like all games, is not meant for EVERYONE's taste.

Further, although the actual sites themselves are repetitive after a while, they are challenging and afford you the chance to hone different approaches as you try them from time to time.  They don't repeat too often and I think I read that there are something like 100 different types.  Each one can take an hour to get through if you are meticulous and a looter.  Shorter once they get familiar and you know where to look.  The NG+ is an interesting effect like the Witcher III repeat but without all the goodies you collected except the Starborn skills.  I like it, and it provides a different repeat play-ability feel than other games because some things can change dramatically in the ""new"" universe you pop into.  Critics will say its repeat hash.  To some degree but with the random changes possible, the original fun content stays alive for me on the repeat.

But the absolute gem in this game is the shipbuilding.  Making a ship interior you love and almost feel like you can live aboard is a masterpiece.  The one thing I love is just being able to hang out in your new space-faring RV and relax, do things inside, whatever.  In space or on a planet.  Craft, or make food.  Chat with the crew.  I sometimes just land on a planet and watch the local fauna wandering outside the window, with the sun setting or a winter storm gale just outside, safe and warm in my ship.  It is 95% of what space legs always meant to me (other game, eh hemm).  I've spent many, many hours building and modifying my ship just the way I like it.  As more 3rd party and mod parts arrive, the sky remains the limit in this aspect.  Just look online and see the amazing varieties (and funny) ships people have built.  I would have paid some of the cash for the game just for this feature alone.

So bottom line, don't take every thing negative you read as gospel.  Valid for those folks, to be sure.  However, the game is meant for a specific game style.  Its not a game designed to ""beat"" or replace some other game(s).  And its not Skyrim in space (as I have read).  Todd said it clearly multiple times.  Its a unique experience.

There's a ton of quests, and while some of them are basic fetch or kill quests, just wandering around and talking to people will net you more interesting ones.  While not every mission has a handcrafted environment, the main questlines for each faction do.

Overall, I'd say this is an iteration more than an innovation.  But if you enjoyed playing Skyrim and Fallout, you'll probably have fun playing this too.

-edit-

Ok, I've logged more than 100 more hours since my initial review, and I didn't give this game enough credit.  On a New Game+ playthrough, I'm finding TONS of quests that I didn't find on my first playthrough.  All four of the main faction quests are interesting and unique, and highlight different modes of gameplay.  But there are also an incredible number of other quests you'll find just by traveling around the galaxy, and a lot of them are weird and wonderful.

I'd also like to shout out the voice acting.  While it's sometimes noticeable that an actor voiced multiple roles among the minor NPCs, the main Constellation companions are all excellently written and voiced.

Cities feel like a movie set, with huge buildings that have zero function except to be a single storefront at street level. The Cities end up feeling empty and WAY too small. I get that this is a Bethesda game so i should expect cities to be about 10 houses MAX, but both oblivion and skyrim did the best they could with what they had and made their small little towns and cities feel somewhat alive. They (obl and sky) gave npcs schedules to follow and overhearing conversations could start a new quest, or give a hint as to where to go to get one. Fallout 4 had the too small city problem as well, but with it being a post apocalyptic game, with most of the world dead, I can't really blame them for that one. This game is set in the far future, with the technology to match. The only city that felt like it was actually kind of big was Neon, but I think that can partially be attributed to its density. New Atlantis, the CAPITAL of a interstellar Faction, looks tiny. It has what, 3 or so skyscrapers, the main spire and a few smaller buildings? Are we foreal right now? 

Akila City seems like it should get a pass, based on how it feels kinda of like a wild wild west style vibe, so its city and small and (frontier-like) to match, but then you realize its supposed to be the CAPITAL of the second largest interstellar faction in the game.... A town smaller than Solitude in Skyrim governs... multiple planets? OH and you might be thinking, ""but hey wasn't it founded a few years ago? NOPE, it was founded ONE HUNDRED and SIXTY THREE YEARS AGO. Are you kidding me right now? Stuff like this pisses me off when a game is supposed to be set in the far space-faring future. 160+ years is nothing if you are in the bronze age, but this is an era with spaceships. 163 years later the entire planet should be basically one city. 

The weapons and gun-play are passable, they work as they should for the most part. I will say, the way they implemented weapon variety and randomization gets super annoying. I will have 5 of the same weapon in my inventory, but because a weapon can (NOT CLEARLY) change its stats and effects based on what perks, attachments, and effects a weapon has, I have to spend 5-10 minutes figuring out which of the 5 weapons is the best, or at least the most compatible with my particular play style. I think this system could have been simplified dramatically, or reworked to be MUCH clearer. 

Do not get me started on stealth. This game might have the worst stealth in any Bethesda game to date. I am a dedicated stealth player. My first character in every Bethesda game is a stealth character. I LOVE stealth. The stealth in this game SUCKS. It feels like an afterthought where they made the game and then went, ""Oh woopsie! Some people like being stealthy, we better slap that on quick!"" Even the missions where you are supposed to be stealthy are designed so poorly that It ends up just becoming frustrating and are some of my least favorite missions in the entire game. 

Enemy Scaling is wild and I have literally no idea from one encounter to the next whether the enemies I am about to fight will be able to be killed with a tickle and a feather or if I am about to get into a 1v10 cage match with the most ridiculously broken Steroid enhanced terminator Pirates you have ever seen. 

The Spaceship combat: 
This was not a major pain point for me. I didn't get this game with the expectation that I was going to be flying in space for more than just getting to place to place. Could it be much better? Absolutely. Was it fine and does the job for what Bethesda is becoming known for....  A relatively shallow, one size fits all, approachable, dumbed-down rpg experience that has bits and pieces of greatness? Yes. 

The writing- 
I am writing this review AFTER Oblivion Remastered came out, specifically because it came out and I remembered what Bethesda was like when they REALLY cared about well written and entertaining stories that had depth. The writing in Starfield is just.... meh. Nothing really stood out to me as a WOW moment when it came to any of the main, faction, or side quests story lines. I do not remember them being necessarily bad, but I also do not remember much of them, so take that as you will. 

The Universe-
I think Bethesda, as one of the kings of environmental storytelling, should have stuck to a game that was set in either one single larger solar system, or stuck to a few solar systems at most. This game is just too big and too empty. Bethesda making it was just kind of a weird choice. Using procedural generation was an absolute mistake. One of the most annoying things was landing on a planet in one solar system, and then going to a different planet in a different solar system, and those two planets look nearly the same, with similar foliage, animals, enemies, and locations. Don't get me started on how many times I saw the EXACT same space or pirate base layout on a randomly generated planet. Down to the exact same notes on the computer. If they wanted to make a huge randomly generated space game, they needed a MUCH larger bank of Pre-made elements for that system to pull from.

Planets- 
The random planets are also just way too empty to be interesting. Whats worse is, even the ""handcrafted"" planets that housed a capital or a relevant unique quest destination, did not even feel good. It looked like the planet was randomly generated, but then the quest location was just plopped down in the middle. 

Factions are bland and relatively uninteresting, with somewhat boring and too-quick quests that feel unrewarding. Too much busywork and not enough handcrafted content. 

This game COULD have been so good. I sincerely hope we see a return to Oblivion's care and concern for the depth of storytelling and RPG mechanics. IT IS OKAY if you are able to (somewhat) lock yourself into a play style (like oblivion did) for one run of a game. You don't NEED to keep everything so simple and accessible just so that anyone can do everything. Bethesda used to be one of the greats. Now I cant even recommend Todd Howard's Gem. The game he said he always wanted to make. Its too shallow. I hesitate to use the word ""slop"" but I am getting close. It sometimes feels like every new game they make, they make it easier and simpler, just to make sure that the widest audience possible can play it. Please Bethesda, Look at the reception Oblivion Remastered is getting. That isn't just because it might be the best looking game on the market right now. (It is.) It is because Oblivion came from a time when Bethesda CARED.

This review is unfortunately overall going to come across very negative. I don't want you to think I am hating for fun. I simply have seen Bethesda at its Best, (Morrowind, Oblivion), at its Great,(Fallout 4, Skyrim), and now I am seeing Bethesda at their worst. (Fallout 76, Starfield. The incessant paid creation mods)

I am simply a fan of a game studio. I want them to make ""Game of the Year"" games again.

Best I can say, is the game is mid, uninspired, lacking any reason to play more than 10 NG+. 

It does most things well: Gun-play, ship combat, Jump packs, back-story, traits, perk progression, research, powers, planets, sky boxes, lighting details, day/night cycles, environmental hazards, mining, and scanning are all good features that add depth to how you can play. the core of the game is good, in my opinion, all the things that matter on the surface, ""just work"".  

What does not ""Just work"" is everything that makes it a game instead of a solid tech-demo: 
- Weapon quality tiers (quality tiers tie to player level but do not always drop at that quality. getting god roll legendaries on a lower quality is absolute pain and ""Slow [in french]"")
- The Temples... they're slightly worse than Farcry's radio towers.
- The shallowness of dialogue and story telling. It does not feel good after 6 NG+, it becomes a chore...
- The Setting you play in is the boring aftermath to the War that should have been when the game actually takes place.
- There's no lock out of anything, you can help nearly every main faction in one play-through. They all accomplish nothing but pad your bank account for the rest of the run... nothing outside the quest changes, no actual affect is had on the world. Even though its brought up numerous times in the NG+ like our choices in the next game will matter.
- Loading screens... so... many... un-hidden... in-your-face... anti-immersive... spinning wheels (with the occasional gallery image). Literally just cutting the Grav jump burst animation and replacing it with a grav jump ""wormhole"" animation, viewed from the cockpit of your ship, that persists till you load the next area would hide 60% of the loading wheels and will make the rest of them, tolerable. 
- The Game puts you on the surface of a planet, outside your ship, when you use the star-map to travel to a settlement, city, or PoI on a planet you've already visited. (STOP PUTTING ME ON THE SURFACE OF MARS WITHOUT A SUIT).
- Lack of polish (One example is how people still teleport when entering and exiting doors, but now elevators don't even close to try and hide it like the devs did in Fo4).

Overall... Starfield is a solid tech demo, they put a lot of time and money into improving the core of the creation engine, only to cover it in a rotting husk of a ""game"".",True,0,923

Dialogue is boring and characters are bland. Combat and gun-play is average. Ship building is alright but most ship parts require a pretty heavy time investment to unlock. I'd rather spend my time playing something less bland.

Don't listen to Todd Howard's BS, this is an extremely poorly optimized game.

Starfield,1716740,193609383,"Like Fallout 4 (pre-DLC), Starfield is a game that has a gimmick that kept me playing for a bit, but beyond that gimmick, the game feels rushed, incomplete and empty. For FO4, the gimmick was settlement building. For Starfield, it's ship building and customization. That part of the game is enjoyable, but the rest is rather dull and not particularly memorable. Empty planets, the same exact process to get each Jedi power, a needlessly-punishing encumbrance limit (unless you can cast the oxygen spell, which fully negates all encumbrance), zero consequence for your actions, and unbelieveably BORING companions. NPCs don't react to anything you do, including shooting the ground at their feet. The Gamebryo engine was outdated when Skyrim launched, and it hasn't much improved since. It feels like Todd is just clocking in and out of the office, counting the days until retirement, too disinterested in the games he's responsible for. I'm convinced the whole reason Bethesda stubbornly refuses to abandon Creation Engine *cough Gamebryo cough*, is because that's the engine Todd acquired his fame on, he understands it inside and out, and is vehemently opposed to having to learn something new, this close to retiring. That's why we're stuck with innumerable loading screens every time we want to do something that isn't run or shoot. He doesn't care that the more advanced their games get, the more held back they are by that obsolete engine.

People complain about the graphical quality, but it's fine. Hardly cutting edge, but nowhere near bad. The aesthetic designs are unremarkable at best, and dull as a math lecture at worst. But the graphical 'quality' is fine. There's zero space exploration in this space game. The engine simply wouldn't support it. The writing is comically bad. Bethesda's writing never recovered from the departure of Michael Kirkbride. The OST sets the mood, but you probably don't remember any of the music if you haven't played for a while. In fact, I can't even recall the theme music off the top of my head. The whole experience is about as remarkable as vanilla ice cream. And I don't mean the fancy kind with the vanilla bean shavings and those little black dots that add flavor; I mean the kind you get in the frozen foods section of Walmart, because your kids won't stop begging you for ice cream, but you can't afford the kind that comes with flavor, because you spent $100 on the Premium Edition of Starfield, and now feel you have little to show for it.

Again, I enjoyed the ship building and customization. Being able to design a ship from scratch and decorate it how you want is pretty awesome, and it kept me engaged far longer than anything else in the game. The UC Vanguard faction questline was pretty good, I admit. A few of the other quests had a strong start, but none of theme really ended up finishing strong.

I tried their version of New Game+ with an existing character, but that just made me feel like my character no longer belonged and the people he met weren't really his friends. My approach quickly devolved to getting all my powers upgraded, skipping all quests and content not necessary to speedrunning the ending and going to the next universe to do it all again. I burnt out around my sixth universe jump. It was a poor implementation of NG+, and it would've been better if you could just traditionally start a new game with an existing character without trying to tie it into the lore. If that confuses you, it's because you probably have never seen NG+ implemented in this way, before.

I didn't play Shattered Space, so I can't comment on that, but the reviews are not looking good.

I think most people don't really care if Starfield comes out with additional dlc at this point, but as Bethesda hasn't announced yet that they are abandoning the game, I suspect we'll get at least once more. If they can pull off a Far Harbor, that would be great, but I'm not optimistic. They could potentially release compelling dlc content, but the base game design (what people keep calling the ""bones of the game"") is outdated and I doubt this will ever fully recover. Many long-time modders of Bethesda titles aren't even touching this one, because they can't figure out how to make it worth playing, long-term.

As my play time and achievements will attest, I gave this one a solid chance and it's not completely without merit, though it is quite mediocre and not a game I would recommend at full price. If you're not going the Game Pass route, I really wouldn't recommend this game unless it goes on sale for around $35. You'll get your money's worth at $35.",False,1,9909

And the game does not evoke any sense of wonder or excitement in me, like the following games did: Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Prey, The Evil Within, Dishonored... I think the game suffers because of the lack of vision and purposeful scope. There are many random moons to loot on, but they don't feel different from one another and it would have been more interesting to have less of those, and more effort into fleshing out planets with interesting side quests and areas. It was trying to balance realism (which is mundane) with fantastical (which seemed out of place).

When I played it, I had a lot of fun and consistently looked forward to picking it up again after taking a break. The story is solid, and the section where the Hunter is chasing you stands out as particularly engaging and tense.

I will admit the beginning felt like a bit of a stretch—it’s hard to buy into the idea of being ""chosen"" after touching an artifact and suddenly having a vision. In a game set so far into the future, where advanced medical technology is everywhere, it seems like the logical response would be a quick head scan and maybe some rest—not a prophecy. This kind of trope works better in fantasy or medieval settings, but felt slightly off here.

That said, the gameplay itself is fun and satisfying. Yes, other games offer more immersive or manual planet landing and takeoff mechanics, but it honestly didn’t bother me much. I ended up using fast travel most of the time anyway, and it worked well within the flow of the game.

Compared to other Bethesda titles, Starfield seems like it has less to do in terms of factions or sheer content density. But what is there is high quality, and I enjoyed everything I found. The characters are well written and engaging. The soundtrack, while not as iconic as Skyrim or TES, is subtle and fits the tone of the game very well—perhaps that’s the mark of a good soundtrack after all.

My overall mark is 6/10. The game is worth to buy when on the discount. Hardly it will give you more than 100 hours of gameplay unless you are ""finish all side quest"" guy. The game will offer you mechanics that you will both hate and love.
Lets dive deep into what I experienced during my 90 hours of playing:

The game provides 5 core game mechanics with my score for each:
World divercity 6/10
Quests 4/10
Space Ship management and space battles 7/10
Outpost management 6/10
Exploration 6/10


Before I start, i need to mention that I used couple of mods from Creations that altered my game experience:
- removed annoying conditions to all talens
- installed better outpost management mods (in the late game) that gave me rich trade authority terminals
- inventory size booster mod
- easy digipix 
I dont think that these mods impacted a lot on my gameplay, but made game more pleasant, less time consuming and less grindy. By the way mod system is a good thing in the game, that can remove/alter the most hated aspects of the game. 

So lets begin with entire world divercity 6/10.
The universe is still compact consisting of 120 star systems, while you will jump across 5-7 core systems all the time.
No aliens at all. This is the most dissapointing thing in the game. In the 120 systems there is no smart aliens except humans. This makes a spacegame poor in imagination and dreams. Planets are poorly visualized and looks like a big pixel from the orbit. (I know my laptop is not great, but other games could impress more even on my old kettle)
Usually, habitated planets will have only one core city and wildereness right outside city border. Seems ridiculous for me, since humans prefer to settle across the planet, build roads, villages, strip clubs... You can land in any point on the planet and it will generate you a random map covered with the same building types as in any other planet/rock/asteroid/outpost/whatever deep hole you can land in. Battles are usually boring in the game, although loot system is quite diverce. I need to mention that the game offers a lot of mechanics, that could be interesting to you but I cant list them all here (piracy as an example). Characters, heroes, teammates were boring to me and unimpressive. Loading screens everywhere is a real failure for Betheda. Luckily there are some mods that make game seamless. 

Quests 4/10
My overall opinion is that they are repeatedly boring. Maybe i couldnt fall in love with the the whole world and story idea, so I skipped many side quests. They looks the same, played the same and provides little interesting rewards.
Main quest story in my opinion is a complete bullsh*t. When playing space game you will less expect multiverse topic picked as the main idea. It was already consumed to zero by Marvel...
I would anticipate more alien contacts, rich history of each planet, complicated life on each planet. Perhaps Mass Effect is a standard/reference for these game type. Quests to find temples are the most stupid thing to me. How noone else had discovered these temples before main hero is a mystery. Overall temples, magical abilities are both idiotic game aspects that was stolen from Skyrim and looks really ridiculous and useless in the game.

Spaceships and spacebattles 7/10
Spaceships management is a tool where i really spent a lot of time and enjoyed it. It still has some problems, although it is something that really impressed me. Spacebattles are less interesting aspect since you will majorly face 2-3 enemy ships without any continuation of the battle in the location. I loved spending time with boarding and stealing enemy ships. Unfortunately the game offers little difference between ships and classes, but it was fun to me.

Outpost management 6/10
This game aspect was very fun at the beginning and very annoying in the late-game. Once you know how to extract first extractors you will be amazed how useless this process is. Still I spent a lot of time on this, and played SIMs like outpost management. Connection between outposts is a broken thing, although an idea with landing pads and shipments was great. I also bored to hell trying to find a perfect spot for my other outposts. The biggest problem here is that you are building outposts to gather resources for other outpost. Thats it. You will use resources for science and upgrades, whether it is much easier to buy these resources rather that mine in outposts. Some micromanagement of storages, connections, fabrication seemed inefficient to me.

Exploration 6/10
Again 120 systems... And almost nothing to do. Planets could have plants and animals which will live only in a specific biotope. I do inderstand the limitation of current game technologies, but I prefer to see rich, spectacular sightseens of alien planets made by a game designer rather than boring and automatically generated maps. Perhaps it is my prefference. The most annoying for me was riding a car and kick counless boulders and rocks each meter. You cant ride straight on any planet really. Nevertheless someone could find this technology of map and world generation interesting and promising. Scanning of planets is a strange thing. On the one hand why the hell I need to scan the planet with human colony. Should it be scanned by explorers in the past? Then you just scan to reveal resources without any other real purpose. Even with a proper talent ""astrophysics"" you need to scan each planet manually. Luckily it gives you some free exp in exchange of being bored.

In the conclusion. The game will definetely attract you for some time. It has very interesting mechanics , but once you will consume all interesting things you may find yourself immediately bored. Nevertheless I think it was worth of playing 90 hours.",True,0,5437

I'm really sorry to have to give this a bad review. I've played it a lot looking for that Bethesda magic, hoping that it would appear on the next planet or in the next quest. But it's just not there. All the comments about the lack of exploration, the sterility of worlds, the blandness of quests, the poor loot variety are all true, but where Bethesda really failed here was with the story. When I solved the mystery, I was profoundly underwhelmed. The takeaway is that nothing matters. Nothing you did matters; no good you did matters; no evil you did matters. And yet somehow the game has to explain the motivations of the antagonists. Why do they pursue you when nothing matters? And the best Bethesda came up with is that they want power. Of course, that was the only explanation Bethesda could pick when it embraced a philosophy that denies that ""every action and every pursuit aims at some good."" But in Bethesda's telling, power has no use, no purpose, no ends. It aims at nothing at all. Perhaps some tiny number of empty people want power for no purpose at all, but they are not typical and they are not relatable. Yet Bethesda has built a game on the false premise that if any of us found ourselves in a world where nothing at all mattered, we would happily pursue power and resources for no other reason than to merely possess them. It isn't a compelling vision for a human life, so it can't be a compelling vision for a game.",False,4,18911

In Skyrim/Fallout, I wanted to explore all of the map and see everything out there, I had to come to the realization in Starfield, there isn't much out there, a few reused areas but very few things felt crafted for that specific area.

One thing I do like is the FPS controls, and going back to Fallout 4 and not trying to use VATS and just play like a FPS was terrible compared to this.

So if you can think of it as a FPS with very light RPG elements like dialog choices and customizations then you can enjoy this much more.

Starfield,1716740,193300500,"Now it is time... I was really hyped by Starfield and thought it could be one of my favorite games of all time.

I even waited until now (April 2025) to write this because I thought Bethesda could change things around or modders could fix the game, but it was not the case. Instead, they (Bethesda) abandoned the game that I could only describe as a ""shell for something that could be good"".

The only flaw of this game is really its game design - and don't take this lightly, because game design is the foundation of all games. With a poor game design, everything else crumbles under its weight. Pretty much EVERY system of the game do not realize its full potential.

Core combat -> OK, as flawed as previous titles and not the real enemy here
Ship Building -> Arguably the only good system in the game
Ship combat -> Extremely raw and shallow, makes very little sense to invest on it
Progression -> Also very shallow, many things useless, don't make sense to specialize into anything or create a character
Story (and its loop) -> Interesting but really poor executed - railroads you with such a force that if you try to roleplay you will just eventually be pulled to the vanilla character they created, which brakes everything turning you into a miner that becomes an inter dimensional entity.
Planetary Environments -> Landing on Venus and on an asteroid almost feels the same (only different gravities). No sense of danger)
Planetary Content -> Not challenging, level scaled mess that basically says ""if you land on this planet, ANYTHING will either kill you or be killed by a single bullet"". A complete mess, I don't remember Skyrim being so scaled (by FO was, I really hated it).
Settlement Building -> Probably the most under developed system in the game. FO4 had it better a decade ago, WHY????
Economy -> Not existent
Lore Acuity -> Settlements are worse than abandoned bandit bases on the middle of nothing
Content -> Plentiful but shallow

That being said, Bethesda has only one option -> fire all of its PRODUCT management involved on this project because they actually requested and approved this grandiose, uninspired mess that is Starfield. I cannot blame who executed it because the makeup (visuals, overall art direction, tailor made content, etc) is actually fine.

One can join all these different factions, but there is no recognition or continuity of the ""achievements"" after completing faction quests. Very lack luster story. It would've been interesting to be a part of the war instead of the peaceful era with a hint of tension among factions in the game's timeline takes place in. Npcs and companions feel lackluster and uninteresting. Shipbuilding is alright at best; the module system, while cool, is limited to the lack of variety the base game offers (There are some mods, but the difference isn't crazy. You won't be able to build exact replicas of star war ships, interior wise). Introducing premium pay for mods for a mediocre game is crazy work. It just goes to show how detached Bethesda has become or the desperation they have to try to milk the game in whatever shape or form they can since it flopped hard. Now, modding is practically dead for Starfield.
I really tried to come back to this game to play a modded playthrough, but barely any mods, and the game is a pain to mod for no reason compared to older Bethesda titles. I looked forward to this game when it was announced, but it feels empty, especially now. An RPG with no replayability. The looping system was the worst idea, it honestly felt like the writers chose the easiest route, ""Oh, let's just make players reset everything and go through some missions to get to the end rather quickly and give a cosmetic reward based on how many times they've done the loop."" Like, you are not forced to do it, but you kinda have to since as a player you want to see where it would lead to. The loop can offer a variety of little quirky changes here and there (Very minor changes. Small wow factor at best). Insane. Really disappointed. I really do hope we get a sci-fi rpg game with the same scope that Starfield attempted, but done right. I really can't recommend the game. Modders gave up on the game.

Starfield had the potential to be a revolutionary space RPG, but instead, it’s a buggy mess that feels like a glitchy space station. Sure, the concept is cool—exploring galaxies, customizing ships, and getting lost in a massive universe—but the execution is ruined by constant bugs. From awkward character animations to missions that don’t trigger properly, it’s like you’re playing a beta, not a finished product.

The bugs don’t just mess with immersion—they ruin gameplay. Getting stuck in the environment, crashing ships for no reason, or having quests break halfway through? It’s more frustration than fun. All the promises of deep space exploration are overshadowed by technical issues that make you want to quit rather than keep playing.

Starfield is ambitious. Bethesda set out to create a vast universe — literally — and in many ways, they succeeded. The scale is impressive, the ship customization is satisfying, and there are moments where the exploration genuinely captures a sense of awe. The faction quests (especially the UC Vanguard and Freestar Rangers) are some of the strongest the studio has ever done.

But then... the seams show.

The loading screens are frequent and immersion-breaking. Planets, while numerous, often feel empty and procedurally bland. Space travel is more of a menu system than an actual experience. The main story has interesting themes, but it takes a while to get going, and the dialogue is classic Bethesda: serviceable, but rarely memorable.

I think this game is the perfect ""mediocre"" of what Bethesda Games have become. When comparing it to ""newer"" Bethesda Games, it's somewhere in the middle of Fallout 4 and Skyrim in terms of story and how I feel about it. As for gameplay system, it's closer to Fallout 4 if they fumble massively.

Some of the side quest storylines are big headscratchers that will make you go ""Wait, that's it?""

But, the saving grace for all of it, at least for me is the ship building. Every kid who has ever dreamed of going to space (and/or autism) will probably like it. Also hits that sweet spot for me, the ability to make a mobile base for you and your crew.

The story, phiolosophy, narrative theme and design behind the New Game Plus is also one of the best i've seen, and the most satisfying. I really did feel something.

As for criticism, the game DOES feel a bit ""lifeless"", but i feel that in most Bethesda games. Oh and the loading screens. They're not game breakingly annoying by any means for me and didn't detach me from the game but come on this isn't 2005. If they'd just make something like the elevator in Cyberpunk, it'd have been much more immersive.

Starfield,1716740,192925528,"First Impressions

I almost fell for the negative comments surrounding this game, and I'm so glad I didn’t! As a massive alien fan and its retro-futuristic style, this game is aesthetically a dream come true. The fact that the game is more science than fiction is also a massive pro for me, because it makes it even more believable as a future vision of humans in space.
Just to say in advance, I'm not a huge Bethesda games fan — not that I think they're bad, it’s just that I always preferred hack and slash gameplay from games such as Witcher. So I'm not someone with thousands or even hundreds of hours in Skyrim or Fallout. I'm well acquainted with those games, but I won't even compare them to Starfield because you will get it by the end of my review.

Why I Like Starfield

Starfield gives me the freedom to do what I want in the moment. It’s not just some big map with thousands of question marks that I need to check out. I can go and do missions, extract resources, build ships, upgrade weapons or space suits, etc...
My goal that everything revolves around is ship building. To build ships, I need money. I earn money by building outposts and extracting materials that I use for various upgrades and manufacturing, and the rest of those I sell. The other way I earn money is by doing side missions that I stumble upon accidentally while exploring or picking them up on mission boards. There are other ways to earn money of course, but this is how I do it, because it’s interesting for me.
When I do a couple of missions and check the outposts, I’ve earned enough money to construct or upgrade ships, which is the ultimate goal. Ship building is by far the best aspect of the game for me and most of my hours are spent there. You are basically free to construct your own ship from your imagination, and the feeling when you walk around your ship that you made is great and immersive.
The best thing about all of this is that if you're not interested in ship or outpost building, you just don't have to do it and do your own thing.

Addressing the Biggest Complaints

Loading screens: To be honest, if I had the option to land seamlessly on a planet from space, I probably would once or maybe twice, but that's it. I mean I really wouldn't want to waste my time on stuff like that, and I'm glad I don't have to. Would I want to go seamlessly through cities and buildings without loading screens? Sure, but it’s not a deal breaker for me, because a game of this size obviously has its technical limitations, and I mean, most loadings are like a second or two.
“Not enough points of interest and repetitiveness”: I mean, it’s space. Space is mostly empty. If they made a few planets with handmade stuff, then everyone would be like ""yeah, space game with 4 planets..."". You wouldn't even feel the size and vastness that space offers.

A Game to Take Slow

This is a slow game that lets you do your own thing. It’s not a game to rush, but to take it slowly and methodically, and enjoy the scenery in the process. It's a game that offers a large variety of systems to interact with, and is good at most of them, and excellent in some.
Do I think that this is a perfect game? Of course not, not even close, but for someone who is into space stuff, I think it’s great. Does it have the most interesting side quests? No, but they are good enough to enjoy most of them, and some are great with twists at the end. Do I want bigger and more dense cities? Sure, but it’s not that these are not enough for what they are supposed to be, especially Neon. Do I want better companions and dialogues? Sure, but it’s not so bad as to be unable to enjoy or care about a few of them. Are there various minor aspects that annoy me? Of course, and I solve those minor things with mods.
I didn’t even go through the main quest, and currently it’s not even my goal, and I think that the story is good so far and gives you things to think about. I won’t discuss Shattered Space DLC, because I haven’t played it yet.

Who This Game Is (and Isn’t) For

People who are searching for action-packed, fast-paced combat with bombastic cut scenes will be disappointed. Those who want to interact with various systems and exploit them and take it slow and relaxing, with occasional action, will enjoy this game. And I think that it’s great, because we have action-packed games in abundance, but not many games like this.

Final Thoughts

I think that the base game and its foundation is great for what it is supposed to be and offers a lot of potential for further upgrading and improvements.

The writing definitely can be a bit jarring at times, especially with certain storylines in the game. I'm also not a fan of how the leveling system is handled, with the perk tree requiring certain tasks being done in order to unlock the next level of a perk. There are also some hub locations that have so much potential that leave so much to be desired (my choices being New Atlantis, Akila City, and Neon). I have plenty of other things to say, but I'd rather avoid repeating the same talking points that have been parroted by others over the last year and a half. I can't say that I love this game, but I don't hate it outright. But still, I do want this game to get a hell of a redemption arc like Cyberpunk 2077, Battlefield 4, Halo MCC...and yes, even No Man's Sky, one of the games that Starfield gets compared to the most (the others being Elite Dangerous and Scam Citi- I mean Star Citizen). In short, while I can't recommend this game, it also shouldn't be outright ignored by anyone, both players and Bethesda alike...there's a lot of potential here, waiting to be tapped into.

Starfield,1716740,192821342,"I've been with Bethesda a while. From Morrowind to now, I've enjoyed my time. When I heard about Starfield, I was very excited. If they had simply put Skyrim in space, this game would be wildly popular. However, that's not what happened.

I made my way through the main story. It was not bad and relatively free of bugs. That was a relief and a surprise given the numerous mistakes of the past. However, I didn't feel good about the story. I've never liked being the main character and quickly started a new character upon completing it.

With my new character, I more or less ignored the main story and opted to do things my way. Explore, try out new things, play the game my way. That did not go so well. I quickly found that pretty much every game system had tons of bugs. I couldn't build a reasonable outpost. Rocks kept following my ships around causing the game to crash. Quests didn't work. Everything I have come to expect from the open alphas we call game releases quickly came true for Starfield.

This was very frustrating, so I turned to mods. Mods are what saved Skyrim, and maybe they could do the same for Starfield. Not so much. Mods added a lot, allowed me to play my character more freely, design better outposts, build better ships, avoid poorly thought out systems from the original game and so on. However, it was still the same problem. The base game is so rigid and unforgiving. Everything looks and feels like it was half developed and there are simply not enough mods to fix it.

So, I gave up. Maybe after the modders have a decade with it, the original game will be mostly gone and a new better Starfield will be born from the generic ashes. Go buy something else. This is not it.",False,4,25313

The many complaints in the reviews and the forums are obsolete in that modders have fixed all major game flaws. I will dismantle here the many complaints:

- A 'Perk Wall' system where you don't get immediately all the goodies. Right, did you play other Bethesda games? Hello...
- Fast-Travel is against immersion. Right, but you don't have to do it, fly manually to every orbit first before landing.
- POIs on planets are all the same? NO. Not anymore since there are good free mods to load, some of them linked to mission boards also, some doing their own story. 
- The story sucks? Maybe for you. Don't play the story, get missions on mission boards, explore, make your own story.
- You can't fly over planet surfaces? You don't have to, there is a vehicle in the game now to move faster and with the last update you can explore the entire planet surface (the map moves with you and procedurally generates unknown territory of the planet as you move on the map.)

All the negative arguments against the game are poorly justified, SF remains in the tradition of other Bethesda games, that was and is to be expected, before you think to buy it don't forget that SF is much more an RPG in space, not a space game.

Starfield,1716740,192774611,"Starfield... is a game with one thousand planets. And it works.

As Todd Howard would say... ""It just works."" And functionally, he's right. It is perhaps Bethesda's least buggy game to date. But here's the thing about functionality it doesn't always equal soul.

You travel from planet to planet, each one a barren husk of potential, a cosmic sandbox with nothing to do but find rocks. Temples float in space, offering you powers that are essentially Skyrim shouts... in space. And somehow, that sentence sounds more exciting than the experience itself.

The quests... are boring. There’s no other way to put it. Your companions? Equally boring. All paragons of virtue, like they were assembled in a lab focused on creating the most inoffensive AI personalities. They all agree with you. They all love when you make good choices. It’s like adventuring with a team of HR representatives.

And when you pick a space religion... the game nods. Once. Maybe twice. Then forgets. Role-playing in Starfield is not a journey. It’s a costume. A trait that’s only skin-deep.

The Settled Systems the world Bethesda spent years crafting feels like the sci-fi version of a gated community. It is sterile. Sanitized. A place where nothing dares to offend. A future built by people who listened to John Lennon’s Imagine... and took it literally. It is perhaps the safest vision of a post-colonial space civilization ever conceived in gaming.

This... is Bethesda at its worst.

Gone are the messy but passionate days of Skyrim. Even Fallout 4, divisive as it was, had something Starfield lacks: fun. You could lose yourself in that world. You could mod it into something wild, chaotic, beautiful.

And mods... haven’t saved Starfield. Maybe they can’t. The community hasn’t embraced it the way they did before. And Bethesda, ironically, has started selling paid mods on their storefront. So even creativity now comes with a price tag.

What are we left with?

A game that ""just works.""

And tragically... that's the best thing you can say about it.

Quests? Dull.
Lore? A shadow of what it once was.

Starfield,1716740,192764124,"The game follows the typical Bethesda formula of combat, explore, collect, craft known from their Fallout and Elder Scrolls series. This is a space setting, and I generally like those. I can forgive the loading screens that the game was so heavily critised for. It is weird that the game launched without ground vehicles. The cities are not meant to be travelled by vehicles, and vehicles are overpowered if used in combat. Vehicles do not feel like a natural part of the game. While the vehicles seem overpowered, the player can visit temples to acquire supernatural powers, but I hardly felt a need to use these powers during the game.

Like with other Bethesda games befor it, I find myself walking around too much, carrying around too much. The only solution the game offers to this problem is to get rid of superfluous things myself. I cannot command robots around me to deposit stuff for me on the ship.  I also have to visit shops, the vanilla game does not offer buying or selling by galactic mail. With the need for walking a lot, the game actually falls behind our current times.

I have completed the quest achievements in the main game, and I enjoyed the game enough to play a ""new game +"", where I can replay the game while keeping my character. However, many achievements actually focus on things that are quite boring to do, like visiting every star system or reaching a high character level, Those are boring achievements that reward mindless repetition rather than creative thinking.

While some of the quests are well-written with surprising twists, I wish that other quests had more possible solutions. The mission that felt most incomplete was ""First Contact"", where you have to choose between helping the crew of a generation ship or a corrupt board of leaders who simply happened to arrive first on a planet. Unfortunately, the game does not offer a really satisfying solution to this mission. A fair ending would see both factions governing the planet together, at least until my next space jump. Failing that, the board of executives deserves a thorough treatment with ranged weapons for their arrogance. While the game allows me to blow up the generation ship by overloading their reactor, a similar solution is not offered for the corrupt board of leaders down on their cozy planet, and that feels unfair, although I am allowed to bring ranged weapons to the meetings. The solution of leaving the crew of the generation ship as slaves really feels wrong. ""New game +"" allowed to follow this route to see if there is anything good about this choice, but it really left me feeling bad for a crew who struggled for generations to reach that planet.

Starfield,1716740,192704071,"A good game.  Wonderful environments that are rendered well.  Good voice acting, and the story is decent, but certainly nothing amazing, and the dialogue is silly at times.  The faction quests are excellent, and some of the side quests and companion quests are quite good as well.  Space combat might not be as exciting as something like 'Everspace 2' or 'Elite Dangerous' or even the old 'Freelancer' game, but I've enjoyed it, and this is partly due to the truly excellent shipbuilding/modifying that you can do (this is one of the game's strengths).

The game's ground combat is quite good, but the base-building and trading is mediocre at best (IMHO).  I did feel like the main factions should be busy building and doing things and a dynamic economy would be nice.  More should be done to make the game's world feel alive.  That is, after all, one of Bethesda's stated goals--to create the feeling of stepping into a living world when you play their games.  However, the world of 'Starfield' feels static and unresponsive.

Also, even though the environments are great (Neon, Akila, New Atlantis, Mars, Titan, etc.), they're too small.  For example, the base on 'Titan' looks great, and the moon is surprisingly realistically created, but the base on Titan is supposed to be like an underground town or small city.  There's even a place where the poorer people live, and you're expecting a village, something like the crates section in 'Cyberpunk 2077' (with the expansion), but instead it's only a few people living in a couple crates--not a slum.  It needs to be bigger to at least create the illusion that this is a town.  For the price and Bethesda's resources, I think they should have delivered a bit more in this regard.

Finally, I should mention that there are a lot of mods and dlc available when you go into ""Creations"", which is nice (though you'll have to pay for points, but the prices are reasonable).  Some of the content comes from within Bethesda while others are from independent modders, and some of the additional content is quite good, so that's always a nice bonus.  Lot of mods on Nexus too.

To summarize, this is not a perfect game, but it is a very good one, and it's about the most realistic futuristic sci-fi game I can think of.  However, with that realism does come some drawbacks.  Most planets in outer space are either lifeless rocks or gas giants, so if you want the feeling of exploring outer space as it actually is, this game was meant for you.  If you want an action-packed space opera, you'll probably be disappointed.  This game is more '2001: A Space Odyssey' than it is 'Star Wars'.  More 'Star Trek 1' than 'Star Trek 2'.",True,2,21624

But the difference with Starfield is every time I come back and create a new character I always end up getting bored and falling off at the same point, normally around the time that the game fully opens up and you can build bases, or get new ships and customise them. I think that's because it's around this point you remember, or if you're playing for the first time you discover, that this game is just an empty shell with nothing but copy paste activities and an incredibly uninteresting main story and side stories that just leave me feeling absolutely nothing inside afterwards. I have to admit they did a tremendous job promoting this game and letting our imagination run wild with the possibilities that this game had to offer, advertising it as a ""Skyrim in space"" type of game, but that set the bar too high and I cannot and will not bring that bar down to where this game actually sits because skyrim was full of fun an interesting things to do, this game has none of that.

That is the most entertaining part of this game, the shipbuilding, which is really just a minigame.

I played most of my time right when it came out, and every few months I come back and try to finish the game. I only play for an hour or so before getting bored.

Starfield,1716740,192625235,"It has been one and a half years since the game was released, and it's still a buggy mess. Within three minutes of loading the game, I encountered a failed transition/load screen that prevented me from powering up my ship and geometry that almost completely blocked my view. When I got out of the pilot seat, I was greeted by the wireframe meshes of my ship intersecting with another that was a part of a random event (UC Ship Seeking Repair Parts). Upon reloading, I discovered that my newly acquired and upgraded ship had a reactor bug that had caused the power of my replaced reactor to be added to my new reactor, giving me 32 power instead of 18. As I set course to land on a planet, I was greeted with a load screen that showed my ship oddly tilted forward as it landed, resulting in the landing gear and landing bay being embedded in the terrain. Not to mention that I previously had to turn down all of my graphics settings to prevent the game from crashing. 

Reflecting on the game's issues with quality control and technical limitations, its overly simplistic approach to storytelling, and its cookie-cutter approach to game design. I'm left with the impression that Starfield's game design and development are deeply rooted in a culture of insecurity and risk aversion, which is driven from the top down (This may explain their sale to Microsoft). Such that if its graphics were stripped away, you could be forgiven for confusing it with a game developed 20 years ago, yet it's no Freelancer (2003), and it's certainly no Mass Effect (2007).

Ultimately, Starfield feels like a safe game that exists more for the financial safety of its developer, publisher and owner than the enjoyment of its audience. To achieve this, it appears that the developer has been compelled to cut a lot of corners and remove any rough edges that may have jeopardised the game’s general appeal. Resulting in what is overall a bland and empty experience that has had to be taped together using loading screens.  

Can it be a fun game? At times, Yes. 
Does it deserve an approval rating of 58%? Also Yes.

Starfield,1716740,192609711,"8/10 game.  Solid good fun if you like Space RPG set in a space-faring future, with a minor factory-automation system build in as well.  
Yes it is a bit glitchy sometimes, it's built on the same engine and by the same team as the Fallout series so don't expect perfection. 
Yes there are a lot of totally barren planets where the only thing to do is look at the stars... but the stars are lovely. 
And there are also several worlds with wildlife and a small ecology:  small scavengers, larger herbivores, and predators.  The herbivores usually leave you alone, but the predators look at you and see ""dinner.""
And other worlds might have small cities, or pirate bases, or strange alien ruins, or good spots to mine for ore, ... 
And you can decorate the inside of your ship or your home with some pretty nice furniture, too, if that's your thing.
And there are a lot of mods... though most of them try to turn it into a Star Wars game for some reason.

Now, honestly, as vast as the galaxy is... it's very empty.  There are more barren uninhabited planets than there are worlds that support life (as we know it).  But it's all there for you, if you choose to see it.  And even on barren worlds you'll sometimes find a random event happening... like a space-pirate attack, or a happy meeting with a group of travelers.  You'll build and fly your own spaceship... in fact you can own a whole fleet and swap between them anytime you land at a spaceport.  Use your ship to battle pirates, or to become a pirate yourself.  Steal enemy ships... then sell them or keep them for your own collection.  Or become a mining magnate by building outposts on various worlds to extract resources like iron, neodymium, and the galaxy's fuel source of choice - helium-3.  Or build a more advanced system of outposts and automate factories across the galaxy to pull resources in from various planets where you have mines, and turn them into manufactured goods that are worth more when you sell them.  Or you can just fly around looking for ""random events"" to happen.  The galaxy isn't totally devoid of life, but there is definitely more empty space than inhabited space. 

The main quest will have you working with a company of explorers and scientists to find a bunch of strange alien artifacts, and eventually you'll start to gain super-powers.  Nothing super flashy, but it will make you feel like you might not be entirely human anymore.  And then you meet a reclusive group who... well I won't spoil it for you, get out there and see it for yourself.  Along the way, you can join up with the pirates, the frontier cops, the space-navy, or ALL of them.  You'll build and fly your own ship, which you can DECORATE inside and out.  You can even buy a house and decorate it, too... several options are available in the vanilla game and a few more throughout the galaxy if you look for mods.

Combat - both on foot and in space - is pretty simple to figure out, not terribly difficult.  But it's not supposed to be ""really hard"" it's supposed to make you feel tough when you can wipe out a team of pirate raiders and steal their ship... hehe.

For building outposts (for mining and factory) I recommend you go watch some YouTube videos on how to be successful.  The system is not super intuitive to learn, but once you figure it out it's actually not that hard.

The game also comes with a ""Creations"" system where you can download officially supported mods from the community.  SOME of them cost ""creation credits"" which you have to spend real money to buy.  But there are a lot of free mods, and the ones you can find (mostly for free) on Nexus Mods website also work if you know how to install them right - which is easy.
But even if mods aren't your thing, there will be two that you will find ABSOLUTELY INDESPENSIBLE and they should have been included in the main game from day one.  You'll have to buy about ten bucks of creation credits to get them though, they are not available for free.  The first is ""Astrolabe"" which adds a search bar to your map of the galaxy, so you don't get lost as often.  The second is ""Compendium"" which is a cross-referenced catalog of all the ores, minerals, gases, plants, animals, etc. on each planet.  If you plan to build outposts this tool will be your very best friend.  Aside from those, there are mods that make the game HARDER, and there are mods that feel like you're cheating, and mods that make it ""prettier,"" and mods that add more weapons, armors, and spaceship pieces into the game.  It's a sandbox, much like Fallout 3 and 4 were, but with a larger scope.  

But is it FUN?  It can be.  If you enjoy immersive RPG set in a sci-fi space-faring future.  Or if you enjoy factory automation in a LIGHTWEIGHT style, no min/maxing needed.  Or if you want a game that makes it feel like you're a character in a movie for a little while.  I'm enjoying it. 

New Game + takes away all your items, all your money, your spaceships, your quest progress... 
But you keep your unlocked skills, your XP levels, and they give you a pretty cool spaceship and spacesuit-armor set when you reboot the universe.  The point of NG+ is to go around the galaxy and collect all the artifacts again, while simultaneously exploring MORE alien temples that improve your super-powers.  Those powers can be leveled up like that 10 times, so you can get some benefit from playing 10 NG+ universe reboots... but that will take FOREVER and even I will probably get bored after the first or second NG+ run.

starfield's space and exploration aesthetic, as well as the bethesda DNA (yes!  it's still there, just perhaps in its worst form), are doing a lot of the heavy lifting for me, but its numerous flaws and sloppy, half-hearted execution in nearly all aspects of the game prevent it from being an authentically great one.  it's a shame, because even the most unforgiving player can see the boundless potential this game could have, but will never come to fruition, given the state of today's bethesda.  and don't even get me started on how outdated the creation engine is...over a decade and they still can't figure out why many outfits -- vanilla or modded -- sometimes don't load and remain invisible.

Starfield's not lacking in any of these.

-------------------------
Worlds
-------------------------
Starfield is rife with beautiful worlds that are absolutely photo-worthy, and all of them are procedurally generated outside of specific instances. If you think Star Citizen's are not procedurally generated, you really may want to think that one over. Core instances are not, but the rest absolutely is. (Probably serverside. But you know not every mountain and field is hand crafted.) Starfield's biggest problem there is that it has such a limited array of POIs and interactions. Yeah, it's really weird to find a cave with bones on Luna, and there really should be measures to prevent that. But, that's what happens when you build a single player game designed to compete with overhuge MMOs. I'd have narrowed Starfield's focus quite a bit were I in charge. Be that as it may, my gallery of amazing sights only grows.

I can not overstate the level of achievement Bethesda managed to pull off here, with Starfield's ""Settled Systems"". The amount of thought and effort put into each planet's properties, orbits, the ways they interact with each other, it's some really mind boggling stuff. Elite's is easily the best of that, but their engine is designed for it.

Somehow, Starfield did that on Creation. I *still* do not know how.

-------------------------
Characters
-------------------------

Constellation's cast is fantastic. As is The Vanguard's. The Freestar Rangers are great too. UC Sysdef and Crimson Fleet are if nothing else, memorable, and Ryujin's characters, while honestly odd in the context of a space exploration game, was really good too.

I don't know many characters from Elite. Everything they do happens in the background with no meaningful impact on the world. I've never heard of a character from Star Citizen, and No Man's Sky is anathema to the concept of characters. All three of those games are big open worlds where you and the other players are characters. I know that NPCs you can run into in NMS are apparently memorable, but nobody's ever given me a name.

But I can tell you the story of Sam Coe, a single father who's really struggling with it. I can tell you about Andreja, the displaced member of House Va'ruun. I could go on about Sarah Morgan, a woman who's had a lifetime of adventures in the last decade. Goodness knows I can talk to you about Barrett. That's just four examples. They're very well acted, well thought out, meaningfully interactive characters. They'll call back to actions of yours, things you've said, even their romances feel really good. I'm a very married woman who loves my wife very much, and it's actually quite impressive to me how genuine the acting and presentation of interpersonal relationships feels. Given the game is about how we all effect one another, how we deal with loss, moving on with the world and life, this shouldn't come as a surprise, but the characters of Starfield deserve recognition. I really like them all, even the utter bastards.

-------------------------
Story
-------------------------

Elite doesn't really have a story. It has a developing narrative that the devs guide gently. Yeah, the Thargoid invasion happened and those of us who participated in it had an effect - but to say it's a story is... lacking, I think. Star Citizen wholly lacks one, and frankly I'm not sure what No Man's Sky's is.

Starfield, though? Starfield is about discovering a mystery beyond your comprehension, but you get wrapped up in it. Starfield is about becoming part of something more and meeting new people, about learning who they are and what they've been through. You're likely the youngest gun in Constellation outside of Cora Coe, but your accompanying cast is all in their 30s and 40s, some even beyond that in their 50s and 60s. Walter Stroud is a rare character that way. I know this is the story section, but I have to go off about how aged a majority of the case is. Nobody's truly new to the job, but everyone's going into this mystery unprepared and ill equipped. The characters are all mature, and have beliefs and convictions informed by their lives.

You end up discovering what the story about the artifacts is, what they lead to, why they're being collected. It's a cosmic mystery without much of a definitive answer, but the answer really lies in how it makes you feel. On my main, I won't go into NG+. but going through just one NG+ has left a profound impact on me... and that's not even getting into what happened to me when The Death, occurred.

Few games have made me stop everything to put it all down and cry. Starfield has, and continues to. Fallout can make me sad, The Elder Scrolls can make me think and maybe even be mad, but Starfield can make me *cry*.

-------------------------
Universe
-------------------------

Elite, NMS, and Star Citizen do all have well thought out universes with factions and characters and gameplay that is informed by it. I won't deny that. It'd be intellectually dishonest to assert otherwise. Elite's is far future and a bit blase to me, Star Citizen's world is... I mean as unfinished as the product, and truth be told I know little about NMS' world. But I do know about Starfield's.

Starfield's world, its universe (and beyond) is a NASA Kid's playground (Hi, that's me! NASA kid! Through and through.) Starfield is for the stargazer. For the kid who wanted to be an astronaut, who wanted to be aboard a space shuttle. Starfield is for that person. It isn't for the person looking for a sci-fi military epic or a huge war, it's *about* the wonder of space, and the universe informs that. I could go on about the ""Set design"" of the ships, particularly Nova Galactic's interiors (AUUGGHH SO GOOD), about how the food is all thoughtfully packaged, about how the CHUNKS brand is inspired by existing space foods (technically, it ought to be some kind of hexagonal shape. But a cube of Sauvingon is just... *chef's kiss*), about how the spacesuits are big, baggy, clunky. About how almost every door is an airlock (even if that IS annoying!). The whole *world* is built around not just exploring space, but *living* in it. Which I just... don't get from the other games, who feel Transient by comparison. It's such a shame then, that Starfield's outpost building is quite lackluster.

Look, I've played Oblivion, Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76; Starfield clearly builds off of 76's C.A.M.P. system but I have encountered a couple of bugs that I have NEVER come across from any of the aforementioned Bethesda games.

I know, I KNOW, ""Bethesda games are buggy,"" I get it, and yet I have not witnessed the bugs in their previous games that I have witnessed in Starfield.
Literally my first Weapons Bench placed and it says it's obstructed so I can't use it.
I tried moving it, reloading a save, loading a prior save, etc yet to no avail.

As I said, do NOT pay $69.99 for this game.

The graphics are beautiful, but I personally don't give a rat's ass about the graphics.
I care about a smooth gaming experience with minimal, not non-existent just minimal, bugs.

So get this when it's at its lowest and you won't regret it, but buy it at its full price, because you've been fiending for a new Bethesda RPG, and you'll be sitting here thinking ""When will I learn not to buy AAA games at their full price?"" just like me.

Hope this helps.

Procedurally generated environments have nothing to offer and successfully remind you how boring irl space actually is. IF you want to explore regardless, you have to deal with the fact that you get constantly dragged out of the flow by a million loading screens. The lore and story is weak, uninteresting and feels like an afterthought. Which makes the roleplaying boring as well.
The only thing this game is good at is making me still angry that I bought it.",False,146,4897
Starfield,1716740,192489847,"This game is seriously, seriously underrated, in a way nobody and everybody seems to be looking for at the same time.

Many call it ""boring"". But you know what it is? Deeply, deeply relaxing. A universe to explore to yourself, run locally, no DRM or servers that will go down some day, without grand themes of a space opera, or saving the universe, or having the burden of the galaxy on your shoulders. No choices with insane consequences for everyone and everything. There's you, your ship, a vast universe in front of you, (genuinely well written! see below) friends besides you, and wherever the road takes you, and choices that affect people along the way. That's it. People. Help or hurt people if you're so inclined.

We all want freedom of choice. To make our own fun. Well *this is it*. Do you really want it? I vote yes. This is my universe to retreat to and I like it *because* it's less grand, and closer to reality. *Science* fiction, not science fantasy. That makes it comforting, to see a universe where there's giant crises sure, but they can be understood. And people just do their thing. As people. Not grand overlords, or larger than life heroes. People who do their best. No elder gods, no blending of science and spiritualism, just a ship around me, interesting characters beside me, the stars in front of me. Adventures that really are *adventures*, of my own making or not.

I really do like the characters. They're not dependent on dangling fancy character designs in front of our eyes like jangling keys, because they're written to be...well, people. Like you meet on the street, for good and bad.  And as far as the main cast goes I really dig the voice acting.  Background NPCs too, they're Fallout 4 quality at least. Pro tip, turn off the dialogue camera, everything *immediately* stops feeling like Oblivion and much much better.

Another great thing here; though the maps may be largely procedural, every single planet, plant, creature, is handcrafted in a very Bethesda way. Every single biome of every single planet will have completely different animals, but they're not procedurally generated sloppy-feeling things like No Man's Sky does (all of my love I could possibly give to that game though xoxo, another favorite). For example, I landed on a random iceball, and saw there were plants and animals...and suddenly got really freaked out, because the animals walking around had the same names as the plants. Apparently, on that small little rock, when the plants grow up enough, they get up, start walking, and start hunting. It was horrifying and so much more horrifying because it was completely wordless. Lots of stuff is like that, love it so much.

This is by *far* the best Bethesda engine for modding. One of the best for anything. This is a trillion times better to mod for than any of the other Bethesda games, that includes installing and creating. Some of the common tools don't work because not enough people have sat down and given this game a fair try, but installing manually is genuinely seamless. I'm not kidding. No mod manager and I think I'm up to 40+ and a script extender, and not light stuff either. I hope that illustrates how much less spaghetti code is going on here; I'm genuinely astounded. This is also my favorite shooter of them all even just using my controls.

Last note, a super interesting one to me, something is *deeply* atmospheric about this game. It's seriously creepy, but in a very, very Bethesda way. Something is not normal here. At all, in a very very interesting way. The thing that first struck me in an incredibly unnerving way was finding some familiar faces on the planet of Khayyam II, Khayyam system :) No spoilers from me, but keep your eyes on the wildlife there, and let me know if that freaks you the hell out like it did me. Very different but equally upsetting vibe from the walking plant planet, maybe a little worse.

Quick summary to wrap up:
Genuinely incredible game if you want to adventure through the stars without losing your mind stressing out trying to save them. Good Bethesda writing as much as anything ever was IMO, putting aside rose tinted glasses and recognizing *everything* else they do is no different, just this is a little subtler, was a life saver. Handcrafted creatures to find everywhere you go. No DRM, no servers that will ever go down, really good modding capacity, good ship and ground combat, good vibes all around. I guess the question I would recommend you ask most when deciding whether or not to buy this is, do you want yet another ""reinventing the wheel from the ground up, this must be everything"" game? Cause that's valid. Do you want a really, really, really good RPG that knows what it is, does its best to be a really good RPG without throwing the genre out with the bathwater? That's valid too. If you picked the second answer, I recommend this game more than anything else for years, and years, and years. This gives you *so much freedom* in *balance* with you as a player. It's not your galaxy, but your life to live and path to wander in it. Seems like a lot of people *cough cough organized review bombers* don't want freedom like they think they do.",True,2,37460

One of the things I love about Bethesda's previous games, like the Fallout and Elder Scroll series, is that the world's felt large and textured.  Unfortunately, Starfield feels rather shallow and small.  Some have expressed the opinion that it's the games heavy reliance on fast travel, which is certainly part of it, but I believed it's largely because of the way it uses procedural generation. 

Beyond the relatively few specific locations Bethesda created, once the novelty wears of, the rest of what's being generated quickly becomes repetitive and boring.  So instead of using it flesh out a world,  it's hundreds of worlds with the same hand full of structures and environments.  Loot is everywhere, credits are easy to obtain, base building isn't all that important, and player homes are largely just storage and cosmetic.",False,1,8197

Starfield,1716740,192478827,"[h1] I don't know. I tried to like this game. Maybe it isn't for me. [/h1]

I guess I'll write my review based on their talking points in the Steam listing. This was my experience based on my play style, if you enjoyed the game, I'm glad.

[i]""Tell Your story""[/i] 5/10
The character creation is as Bethesda as ever, that being quite in-depth. I guess you can Tell Your story, but the background you choose doesn't really affect your gameplay that much aside from dialogue and the occasional speech check pass. It's a nice touch, but not very well fleshed out. Traits have a bigger impact on your gameplay.

[i]""Explore Outer Space""[/i] 4/10, too much reliance on procedural generation
Yep, you can certainly do that. I don't think ""more than 1,000 planets"" should be a selling point (and hyped so much in their Starfield Direct livestreams). There's POIs (Buildings you can infiltrate and loot) - there's probably a dozen or so prefab ""DANGEROUS BASES"" that are procedurally generated across most planets, which sucks. I know they wanted their universe to be just as vast and lifeless as real life space, but it just didn't work in Starfield. I know, LOOK, another Mass Effect comparison! But I think they portrayed the vast nature of outer space in Mass Effect 2 just fine: have a couple dozen very well fleshed out locations (sure, not full planets in ME2, but Starfield could have expanded on that), and open the rest of the planets to extract resources from your ship.

[i]""Meet and recruit a memorable cast of characters""[/i] 5/10
I've experienced my share of memorable characters in games, but the writing in this game is just off. I went through all of the main companion's storylines, and honestly, I don't remember 75% of what I did with them. The only cast of characters I actually remember quite well (not recruitable) is from [spoiler] Operation Starseed, one of my favorite side quests. If you played it, you know it. [/spoiler] Ultimately a lot of my playthrough was solo unless a companion was required.

[i]""Join in the adventures of various factions""[/i] 6/10
Okay, sure, I did like the UC faction storyline. I forgot what I did with the Freestar and Crimson, and Ryujin was not enjoyable imo.

[i]""Captain the Ship Of Your Dreams""[/i] 7/10
They made ships you can move in space. A first for Bethesda games. And honestly, the ship builder is awesome. I spent a good few hours making my dream ship. Then, I realized how pointless space travel was. ""High-stakes dogfights"" can be tedious as space combat is tedious. ""Encounter random missions"" actually had some decent side quests. It's not mentioned, but the random encounters are fun.

[i]""Discover, Collect, Build""[/i] 4/10
Discover: Fun for the first hour or two (coming from someone with hundreds of hours in No Man's Sky)
Collect: Tedious.
Build: The outpost system is an afterthought. I'd rather just buy the resources I need to craft stuff, but I can see the joy to some from exploring and collecting resources that might be limited to specific planets.

[i]""Lock and Load""[/i] 8/10
Gunplay is fun, actually a good step up from Fallout 4. Melee is an afterthought.

[i]""Engaging and Tense Storyline""[/i] 6/10 ONLY because of NG+
Oh, wait. That's not in the description. Storyline is 5/10. Again, the writing is just off. The way Bethesda puts it in the description [i]""You will join Constellation – the last group of space explorers seeking rare artifacts throughout the galaxy – and navigate the vast expanse of space in Bethesda Game Studios’ biggest and most ambitious game""[/i] makes it seem (TO ME) more like a sandbox title than an action RPG with an engaging story you need to follow. Once I got down to the last few missions in my first playthrough, I ended up basically speedrunning them because I was just kind of over it. I did play through a few times with NG+ and [spoiler]some of the variations actually shook things up, which was fun. I ended up installing a mod that allowed me to choose which variation I wanted just to see them all.[/spoiler]

[b]Graphics & Engine Rant:[/b] 7/10
Decent graphics, but underwhelming for a 2023 release, and the game doesn't run well for how it looks. I would be impressed if this released in 2018. I know it's your pride and joy, Bethesda, but when I saw the Creation Engine 2 reveal, I knew it would be more of the same jank. And, once I opened your Creation Kit, I discovered it is (mostly) the same jank, just updated. The game is a loading screen simulator - seriously, even loading into tiny buildings. (Seriously, Bethesda, you were developing the game for Xbox Series consoles, which have extremely fast SSDs). At least load times were actually decent unlike Fallout 4.

Soundtrack 6/10. That's all I have to say. It was kinda generic but good enough to where I generally didn't have to put on my own music in the background while playing.

Ultimately, Starfield is a flawed game and I am surprised it took this long to develop, even factoring in updating the game engine to Creation Engine 2. I think the entire review can be summed up by their Steam description: [i]""Starfield is the first new universe in 25 years from Bethesda Game Studios, the award-winning creators of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4.""[/i] It's certainly a new Universe from an award-winning game studio. A game that I can see people actually enjoy. One that has so much potential and so many great ideas and so much incredible talent behind the name, but it was over-hyped by Xbox, who wasn't really going through the best of times this console generation, and it ultimately underdelivered.

The worst part is, I pre-ordered the $299 Collector's Edition for a carrying case and a watch that feels almost as cheap as your McDonald's Shrek watch, and an underwhelming DLC release. Sorry Bethesda, I know I did this to myself, but never again. Maybe I'll install the game when more game-changing mods release, but it's not worth my 135GB of storage space right now.

Starfield,1716740,192477419,"If I had to describe this game in a single word, there is no better word to use than 'mediocre'. This is the word that comes to mind for the majority of quest in this game, but not only that, it is also the mechanics that are not longer a 'fun feature' but a sign of stagnation, the 'big cities' which are mostly greenery and boulevards with the same old Fallout-type shops, the 'stealth' mechanics in a game that has less need for them than even Skyrim because of it's horrendous design in this aspect, vendors with too few credits, brainless combat 'ai' if you can even call that intelligence, the all present bugs, etc. Is not that Bethesda bit more than it could chew, is that they just became complacent, they seem to rejoice in mediocrity. 

I mean, is the same old Bethesda trope but with a reskin. The problem is that it does not have the backing of a good lore to somewhat hold it up like TES or Fallout (which mechanically are also mediocre games) and we are no longer in the early 2010's. We now have  games like The Witcher 3 Wildhunt, Cyberpunk 2077, Baldur's Gate 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverance 1 and 2. All 4 games put Starfield to shame in world-building, gameplay mechanics and RPG elements, and I'm not even going to mention space exploration with games like No Man's Sky or even Astroneer do way better.

I'm still probably going to complete the main story and maybe play the dlc too, but I won't buy TES 6 if it's going to be this same crap again. Quit the bs with the ""physics-based"" Creation Engine like it's the cure for cancer and make a proper 2020's game. Oh!, and do your self a favor a fire Pagliarulo, that man has been the worst disaster to ever happen to Bethesda. 

There's an allegory that goes ""the size of an ocean and the dept of a puddle"".

Positives:

- Non Linear RPG Space Adventure 
- A ton of RPG style customization
- Art style is epic and beautiful. Sprawling vast landscapes and BEAUTIFUL ship interiors. Love the bases and computer systems. Everything looks like 1990s NASA but way more futuristic lol. A lot of white.
- Various companions that you can customize in terms of gear and your relationship
- Space travel with a custom ship that includes space combat (NMS does this part better yes)
- It feels like a familiar experience. Feels like Fallout in space. Even the music.
- Feels endless if you want it to be
- Full Base building
- Combat is brutal and fun. Good ragdoll and the gravity will come into play

Cons: 

- The writing and voice acting isn't amazing if you compare it to something like Cyberpunk, but it is still good. The trackers Alliance was really cool for example and I really enjoyed meeting all those bounty hunters and hearing their stories. Main story is cool. 

- Too many menu screens when doing space travel, but its not game breaking to me at all
- I wish I could give orders to my companions in combat
- Some dialogue is sleep inducing and too many npcs have things to say lol (Some might like this)
- Melee combat could be better with the sword imo

Get the mod that always shows landings and takeoffs from the ingame mod section, it should be free or a similar one - should of been done by the games designers, its just way better and makes you not fast travel as much, which in due time is just better for immersion. Then the mod to lower/raise the ramp.  I also get/had to get the inventory and UI mods starUI but I make sure to run starui as vanilla UI - since the UI itself is really good but on PC you want them to run at 60+ fps.  The characters are great but the 'philosophy' not so much in all cases.  Which is meaning to say when this game is not tripping over itself, like someone came in after the fact and changed things for the worse, then its really good from voice acting to the models and the story's.  Long story short you will probably like this game now, many patches, performance upgrades, and whatnot.   

Good story, plenty to do, its a game you can sink your teeth into over time.  I would not preface my recommendation by saying the gameplay is not 'peak anything' or a jack of all trades, the game stands in its own right, but you should take steps to make it less bullet spongy, which is not hard to do.   

Loading screens yes but they go quick, you can grab 100s of objects in a scene, maybe its like that for a reason, just now.  

Got HD textures and planets.  

Lighting - I used enhanced lights and effects.  The lighting and global illumination is very good and shadows, but the aforementioned mod gets over the toned-down for consoles lighting sources.  Its a solid engine though.  Could be upgraded. I made shadows darker via numerous settings as per a mod suggestion.  

I raised variables in the starfield custom file for lighting, some mods tell you to do this, also did it for trees and landscape, another mod gave settings - so I raised one reflections setting its clear where it is/named, to 512, another to 32 and so forth.  This made reflections even better, because the game includes a form of Ray Tracing sort of thing.  It does not need like some video's would have you believe total ray tracing, its still very good and the gains not as much as you might expect for the scene.  Yes technically RT is 'even better wow gee whiz' but for the art style and atmosphere and whatnot, no its not fully needed - you will find it beautiful for sure.  So, too the clouds and stuff - I used a weather mod which just enhanced weather.  Clouds might not be star citizen but the planets are great nonetheless.  If you get a minor proceedual generation mod to clean up a few design choices you might like it even better but pure vanilla is just fine.  One made trees variable in size and some such.  

This title does not need excessive amounts of mods.  Its already smooth and fine as a game + concept.  I have listed mods I did, as per the desire of people to mod it - but its just rounding it out.  It came to my attention they had to cut development short in terms of trappings and extra bits, but its definitely polished.  So mods round this out rather than fix or implement drastic changes.  

All that hinges on being able to change out the NPCs and also a few mods like starvival (turned way down though) and I play with combat set to hard and mine set to easy (so there's no bullet sponges) and you get an AI mod and you get fairly decent combat then.  Yeah so its excellent.  And some ship mods, and the oxygen mod from TNs oxygen mod (turn off starvivals oxygen) (also I turn off starvivals encumbrance system so you still get penalty's but nothing that slows you down
which was never a good answer).   I then of course turn down starvivals food hits and turns down the suit/soak damage and just overall its all a slight tweak for survival.  It should not be harsh as this game relies on smooth/switf movement through the universe, don't fall for the 'harder survival is better stuff', planets are still deadly.  

With all the changes you can make this title you might come to think of it as an 8.5 out of 10.  Skyrim might of been a 10/10, but without making changes especially to the NPCs as the story is reliant on non-ruined NPCs and situations (yes, they absolutely did ruin it and it needed changing; finance people making stakeholders instead of shareholders is a terrible idea, we made this world) then the title is too excruciating and would only get a 5 out of 10.  

I do think they should make it for PC first and not consoles, its a major reason (always why their games can be real bad upon release).  And the artwork and the planets and overall scale and style of the game is really good.  So good, probably one of its best elements - so it all blends in over time, you will almost certainly like this game if you adhere to the above, it'd be impossible not to like it.  

Also, I got a planet procedural mod but nothing drastic changing it just made trees random sized or something (grindfeilds one, but got rid of their others as its too much, planets are meant to be barren but you could get the biomes etc), and I made shadows darker, I would suggest do not use 'clear/neutral LUTS' the game's art style is very good.  I think one mod changes tree sizes up/down etc, but it does not make planets unrealistic, and I got some 'realistic' planet mods.  The game is very cool in many ways.

NPCs when not ruined are simply sublime.  I suggest making them how they should be.  Its a really good title, but caveats.  I have not run into one sub-par quest.  And the conversations take their time, are not wasteful/boring, and the voice acting and npc acting is good.  Yes you do need to change the NPC's its true.

How to put this? hmmm... imagine you are wacthing a cowboy - and you see it acting like a cowboy but its a girl and the wrong country and its doing something wrong because of that - its odd, you would immediately stop and say ""NO! Its not meant to be a gymnast! Its meant to be a cowboy on that horse!!!!""

See, it ruins the whole thing.  Thus you can find them.  A color fix mod but it does a lot of rearranging all the wrong NPCs, use that kinda search on based-mods.  So indeed I found one on based mods, the original mod didn't work for them but in the comments they had redone it, thus I finally found one, but I am sure it can be had elsewhere off the nexus.  

The one thing is I had to copy a folder from one of the two 'in the comments' mods and put it into the other update they did, so its really a combo of two mods - but also I had to start a new game so may be thats it.  

The industry has to change back to how it used to be, people have spoken.  Its manufactured to beat you down about it, no one likes what they did, thus it goes easily from 5/10 (forced ruined the game) to 8.5/10.  

Finally - yes there's a lot of loading, however yes the game would be even better if you could fly like star citizen but its not wholly disappointing its not in there - you miss it, sure, but its still a good game.  Planets are meant to be barren, dangerous wastelands.  The only other thing is building is not necessary, a missed opportunity.  But the space ships are good to have and fly nonetheless, you will probably like it because sure people detract from it a lot - but they are overplaying the detraction, its real good when you make it so.

Starfield,1716740,192340922,"Here's the thing. I think Starfield is Bethesda's best written game. It's not Bethesda's best story (I think Morrowind keeps that Dwemer Crown), and by far does NOT have it's best cast, but there's a lot of moments in this game that are truly inspired and thought provoking. Bethesda's writers tried to go out there and say something profound, and touch on subjects that truly feel like they touch the edge of the Universe and Life itself.

It's too bad the game is empty as the void truly is.

Sure, there's so many star systems and planets to explore, but you will never find ANYTHING that makes that exploration worth it. In the Elder Scrolls games, you might find a cave with cool weapons inside, a lone house  in the country with a cool quest to find, or some ruin that contains a challenging boss. In Starfield, the only thing you will ever find is man-made outposts full of bad guys with guns. And the only thing of worth you'll ever find are guns and spacesuits to sell.

The ship combat is decent, and while finding/stealing/building your own ships is potentially fun, trying to upgrade your ships is MADDENING. You need to level up multiple skills just to fly higher class ships and get higher class components, and even then trying to upgrade a vital component isn't possible unless you go into the build mode, delete said component and add in the better one... IF IT FITS. The ship building system could be fun but is horribly inconsistent about what parts will connect to one another. I wanted to keep using a few favorite ships, but this system completely blocked me from improving them despite seemingly existing FOR this purpose.

It gives me no pleasure to not recommend Starfield. I wanted to like it, and I played over 225 hours, but while I did find fun and some very profound moments, there was so much useless tedium between those moments, and it just wasn't all that fun.

Starfield,1716740,192275235,"I've finally got around to give a review.. honestly I share the same sentiment that a lot of other people have already shared. The game just feels empty. Vast emptiness. I just thought after a few years they would've been able to apply some QOL to the game but barely. 

Honestly, I loved the idea of the game- Exploring various planets, engaging with various factions, building bases, building ships, space fights that include boarding enemy ships, but man they just missed the mark. 

Allow me to explain:

-Base building is flawed. It's super frustrating building, whether you're snapping objects, placing objects(to find them glitch through the ground), lighting is atrocious; no matter how many lights you place it just doesn't light up the base and its fucking annoying, storage containers are just annoying managing and take up too much space, not to mention snapping the containers- it's just not easy doing and it seems as if that shouldn't be the case.

-Combat is really dumb. Like where's the diversity in gameplay? The NPCs are oblivious to everything, their accuracy or lack there of is ridiculous. There were very few moments that I felt challenged when it came to combat. The melee weapons are a joke, like you think that'd be quite the opposite, but yeah its a joke. There's a point where you find a weapon, I wont say what type, but it absolutely decimates enemies (the ammo is plentiful which makes it the best weapon in the game especially with its wicked fire rate), this makes it pointless in switching weapons. 

-Starborn powers are cool, but barely impactful. Not gonna lie, I played every faction quest line before finishing the main quest line and I feel like you get some powers way too late in the game. Your guns are powerful enough that the starborn powers don't really matter.

-Crafting reallllllllllllly was lacking in this game. While they offer different crafting options for attachments for guns and armor as well as food and other materials, it's very limited. Food crafting was such a let down. I invested in that perk to see what benefit I could gain from it and honestly, food barely helps, so it was just a waste of skill points. You spend all this time collecting materials, but for what???

-Factions were just poorly written. Like the Crimson Fleet were a huge let down. These are space pirates?? Like they weren't anything close to a space pirate. They were the equivalent to a high school bully. Absolutely nothing cutthroat about them at all. House Va’ruun should've been a more major rather than minor group with what lore was provided about them, but even they were paled in comparison to the Crimson fleet. Overall the politics between factions were very boring.

-NPCs were just.. very very very very boring. Talk about copy and paste. There wasn't anything unique about any of the NPCs. Nothing to cling to. Like they lacked substance- they're all quite forgettable. 

The ending was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo lame. Like this is how it ends??? This is it? I maxed my character level for this shit? It was super disappointing, I guess I was expecting something more? Like when I finished and went onto to NG+, I uninstalled the game. I mean you build up this arsenal, you advance on the tech/skill tree, you buy/build the best freighter/fighter ship, acquire the best weapons/armor of the game for an ending like this? Very very very anticlimactic.

Overall, I think that Bethesda pushed this out way too early and marketed the shit out of this game, squeezing every penny out of the consumer. I used to love this studio, but now disappointment is just a common thing. I really hope that they really listen to the player base and apply a lot of changes to the concerns that we all have.

I know it doesn't have the same space travel capabilities, but I'd recommend The Outer Worlds over this. It was such a good replayable game that really satisfies that outer space protagonist vibe- combat, dialogue, armors, weapons and skills all just feel good (quite the opposite of Starfield).",False,7,13131

While there are aspects of the game I did enjoy, starting with ship building through revamped engine and graphics, as well as the overall aesthetic, I just don't feel the urge to come back and finish the DLC.
Procedural generation simply has no place in Bethesda's lineup. You can feel it throughout entirety of the game: the same structures that you instantly recognize despite different planet or biome, same ""random"" ships encountered in space repeating the same damn comms, pointless terrain filler existing only so the POI can be spread out around an artificial square of generated terrain that is smoke and mirrors wannabe ""planet"". Quick glance at the map and you can instantly see SF doesn't even try to hide its shortcoming, ostentatiously slapping'em in your face like a hung d**k.

The only saving grace is when bases / POIs are part of a quest - it then feels like the classic Bethesda adventure you came to experience. And this is what they should've stuck with in the first place, instead of cloning pointless planets just for the sake of bragging rights.

It's hard to believe nearly 2 years have passed since release, and we've barely had one story DLC that I honestly didn't care to finish. And that is a sad state of the affair for a developer known for captivating stories and world building.

At 350 hours, I feel it would be unfair to say it's not worth buying. In the end, I've had some fun for what cannot be denied is a big chunk of time. But I don't recommend it at full price - wait for inevitable (summer, winter, Christmas, whatever) sales, and even then manage your expectations. Nuclear dose of suspension of disbelief is required to ignore the glaring problems this game has.

Starfield,1716740,192112105,"It's really not great, and it's definitely not worth 70 bucks. 

In a single sentence: Starfield feels like Mass Effect if it was made by Ned Flanders. 

In another: Starfield is an exercise in complete and utter mediocrity. 

Beyond the different quest lines, there is very little of interest. The time spent ""creating"" this massive universe should have been re-routed and put more into refining the combat, quests, and creating more interesting locations. Most planets have some semblance of procedural generation, yet they are generally barren, uninteresting, and not worth the time it takes to scroll through 4 menus to travel to, just to have to go into another menu to actually land on the planet. Points of interest repeat constantly and are generally copied and pasted. For instance, you will find a random named cavern on one planet, and find the exact same cavern on a completely different planet. Deviating from the quest lines WILL create a very boring experience, which is wild when you think about exploring other open-world RPGs made by Bethesda. 

Even then, some of the side quests are entirely there for padding. Do you like running around in an undercity where homeless people threaten to kill you with hammers while you try to flip 3 switches to figure out where the power drain is coming from? I don't.

Many quests also have some disgustingly long ""follow 'X'"" moments, and that's a major gaming sin with how bad Bethesda's NPC's pathfinding usually is. There have been many times where I had to reset to a previous save because an NPC got stuck on a railing and couldn't figure out how to....Step slightly to the left. 

There is a chunk of factions you can join as well, which all initially have pretty cool story lines, followed by extremely repetitive ""Go kill those pirates"" or ""go rescue those captives"" objectives. Sometimes they drop another interesting quest over time, but everything in between those quests is just really annoying padding. 

Starfield is incredibly too large and lacks substance. Take a fishbowl, for instance with the players as the fish. There is no water. There are a few pretty rocks (the quests). There is one dried out log propped against the wall (I'm not sure what this is, but fish tanks usually have one log propped against the wall.)

Anyway:

The whole ship system is clumsy and generally unsatisfying. Personally, I have stuck to buying or stealing better ships, because the ship builder is so poorly implemented that a recently lobotomized man would have a better time trying to build a functional helicopter. Many upgrades are also locked by arbitrary ""challenges"". You invest a skill point, only to have to turn around and train that skill anyway to be able to invest more skill points into it. Why even have the skill points? Just make it to where you can train specific skills and they auto-upgrade without the use of skill points. This creates a very unsatisfying dilemma because you WILL NOT be able to explore all aspects of character builds on a single playthrough, but I guess this was Bethesda's idea to try to keep players on the grind because the engagement/retention for this game is abysmal when compared to other Bethesda titles.

The base building is just depressing. Again, many things seem to be locked behind arbitrary skill point grinding followed by grinding even more to get to spend more skill points on the same skill. I personally wouldn't know, because the ""outposts"" are entirely optional, and you can buy/find literally any resource you need at vendors or corpses of pirates, religious zealots, and robots. 

This game has major pacing issues, as well. There's a lot of downtime when getting from point A to point B, and there isn't a ton of interesting or creative things happening in between. The most ""random"" event you will generally encounter is being threatened by a pirate, but even that just suddenly stops when you get into this groove of moving between the same 4 planets for 3 hours.

The campaign is boring, bland, and uninspired.
Fallout 4 is often criticized for its weak campaign and writing, right? Well, this game's writing makes Fallout's writing feel amazing.

The faction quests are also dull; there's nothing special about them. They feel like just another side quest, offering no sense of closure or accomplishment.

The decent quests (and that’s the best you’ll get) are few and far between.

In short, the game doesn’t offer anything more than a basic gameplay loop for those who already enjoy the Fallout formula. That means warping somewhere, killing all the enemies, and collecting random loot.

The constant loading of cells (interiors/planets) is worse here than in any other Bethesda game.

The Shattered Space DLC is not good at all.

The soundtrack is ok, but with the game it's just something you will ignore beside those big problems.

The Base building aspect is fucking garbage and a huge missed opportunity. There are literally thousands of items, objects, buildings, materials, and other assets in this game that could easily have been added to this system and made it a massive base building game, but instead we are limited to ~20 structure pieces & <200 furniture items, most of which are just different variations and near identical to each other.

The ship building aspect is far more satisfying than the base building aspect, but it is still very limited. Building ships is also extremely clunky because certain ship parts can only be attached at specific vendors.

The universe is boring and is just limited to a bunch of solar systems with a sun, gas planets, regular planets and moons. You'll never see anything cool like supernovas, black holes, neutron stars, pulsars etc.

The planets and moons you can visit are just boring procedurally generated surfaces with mostly nothing on them, and they completely lack any weather effects. Even planets in the Sol system lack familiar landmarks like the massive Olympus Mons mountain on Mars for example, and any ocean you find on the planets are only as deep as a puddle.

Space travel is unsatisfying (most due to loading screens).

Ship combat is unsatisfying and kinda boring.

The perk system is a good try but could use some polishing.

. Feels like its in beta; so many game breaking bugs.
. Lacks depth; REQUIRES mods for a good experience unfortunately.
. Paid Mods/Creations; only a small percentage of revenue goes to the mod creator, a total ripoff IMO.
. Repetitive Side-quests; other than the faction quests, the side missions are quite generic, mostly fetch/kill quests.
. Mid performance; It has certainly improved, but the game seems to still rely on up-scaling and frame generation :(.
. Mid Graphics, Mods are necessary to get great graphics, LUT mods and Texture Mods are my recommendations.

The reason i give this game a positive, is that although it is very beta feeling, it is still a fun game.
. Skyrim-like game-play set in a sci-fi universe.
. Enjoyable Faction Quests, honestly some of them are better than the main story-line quest.
. Interesting Lore, not as extensive as elder scrolls lore but was still fun to learn about the Starfield universe.
. Awesome city design, The city's could be bigger, but they appear to have been crafted with extensive detail.
. Many Different Skills and Character Builds.
. Character Customisation is acceptable, the possibilities for character creation are quite extensive but could be improved.

Starfield,1716740,191955197,"Starfield, Bethesda's ambitious space RPG, launched with sky-high expectations but landed somewhere between a stellar adventure and a buggy mess. It offers a vast universe to explore, with over 1,000 planets, a decent main story, and that classic Bethesda RPG feel—freedom to roleplay, craft, and build outposts. The ship customization is a standout, letting you design your own cosmic ride, and the visuals, especially in space, can be breathtaking.

Pros:

Huge, explorable universe with a sense of scale.
Solid ship-building and combat mechanics.
Engaging faction quests and companion stories.
Improved gunplay compared to past Bethesda titles.
Cons (and Bethesda’s Screw-Ups):

Loading screens galore—every building, planet transition, and fast travel feels like a momentum killer. Bethesda’s ancient Creation Engine chokes here, making the experience feel dated.
Empty planets—many of those 1,000 worlds are barren, with copy-paste outposts and little reason to explore.
Clunky UI and inventory management, a recurring Bethesda sin.
Bugs aplenty: NPCs floating, quests breaking, and performance stutters, even years after launch.
The writing and dialogue often feel stiff, lacking the charm of Fallout or Skyrim.
What Bethesda Fucked Up:

Beyond the excessive loading screens, they leaned too hard into quantity over quality—more planets doesn’t mean more fun if they’re lifeless. The engine’s limitations are glaring, with janky animations and dated tech holding back what could’ve been a next-gen leap. They also fumbled the pacing; the main story takes too long to hook you, and the exploration lacks meaningful rewards. It’s like they aimed for the stars but forgot to pack enough fuel.

Verdict: Starfield is a mixed bag—fun for fans of Bethesda’s formula, but it’s no Skyrim in space. It’s a 7/10 that could’ve been a 9 with polish and ambition better executed.",False,3,3259

I'm a huge fan of classic sci-fi movies, literature, and video games (Alien, Prometheus, Space Odyssey, Babylon-5, Life, Mass Effect, Prey, Dead Space, No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous), and from my experience, Starfield has a lot of connections with the mentioned titles. Although I confirm many negative aspects such as bugs and poor design choices (loading screens, repeatable environments, boring characters, you can unwear your spacesuit on Mars and it will lead to slow heat deterioration, WAT?), there are a lot of canonical sci-fi tropes and references to the mentioned foundations, interesting locations, stories, side quests, planet exploration, abandoned bases with mysterious histories, comfortable controls and UI, space physics, low-gravity physics, space colors, graphics, and so on.

Facial animations and the voice acting all seem AI generated. Not to mention procedural generation in quest for the majority of the planets. Its all fetch quest too. Claim it took 8 years of development but somehow Fallout New Vegas took 18 months and has more content? Starfield strait up feels like they asked AI to create a bethesda game.

Starfield,1716740,191870886,"This game is getting preposterously underrated.  

Look, we gotta stay in reality here.  There's plenty to grouse about if you're looking to complain, but this game's amazing.  There are downvote reviews in here with 150 hours of playtime in the game!  If you get two hours of playtime for every USD spent, you're getting your money's worth out of the game, okay?  No it will not solve all your problems, no it won't make you a perfect risotto, no it won't fight crime or solve mysteries, no it won't give your life meaning or purpose, no it won't bring her back.  

It's a video game, not a religious experience.  It's a tremendously fun video game with tons of things to do, including building a base or custom starship, getting into laser fights on an alien moon with space pirates, making a ton of (in-game!) food or mixed drinks or whatever, becoming a space sheriff, becoming a NOC Federation superspy and uncovering a horrifying conspiracy and / or running down alien wildlife in a dune buggy.  It's got a consistent through-line on a massive variety of recognizable sci-fi settings, from Star Wars to Aliens to 2001 to Gears of War to Cyberpunk to Firefly and more.  

There's certainly things to gripe about, but we gotta keep some perspective here.  I notice that the game is missing, say, custom dune buggy ramps for my outpost only because I got it into my head to fill my base with those and make a low-G Hotwheels track in the first place.  So, yes: it feels a bit sterile sometimes, they paid attention to some details (different switches thrown in different cockpits) over others (getting the **** weapons to align in the shipbuilder) and there haven't been that many ""whoa, THIS is cool"" pleasant surprises that earlier games in the series were so good at.  It feels built-by-committee a bit.  

But sheesh you guys, the game is huge and amazing.  It's got more gameplay than any Mass Effect or Star Wars game we've ever had and far, far, far more Firefly than we'll ever get :(  The price point burns, I know, but it's well worth it.

Starfield,1716740,191855683,"So I will preface this saying I genuinely like this game. 430 hours, all achievements, multiple new games plus runs, played the DLC at launch. This game scratched an itch that The Outer Worlds didn't. All of that said there are some serious issues I cannot get past for a full priced game. Warning there will be spoilers for the story.

 It's a Bethesda game, jank engine with issues that come with all Bethesda games. Crashes, texture issues, ect. 
Good story, missed execution. HERE COME SPOILERS. You pretty much start off like you do in all Bethesda games, start off as misc person, something goes wrong and you're thrown into the story make your characters background, ect. But the background you pic, especially each new game plus doesn't really impact your experience or change it especially as you hit NG+ and adjacent in levels and skill trees. The ideal for the multiverse to allow new game plus' I really like, but it isn't done all that well. Your choices font have a huge impact, from my time playing there really isn't any huge repercussions from being evil. Nor do you really feel anything or accomplished for completing what are passed as galactic changing events. As you go to another universe you're shown the ""results"" of what you have done in this one, but it just feels hollow regardless of what choice you've made, even the main antagonist the hunter seems to allude to that as he's very much, ""We're gods, we can do what we want in these universes and just hop to a new one"" Very early on you're introduced to the knowledge that the galaxy is still recovering from a very destructive war among the two main factions UC and Freestar but despite tensions still being high, the most you'll get is some weak jabs over dialogue, no real emphasis to show just how fragile the political climate between the factions is. The worlds feel empty, and yes i know, they're frontier worlds that aren't all inhabited, but every last structure is reused on the same world, occupied by the same factions. Exploration after a while just feels hollow and unrewarding. while the vehicles are nice, worlds with low gravity it is more practical just to use your jump pack to get around. Factions feel hollow as well. The vast majority of their quests can be boiled down to fetch quests and go here and clear this area, I thought I was done with the minutemen, but apparently another settlement needs my help, but this time in space. I will say the UC and Freestar stories are a lot better than the main story. A large portion of the main story is ""Go here there is an artifact here"" or ""Go here, there is a temple where you'll get cool space wizard powers"" but each time it's the same. No variety really how to get the artifacts other than a select few, and no reall variation between the temples. Just float around each time, collect shiney space lights then boom the rings aline and you get your new powers. Each new game plus if you want to collect all the powers legit you'll have to do it over again meaning to max out all powers to 10 you'll need to do over 200 temples over the NG+ you do considering how there are 20+ temples per run. It gets tedious after the first 10. Each home world to the faction also just feels like a missed oppertunity. They feel devoid of life despite the countless NPCs, but remarkably few have anything to really add other than being vendors and giving some insight to the world. The characters for the most part you meet are fun and interesting. Ship building is jank and fairly confusing at times, but ship combat is fun and fairly streamlined imo. Gunplay is fine for the most part. Settlement building is a massive backtrack from Fallout 4 and even Fallout 76. The armor and ship you get after starting a NG+ get out competed really quick in higher levels which is a shame because both the designs are cool, That feels like a misstep as in the main quest your follows say that the Starborn ships could blow you out of the sky. The DLC is a missed oppertunity as well. Why cant I take over house Varuun after literally becoming the chosen one to save their people. I'm literally already and universe hopping god with powers that can summon a supernova, I think I can run one planet of religious groat hearders. That's not a jab at House Varuun. They have by far the best clothing and coolest weapons in game lets be real here. But even the DLC just felt like the main story. Where it had a good idea that was done horribly. Finally the creations. This one bothers me the most out of anything. I'm all for supporting mod creators, they do great work and are a HUGE HUGE HUGE reason why Bethesda games are so long lasting for many of us, but stuff like the compendium categorizing resources, where to find them, ect should have been a quality of life update for the game, not a paid mod, that right there is a huge issue with the current micro-transaction issue in games, and Bethesda keeps adding new ways to squeeze money off of us. All started with horse armor in Oblivion, then Skyrim, then Skyrim, and then you guessed it Skyrim. You're better off looking on nexus for mods that improve the game or add features that should have been implemented prior and not paid. I know there is a lot of negative here, but with all that said I still enjoy this game, it's a Bethesda game with all of its faults and glory, but this is also one of the reasons I dont pre-order games anymore. I just cant support games that feel half finished in a lot of aspects that Bethesda has been cranking out over the last few releases. Everything they try and build suspense or tention for in Starfield just misses the mark and no real conflict happens that is meaningful. Most of the side quests outshine the main missions and exploration gets to be a chore where as in games like Skyrim it was amazing, All that said I both dont and do reccomend this game.

Starfield,1716740,191714296,"sci-fi is my favorite genre. this is without a doubt the least creative sci-fi project i have ever seen in my life. the world is so safe, so boring, and so uninspired i wonder why they even bothered putting time into making a game set in space in the first place. this is one of the only games of recent memory where Nothing Happens. it's a miracle to me that this is an M-rated game because it is like the Weenie Hut Jr's of game design on almost every aspect. want to have cool space battles with dog-fighting and capital ships? good thing that the only war in this universe took place 100 years ago. the world has stories all about great battles and hardships and discoveries that humanity went through, all of which are uninspired at best. the game takes place entirely during an era of peace. it is constantly reminding you of a better game that simply doesnt exist. multiple occasions the narrative presents you with a semblance of choice, and by the end of the quest you realize that the choice was already made for you. example: one of the pirate buccaneers veers you in on a scheme to kill the captain and you have the option to either ignore him or say no. no matter what you say by the end of the quest he will apologize to you and the fate of the captain was never even a dialogue you could have in the first place.
you are spawned into this world just in time to be everyone's best working class saint. there are no stakes in this world. every npc is either immediately kind to you or attacks you on sight. everything in this universe just works flawlessly. fuel is unlimited and humans can instantly teleport anywhere they want in the universe (yet they cant figure out how to send emails to each other). the weapons are horrific in their design, even worse than it was in fallout 4, they are bulky and uninspired and totally unsatisfying to wield. every character has really awkward face animations with glistening eyeballs that stare you down during every dialogue conversation (im definitely looking forward to that in elder scrolls 6). also the persuade and lockpicking minigames are just .... complete downgrade from what came before

i tried for 200 hours (with mods) to find something that at least resembled substance and i came up with ship building. it's fun to snap spaceship parts together like legos, however even that has so many hard-coded limitations on it that it just completely ruins the experience of any kind of creativity you could have. you cant rotate modules, you cant have more than one shield/reactor/landing bay even if its just visually. every hab space is just a square, making any and all ship builds at least visually similar. not to mention that it is just not fun or engaging or immersive to fly your ship in orbit or even fundamentally use your ship at all. the ship builder has such little reason to exist, and no reason at all to be so held back mechanically.

i also have had this amazing bug where if i enter a menu, ie. inventory, pause menu, even ship building menu, the game will stop using my gpu altogether, the game will run at 5 fps until i either spam escape or if that doesnt work (usually doesnt), completely close out the game and restart. it was this way at launch and has been that way since. its the only bethesda game ever to do this.

even by bethesda's standards, which is miles under the ground, this game is the most soul-crushing and mind numbing thing that they have ever put out. i bought this game as a joke because i went in with expectations so low that there was no way i wouldnt get at least an absurd kind of entertainment out of it. and it somehow found a way to be even worse than i was expecting. which is, in fact, as absurd as it is hilarious to me.

for fallout fans, imagine if the infamous confrontation with colonel autumn in fallout 3 was stretched out to an entire open world video game. except this time, there is no gore or vats or other-worldly whimsy and charm or climactic moments to keep you entertained on even a surface level. i guess if you wanted a game where you can go around and collect sandwiches to fill your prebuilt spaceship bedroom with 1000 physically based sandwich models, and find a lot of entertainment and escapism in that fantasy, then this game might just be your game of the year. for the rest of us we will be looking out for a space rpg that is interesting, engaging, and above all the least creative enough to warrant its own existence",False,8,11956
Starfield,1716740,191703116,"Starfield might be a game for you. It has a good amount going for it, and most of the reasons that made the game a train wreck at launch have been resolved. That said, some of the game is still lack luster.

Reasons you might like Starfield:
1. Sandbox galaxy
2. Original story for the genre
3. Several factions of optional content
4. Solid on world physics
5. On world based combat is fun
6. Combat and non-combat options frequently available
7. Combat and combat related skills are fun and interesting
8. Decent ship building

Reasons you might NOT like Starfield:
1. Outpost (base building) system is painful and pointless
2. Some skills are pointless
3. Visibility can be frustrating and challenging
4. Poor outer space physics
5. Outer space combat is mid

What I enjoyed most about Starfield was the ability to get in my ship and go anywhere. Like The Elder Scrolls (e.g., Skyrim) before it, you can play whatever content you want basically whenever you want. I would even go so far as to say that you don't even have to play the main storyline to have fun. You could skip it. Though the story has a good amount of originality to it and is worth playing. The combat on normal difficulty is no more than casual in actual challenge, but you can ramp the difficulty up to a moderate level of challenge. Starfield is a reasonably fun TES game in space.

The ship building in game isn't for everyone, but it is also entirely optional. If you are interested in building your own ship, the system is quite capable. There is quite a following of people designing ships after famous SciFi movies. And you, too, can create something that looks cool and is practical for the game. I generally enjoyed building my own ships, but I wish that all ship components could be acquired to install at your own spaceship builder instead of having to travel to many locations to have components installed.

What I was most disappointed in Starfield was for the absurdly poor outpost system. I wasn't expecting Satisfactory level outpost building and resource management, but what it did deliver is convoluted and lacking core features. You can spend tons of your skill points in anything from Surveying to Outpost Engineering, Planetary Habitation to Outpost Management. All of it is an absolute waste. If you just go to the appropriate store to purchase resources needed to upgrade any gear you want (given you even decide to invest points into any crafting/upgrade skill), you can probably earn all the money required and acquire all the resources in minutes of game play. Those minutes completely eliminate any need for any outpost skill or the time it takes setting everything up. If you can even figure it out. One of the most rare Steam achievements for the game has to do with setting up resource links between planets (~2% of players last I checked). And even if you take the time to figure it out and set it up, there is almost zero method for organizing the output of the links. Minecraft's redstone systems are easier to design and better capable to organize your resources. And potentially even worse yet, the only base buildings you can build are all prefabs. If the only reason you want to play Starfield is to build bases and gather resources, hard pass on this game. If you are ok hard passing on this feature of the game, you will probably find the rest of the enjoyable.

My biggest gripe with Starfield is the terrible visibility throughout the game. Worlds with decent vegetation at night, almost all caves, and many abandoned indoor structures have poor visibility. And the only tool you have to deal with it is a flashlight that seems like it is powered by a candle. The tech level of the game includes AIs, gene-splicing, giant mechs, and faster than light travel. But you cannot even acquire a low-light vision mod for your helmet. It's a travesty. It's manageable, but it is a serious pain to either manage the game's brightness manually in different environments or just deal with some aspect of the game being less than ideal (either too dark or too bright depending on what settings you leave static).

Combat in outer space could be anywhere on the spectrum of great fun to nerd rage, depending on what your expectations are. Essentially, if you are looking for ship-based combat to make use of cool combat tricks that can only be done in low to no gravity environments, then ship combat will be a turn off for you. If you prefer to just feel like driving a car in space and blow up some pirates, yeehaw! You'll have plenty of fun.

Starfield has some good draws to play it in 2025. It's come a long was since launch. It doesn't completely live up to its elder sibbling games (The Elder Scrolls), but it has enough in common with them that you could get hours of enjoyment out of the game.",True,1,24283
Starfield,1716740,191700058,"I like the game I just don't like all the glitches you get most of the way through a quest and you cant finish some wont even let you start. I must ask how is it that every planet you land on has all the same features if you have been on one you have been one them all  when you land on earth in a spot that should be sand like the sahara and it is the same the mount Everest, That takes the fun out of exploring you did so good on skyrim and fucked this one up please do better and make some fixes.",False,0,16421

Fast travel here, talk to this dude, fast travel here kill this dude, fast travel back and talk to guy, quest complete. I even installed some of the few mods this game offers from the nexus and it still sucked. Wouldn't recommend, i highly regret buying the ultimate edition and giving it too much of a chance to surprise me that now i cannot refund it.",False,1,271
Starfield,1716740,191694251,"the only bethesda game with a new game plus, but its the least replayable game they have made. they did manage to make using meta knowledge part of the game. there is a lot of neat stuff in this game but it just tries too hard to be everything instead of working to be great at some things. i played 5 hours at release and put it down for a year and a half, i expected better after they had time to fix things.

the enemies don't scale with you so once you can beat them nothing is a challenge anymore, except the occasional clone you fight. honestly if you get lucky with your first couple gun pick ups you're set for the rest of the game, like i got a revolver on the second planet i went after the tutorial and put a binary trigger on it. it can dump 6 overpowered shots in half a second which on extreme settings was still overkill for a terrormorph which is supposed to be a big enough threat to overwhelm whole settlements, but my asthmatic character didn't even break sprint taking down three of them. 

the outpost system is kind of neat you can collect resources to make outposts to collect more resources and sell them if you want to take the time to load them all up and take them somewhere, if they even have enough money to buy a cargo load of resources. you can skip this whole part of the game and not miss out on anything, even if you do defending them is near impossible because you're limited to 6 turrets and 6 robots. so if you get attacked on a side you didn't put a turret the wave of ecliptic that attack can overhwhelm all your robots and destroy your place with little to no effort. building ships or outposts the clicking together of pieces is just painful. base game doesn't have a base/leveling option for outposts so you have to build stuff around the terrain that doesn't look as nice as it could. i've spent 10 minutes trying to stack a resource container because it glitched down a level or was half off the side and could not get it to go right. 

i was lucky about glitches and bugs in the game besides a couple locks i got that were fixed by reloading a save a couple minutes back, i only had one bug that i had to google how to fix and it was sleep for 24 hours to make the npc load. i even checked with console it just would not let him load anywhere. i have a friend that has had multiple game breaking bugs happen. 

mods disable achievements, even official mods from the creation club. which is really just dumb especially for a bethesda games, it discourages some people from trying a really fun option to add content and fixes to the game. these games are only kept alive by they modding community adding content and fixing the game because the developer won't. 

there is no real lock out from one faction to the other, you can still be top of everything with 5 or 6 missions. you just gain more things to use in conversations to convince people. sneaking is so so, there are some fun stealth missions though once you are done with them there is no point in running through vents again. 

i thought the buggy would be more fun, or a faster way to move around, it just isn't for me. nothing is flat enough for it to be much use, the boost is so low it doesn't help much in 1 or more gravity. its faster for me to use food and drugs to recover oxygen and run around the map. then sometimes when i'm landed it just glitches under my ship and makes everything vibrate constantly, like my controller rumbles all over new atlantis. you can't disable it after you buy it, they only ever put in the one vehicle no upgrades or changes besides painting. the one upside is sometimes it gets partially caught under my ship and launches out fast at an unpredictable angle, so its launched the ship services guy into orbit a few times which is always funny. 

powers are underwhelming, even without the ""puzzle"" of flying into the bright lights until the rings unlock and let you get them. that's neat the first time, then tedious after that. worst part is if you don't go far enough in one questline you can play most of the game without ever even knowing they are in the game. i think i played 120 hours without unlocking them, then barely used them after because all of them were less effective than items, they didn't offer a tactical advantage over just shooting enemies they just kind of were a thing to collect. 

new game plus is really not that great. you just get to keep powers, research, and your experience points/level. you just wind up doing the exact same thing all over again with a new option in most conversations, ""trust me i already did this"" type stuff. you lose all your items, your ships, your artifacts, your outposts, your progress in any missions. an hour into a new playthrough, i made a powered up assault rifle and food/drinks/drugs that all boosted speed and was able to just sprint through all the science outposts and what not too fast for the ai to keep up, get to the end and fast travel out. right after starting the only thing that slows me down is not having digipicks for the locked doors even on max difficulty which really just makes enemies more spongy and you weaker. the game is super grindy for no pay off, because when you get to the end all your work is erased so you can start over. 

i'm leaving my expectations for this out because i was looking forward to it at launch and thought it was bad enough i just set it aside for a year and a half to play now. i won't even go into how pissed off i am that they delayed elderscrolls 6 for this. there is so much potential here, but it falls on its face trying to do everything. it feels like 3 or 4 games jammed together last second. i think it would have been an amazing game if they had scrapped the outpost thing beyond maybe a place to hide out once in a while and stash stolen cargo or something, and not had the newgame plus/main quest part of the game. so if they put in a couple bases you could clear out and claim, then focused on quality of missions and world building so you don't wind up raiding the same lost science outpost 3 times with the same notes and everything, i'd have enjoyed this more. when i was just dinking around helping security on misssions, then flying around doing new stuff on different worlds i had fun, then it just looped content to add more time or something and it sucked.",False,3,8291

  Sigh... I really want to say good things about this game, but I can't ignore the fact that this game is FILLED with broken/buggy quests that can't be finished because of the bugs. Misspellings in dialogue, a HUGE area (entire star systems) that has absolutely NOTHING going on in it, Some of the worst lag I have EVER encountered in a video game (and it's a SINGLE PLAYER GAME!), game crashes, numerous incomplete features, NPC character models that are janky and outdated, idiot dialogue from characters that are supposed to be intelligent (like your supposedly intelligent professor father calling a .45 automatic a ""Revolver""), and the list goes on and on. The BEST thing about this game is that it can be modded, and with mods it's AMAZING, BUT you cannot gain achievements with mods running. The ONE expansion is a flop and a ripoff of the series ""The Expanse"" (Shame on you Bethesda!),
  ^^ BETHESDA! FIX THIS! PLEASE! ^^

I took a LONG break from this game and returned to find... NOTHING has been improved by Bethesda!
Bethesda has abandoned Starfield, and other than a new EULA, there have been no improvements, expansions, DLC or ANYTHING significant added to the game since the one poop filled expansion they released last year.

The ONLY reason to play Starfield is because of the Modders, and Bethesda blocks achievements if you use Mods. Oh Wait, Bethesda CHARGES MONEY for players to get achievements with SOME Mods. 
 Garbage Strategy Bethesda!

I'm an OLD School Gamer. One of the Original supporters of this industry, and these COMPANIES are making me regret all of the time I have spent supporting this industry.
     Rant Over... it doesn't really matter, because Who Cares?

   Finally, I want to say THANK YOU to ALL of the Mod Authors that make this game Playable! You Guys Rock!
 It's too bad your efforts aren't supported or appreciated by the COMPANIES that profit from your work.

I feel that they got overconfident; they have a lot of experience building on the lore of Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect, but creating something entirely new is daunting: you need to draw players in with a huge amount of (ambiguous) lore, mysteries, and open endings that provide your basis to grow, but the game feels like they underestimated that and in the end, just gave up halfway through.

I realized something horrible: I didn't want to play Starfield anymore.  I had seen the whole Bethesda-crafted universe: There was nothing left to see.  Just more procedural generated planets, more dogfights, more walking aimlessly around massive planets with nothing on them worth seeing.

I'm sorry that it took me 45 hours to realize how bad this game was.  I'm sorry I let myself get so excited for it.  I'm sorry I preordered it.  I'm sorry I defended it so fervently.

Perhaps we should've seen Starfield as a warning of what the Internet as a whole was going to look like not far in the future.  The soul taken out of something everyone loved because it was soulful, the open-world RPG.  And what is left?  A universe of AI-generated slop.  Or in this case, procedurally generated.  What were they thinking?

Bethesda understands that people like space, but they apparently didn't have a clue why people liked space fantasy stories.  Space fantasy stories are fun because they expand world and tech nearly endlessly.  People like space fantasies where humanity and/or other species are spread across the stars, and have built their own new civilizations, cultures, etc.  People love that.

Starfield offers a universe so empty and hallow that it fills me with a certain dread and sadness to play.  Far from encouraging the imagination or wonder the game developers wanted, this world is not one I would ever want to live in.  But I wouldn't want to live in Tamriel, or the Wasteland either.  The difference?  Tamriel, and the Wasteland are interesting.  In the sands of Elsweyr or the Mojave, we find a world worth exploring.  In Starfield's numerous moons, what do we find?  Lonely, cosmic space dust.  If it could speak, it would scream, for it knows no friends, no stories to tell.

5/10 combat's good",False,12,2921
Starfield,1716740,191531801,"97 hours played, I've beaten the DLC and made it to what I think is the end of Act 1 of the main story before taking a break. Bethesda's games are some of my most played by far in terms of hours both on and off PC. The reviews you may have heard that say 'it gets good after 12 hours' and 'if you just want a simple Bethesda experience, you'll like it' are somewhat accurate, but I'd like to add to it. This game is pretty frustrating in how it has good ideas in it that push beyond the Skyrim baseline but it's always undercut by the much higher percentage of still-present weaknesses made more painful by the measures taken to bloat your playtime. The effect is that a given play session is a repetitive drag with spikes of 'oh i want more of that', which is my experience with the game as whole.

The new Persuasion system is great, but the massive Perk system for getting basic gameplay features (like a stealth bar, a ship targeting feature, pickpocketing, and most crafting) an hour+ at a time is absurd.  What they do to make the lives of your companions important in the story was PERFECT for adding stakes, but the fact that your only four in-depth/romanceable companions are all within the same faction and mostly have the same exact Likes/Dislikes is baffling.  Your perks, background and previous statements are often remembered in conversation, but they never have an impact on the outcome. The ability to knock someone unconscious is equally underutilized and is essentially never acknowledged as an option in quests. It's a shame, because I find these very cool mechanics. Same goes for Grav Jumping out of combat, which is very thrilling when it works (though it takes a while to figure out when it does.)

Since most of your playtime is spent going from place to place and shooting stuff, what you see is a bigger consideration than usual. I often chose to switch up perspectives and use in-world Grav Jumping instead of fast travelling from the out-of-universe menu exclusively, even though it's always an option. The 3rd Person Idle stance for pistols is sweet, but the shooting and the 1st Person anims are all the same boring ones from Fallout 4. The animations when you physically interact with your ship's console are AMAZING for immersion, but they're few, short, and the exception instead of the rule with the world's technology. There are also too few ship animations to make up for the sheer number of fast traveling you need to do, leading me to feel like I know the same 5 or 6 take-off/landing/flying scenes like the back of my hand.

The best quest I've played was a crime investigation in the DLC, where you can interact with a computer and use some problem-solving with few hints to offer up additional evidence that can help prosecute a criminal. Even though your reward is functionally only a couple extra lines of dialogue in the confrontation, it was still a great breath of fresh air from the hundreds of other completely rigid quests that surround it. The same goes for the UC Vanguard and Freestar Rangers quests, where you have to make a relatively nuanced decision at the end that offers some satisfaction in role-playing, but lacks much consequence one way or the other in the overall factions (aside from the same four people in Constellation lining up to congratulate/berate you in the same way).

Clearly, I don't think creating a deep RPG or even a simple adventure game as iconic as Skyrim or Fallout 3 was what Bethesda actually developed. What I think they made was a space adventure template with a ton of potential for a future team to actualize. All of the complaints I made can be easily fixed with different writing and a direction that aims to make the most out of the systems already here instead of trying to add in as many things as possible. Though it's likely impossible, I would love for a New Vegas-style game where different directors/writers take what's been made and use it as a skeleton for a more decision-heavy action RPG ( with more cool animations and less time spent fast travelling in menus :) ).",False,3,5856

Now, about the game itself—calling it an ""open galaxy"" experience is an understatement. I have over 100+ hours in, and I still haven’t explored all the galaxies, let alone the countless planets within them. The shooting mechanics are incredibly fun, and your interactions with your companions change depending on your choices, making every playthrough feel unique.

As a longtime Elder Scrolls fan, I can confidently say that Starfield surpasses it for me. The sheer scale of exploration, the endless side quests, and the ability to have a companion in combat make it an unforgettable experience.

Starfield,1716740,191487170,"I feel that the main problem that people have with this game is that we were basically promised ""Skyrim in space"" and got this game. Is it ""Skyrim in space""? No. If you stop looking at the game through the lens of I need the excitement that the mods of Skyrim gave to Skyrim then it is a perfectly fun game. The main story is approximately the same length as the main story in Skyrim, there are less side quests than there were in base Skyrim, and it can get tedious to travel to different systems just to land on a planet that may or may not have more than just one building on it. However, saying that it is a bad game is a stretch. The side quests are, in most cases, just as fun as the ones in Skyrim. The ""space magic"" is a bit weak, even when maxed out, but used strategically is at the same time completely overpowered.

Why did modders abandon the game? I don't know, I rarely modded Skyrim and have approximately 750 hours in the base and special edition versions of the game combined (I know that is rookie numbers but I don't have the time that I used to to keep playing). As someone who rarely mods games, this game is almost the same quality as Skyrim (I know that it sounds like heresy to say but I said it), which has about the same amount of places to go as this game, just on a smaller map. Should Bethesda continue to add more to the base game which has a lot of empty planets? Yes, it doesn't have to be Skyrim levels of content density per planet but at least 10 locations to be able to find ""easily"" on each planet would be an extreme upgrade and I feel would assuage the annoyance of those that felt that they were robbed of a ""Skyrim in space"" game.

This review got a lot longer than intended. Overall, I recommend the game, as long as you buy it on sale (I got Skyrim on sale and was very happy with it) and keep yourself from comparing the game to Skyrim too much (in spite of how much I did so in this review). This game is not ""Skyrim in space"" it is similar to how it is titled, a field of stars to explore (although lots of them have very little on each planet). That is exactly what exploration really is, most of the time it is a lot of finding nothing, and only sometimes you find something interesting. That may be part of the reason why you have to join the SPACE EXPLORERS to progress the main story. The main thing for you to do in the game is, unsurprisingly, explore space.",True,0,20821
Starfield,1716740,191476557,"Apologise for all gramatic mistakes
This game will be probably consider amazing 20 or 25 years ago. But today this game is terrible.

Story is terrible and I cannot even remember what the hell is going on. Only basically getting artifacts and basically getting into new universe, telling people I am from different universe and their reaction was basically: wooow, anyway go grab same artifacts like in previous universe again, goodbye.

Whole story is again based around main character... it is combination of Skyrim and Fallout 4. Skyrim in sense of collecting magically shouts or how they are called and only difference to get max level of those in starfield is you need to each upgrade 10 times... 24 shouts... each 10 TIMES. And Fallout 4 in sense of gun upgrades and base building (and bad story).

Only enjoyable and little bit memorable sections for me been few faction questlines. And those are terrible too. Lots of stupid decisions and missed opportunites.
3 examples:
UC questiline was enjoyable, but why in the f**k you name creature Terrormorph, which basically telling us in name what those creature doing and ""massive"" twist of this questline is little bit ruined. ANd few stupid things on this timeline like: how this person manage to do that from that place.
Freestar rangers has massive fall down when you talk with just character and you immidietly say for yourself ""he is bad guy"" and than you go through whole line to basically get from ""miniboss"" information about that same guy. And worst, that ""miniboss"" is in hangar full of mechs and you expecting some form of bossfight again mech and no mech bossfight in the end to get enique dungeon. Just kill mercenaries and than ""miniboss"", than ""miniboss"" tell you info and finally properly kill him.
Or corporate work for company which i don´t remember name. You starting with quest to bring coffee and meet ex employee and you kill him or convice him and that somehow promote you from completely new employe to somebody who will do serious of stealth missions.

But other than that.. this game is terrible.

Gun customisation is ok i guess.

Ship customisation is so limited and to unlock everything you need few perks and be level 60 to have full acess to it. And you want to build your ship after that and decide to go to ship technician... well you are limited, because ship technicians have only access to specific parts.

And if you do Doom creation thing... you will get probably most overpowered suit in game based on statistic (and if i remember everyboy have acess to it for free). Same goes for sniper rifle form one Creation. For both of those I did not had any reasons to use anything else... only reason why i did use something else than sniper rifle was when i been out of ammo.

I will not give review for DLC separately, because even if i finish it I have no idea what the hell was story and i paid attention whole time.

Bethesda need to get better writters, use better documentation and better engine for next game.

I was idiot buying this game in Digital Premium Edition... this game is not worth it for 99,99 euros for that edition. Not even for 69,99 euros for base game. This game should be 25 euros max.

the gun play felt very fallout to me and very outdated the constant load screen after load screen especially after playing Marvels Spider-man 2 drove me crazy if this was 2010 it wouldn't have bothered me as much. The dog fights in space were pretty fun but got stale 

CC / shipbuilder 7/10 

Granted the cc felt limited but the fact that i could give my characters parents an house at the start was very interesting i give them props for that imo it made for great immersion, the shipbuilding was this games saving grace the fact i could make ships from beloved movies like Star Wars and games like Mass Effect made me happy.

Companions / Exploration / Story 5/10

Alot of the companions  lacked emotions the romance was dull as hell exploring the world became super repetitive because after a while every cave looked the same every world looked the same with different colors , HAVING NO ALIENS WAS A CRIME in itself and yes i'm talking intelligent alien species like building a friendship with them instead they gave us a aggressive monster. Everyone being a human sucked ass , story is pretty meh for the most part but i will say the UC vs Pirates quest line was fun as hell other that the story falls flat in alot of places 

Overall 6/10

Starfield is a decent game if this was 2010 it would be GOTY but sadly we in the 2020s and Bethesda needs to get with the times because this game is very dated after i clear my backlog of games i will finish it and maybe update but so far not impressed

Starfield,1716740,191335119,"I have been a die-hard fan of Bethesda ever since I was a child playing Morrowing, Oblivion, and Fallout 3. However, it's safe for me to say I have lost all faith in them as a company. They've lost touch with what made them great.

With that being said, Starfield is by far the worst Bethesda game I have ever played, and that's saying a lot since.. well you know.. Fallout 76 is a thing. 

Where to even begin.. It's riddled with bugs, more than your average Bethesda game to where it isn't cute anymore. 

The world building is sloppy, lazy, and BORING. Main cities are lack-luster and tiny, hardly anything to explore after the first 10 minutes of landing — and that's the populated areas of the game. They feel like cardboard cutout facades to mimic it's great size, but once you're in it you can feel it. Don't even get me started on how utterly sad the other planets and moons are, they're floating balls of nothingness with maybe a settlement or two, if you're lucky, dotted around. After a few hours into the game you'll notice they're the same buildings just copy and pasted here and there.

The story and overall writing is ABYSMAL! The main story is a watered down version of Skyrim's dragonborn (but in space oooo) with none of the likable characters. None of the NPCs have any comprehensive dialog or meaningful backgrounds to them so there is zero reason to get attached to any of them. Previous Bethesda games at least had the help of foundational material to work off from (and maybe better writers at the time?), but since this is their own fresh title, it really shows how lacking they are to create a story that promotes any emotional response from the player. Genuinely feels like it was written by AI and then hardly skimmed over for mistakes. No love, no passion, just dead empty eyes in their flat forgetful characters. Apart from that are the side quests, and they mainly consist of fetch-quests that make you run around in the empty nothingness that is Starfield's universe.

The weapons are rubbery and flat, there's no weight to them and you have to unload mag after mag to kill one guy. They made huge progress with guns in Fallout 4 but somehow made them worse again for this title? It's like fighting with nerf darts. Apart from that, there is also significantly less ways for you to customize your weapons to really make them yours. There ends up being more ballistic guns than any other type of weapon combined in the game, so much for variety. And if you think you can get around this with making a melee character, think again because there are only 8-9 different melee weapon options. Their damage is so poor you might at well fight space pirates off with a butter knife.

Settlement building is pointless, there's no reason to have a stationary base when you have one that flies around with you. The few perks to having a planetary base are not worth the grind to get to. And is also yet another feature that was somehow downgraded from Fallout 4, more clunky, harder to build with, etc.

The one saving grace for this game is the ship builder. I'll admit, out of everything, this game is a really fun spaceship builder. Especially if you get mods that allow you to be more free with the construction.

All in all I would highly not recommend, wait for the next Bethesda title. And even then I'd be very cautious and never never ever preorder one of their games again.",False,268,4818
Starfield,1716740,191330865,"After a couple hundred hours, I am prepared to carefully endorse this game.  I have enjoyed my time with it, but you need to know a few things going in.

1.  You will need to expect standard Bugthesda glitches.  Most of them can be ignored.  For those that cannot...

2.  You will need a working knowledge of the console commands, and how to use them to fix broken quests, and fix NPC's that are stuck with bad pathfinding.  Other issues will come up, but there is community that has a lot of experience documenting bugs, and possible solutions.  Reddit will have most of the answers.

3.  For an optimal experience, you will need to use mods to correct certain silly game balance decisions, and improve the otherwise passable asthetics of this game.  I recommend the Vortex modding engine, and Nexus Mods for an excellent collection of community created content.

4.  This plays a lot like Skyrim In Space.  You can be an interstellar murder hobo if you want to be.

5.  Ignore the real world commentary about this game.  Play it because it looks like something you would enjoy, or don't.  

6.  Ship building is a lot of fun, but full access to that content is a late game feature that requires a lot of resources, and several levels and skill points to fully unlock.  

7.  There is no reverse pickpocketing, which was very disappointing to me.  (No Shady Sands Shuffle for you.)  At the time of this comment, there is no mod to correct this. (Boo!)

8.  Get it on sale, if possible.  Bugthesda needs encouragement to stop taking their fan base for granted, and paying full price is the wrong message to send.  All of the big game companies are guilty of this, but it has felt particularly egregious lately with this company.

9.  Do not spend a lot of effort in putting together your bases/ship fleet on your first playthrough.

I do find some of the buttons annoying especially when using ship inventory, the E key is used to interact with everything except inventory, it’s take item, and you use R to open the inventory, really need to be able to flip that.

Starfield,1716740,191249188,"I understand why some players feel disappointed with Starfield. That said, I personally don’t mind it. I avoided the pre-release hype, having only seen a single screenshot—and perhaps that worked in my favor. After logging 242 hours (at the time of writing), here are my thoughts, spoiler-free.

My Bethesda journey began with Morrowind, a game that captured my imagination in ways no other Elder Scrolls or Fallout title has since. To my surprise, Starfield manages to rekindle some of that magic. I can’t quite pinpoint why, but it draws me in with its charm. For me, it’s a refreshing dive into space exploration, grounded in Bethesda storytelling.

The story, while engaging enough to see through to completion, often felt like the experience of a space archaeologist—uncovering ancient artifacts without the thrill of dynamic twists or unexpected developments. It may not be particularly exciting, but it holds enough intrigue to keep you moving forward.

Crafting is a feature I thoroughly enjoyed. It’s simple and intuitive, making it accessible to players of all experience levels. That said, I couldn’t help but wish for a feature similar to Diablo 4’s, where item modifiers could be ‘disenchanted’ and reapplied to other gear for greater customization.

Ship construction, gunplay, and space combat are standout features, adding depth and variety to the gameplay. However, from a melee perspective, I couldn’t help but feel the absence of stealth takedown animations—a touch that would have added even more immersion to these encounters.

Base building offers creativity but has room for improvement. My primary issue is the lack of a toggleable grid, which would allow for precise infrastructure alignment. Adding such a feature would elevate the entire experience to a new level.

Planetary exploration remains a mixed bag. While the ""Shattered Space"" expansion marks a step in the right direction, too many planets feel barren and empty. I understand what Bethesda was trying to achieve, but, stunning vistas can only carry the appeal so far. I wasn’t keen on empty planetary exploration in Mass Effect back in 2007, and my opinion hasn’t changed in 2023—or 2025 at the time of writing. That said, the addition of a post-launch rover has made traversing these desolate tiles significantly more bearable.

Ultimately, my relationship with Starfield is a blend of appreciation and critique. On one hand, I see the flaws that others point out. On the other, I can’t deny the game’s charm, brought to life through great companions and a universe that keeps pulling me back in. If someone were to ask me whether I’d recommend Starfield, I absolutely would—provided they understand it’s not Fallout or Elder Scrolls. Starfield is Starfield, and I truly hope Bethesda continues to support and expand upon its foundations.",True,15,14639

i believe a casual player will still get their moneys worth of this type of game in you like bethesda games.
at least until you finish the main story. for me after leveling  up and whatnot what kept me going was speedrunning the game. i think starfield shows bethesda is working on having better base story for their games. but starfield in general has lack of general atmopshere as basically you get hit by a loading zone pretty much for everything unlike say skyrim lol.

its semi-procedual generation (some pois are different every run but MAJOR pois associated to the story are always in the same location so for speedruns if u know where the pixel is on the planet you can land there early.) overall its a fun experience to explore a few times but casually im done once ive beaten the quests/faction missions.

overall i got like 40hours in casually before i started speedrunning and another 10 fully beating the dlc.  the actual  game movement is very fun. i have now over 600 hours into the game and 500+ of that is just trying to break the game to go fast.

there is a LOT to this game that are small positives! and i mean a LOOOOOOOT
but the pure and simple truth is that it doesnt matter how many small pro's you have when you have the 2 MOST negative cons a game can have!
but as per usual i will list the pros and then the cons!

PROS
- the story doesnt take itself too serious but theres enough to do and learn about the settled systems that its just right for a no lifer (such as myself) or the causal gamer! 
- the skills arent overwhelmingly complicated and there are enoug of them that you can really get a playstyle going on as you work your way up to max level wherein you unlock all the skills! and the challenges required to be able to level up skills kind of synergize with exploration of the games many facets of immersion!
-even without modded content the game actually has really decent visuals despite some critical opinions on the front! there are a few places that are very bland but for the most part you can really enjoy the graphical design as long as you have the hardware to handle running the game at untlra settings!
-the game setting/environment is actually much larger than you would expect if you read the reivews of other people! granted there are a LOT of repetitions to be found but they play out in a way that doesnt make you hate it unless youre grinding for something! (DEVS NEED TO WORK ON THE CIVILIAN OUTPOSTS! NO REASON FOR THEM TO BE SO RARE!)
there are a few other minor pros i could list but they are trivial things that most wouldnt notice!

now for the cons! and i will only list 3. 2 are MASSIVELY impactful and 1 is just evidence of starfield either being rushed because of fan pressure or, evidence the game is just a cash grab! ill let you all decide
CONS
(in order from least bad to WTF Bethesda!)

WAY TOO MANY LOADING SCREENS!
you wouldnt think it matters all that much but they are not only ENTIRELY too frequent but they take an absurdly long time! mind you i have a very powerful computer! i can play 2 games at the same time, stream and have netflix running on my 3rd monitor while im watching a friends stream his game! and i have no frame drops on either game and perfect 60fps at 1080p on my stream and the one im watching! but this point is going to lead into the next CON i will list!

ABSOLUTE TRASH FIRE PROM NIGHT DUMPSTER BABY OPTIMIZATION!
ive quite seriously NEVER seen a game done this poorly! even without mods the game has micro stuttering when accessing a map mesh that is a sub mesh of another map! the more loading screens you have to access to get to a particular area of a map for a quest the more frequent and longer the stutters hang! the game crashes CONSTANTLY when going from one system to another or landing on a planet or just leaving the ship building menu.. sometimes it just crashes becuase it feels like it! how pathetic of a job are your devs allowed to do before you reprimand them publicly and fire people for poor performance at said job!? you guys (Bethesda's project leaders for Starfield) should be absolutely embarassed of yourselves for this! ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC! 

The game was supposed to be ""a modders paradise!"" but really its just a trashfire complicated process that deters people from modding from 1 update to the next!
and what make that statement even worse 2 facts that just make it not even worth wanting to really dive into all that starfield has to offer!
-the devs update the game version cuasing a LOAD of mods to break for an update that very seldom does anything to improve the game in anyway!
-they dont release a dev kit library change list that logs what exactly was changed within the engine itself! so most mods end up having to be re-written from scratch to be updated!
this wouldnt be a problem if they learned from the hard work the modders put in fixing and adding content the really brings Starfield to life! but they dont do that and they work with the content creators of said mods to incorporate their work into the game!

overall i would suggest leaving this game alone until Bethesda finally abandons it and the content creators can get the final version so that they can fix all the trash that has been vomitted out! 
there is so much potential in this game that it breaks my heart to have to call out bethesda like this! as i have never really fired shots at them like this but man they really SH*t the bed and used the pillow case to wipe with this one! 
i truly hope that they dont make the same mistake with the next entry in the Elder scrolls game or it WILL spell the end of Bethesda as we know it! you can have to titles this big fail this hard back to back!",False,1,6227
Starfield,1716740,191077753,"I think most of the complaints for this game are unfounded. I do think generally that Starfield, as a new IP, is not yet the legend that Morrowind, or Oblivion were for me. However, if this is game one in another potentially 5 game long saga, then I'm here for it. Bear in mind, that Morrowind was game 3... and Oblivion was game 4. How many of you even played Elderscrolls 1?!

Starfield as a universe is in fact loaded to bear. True, they skimped on 'POI's' and if you play the game long enough, you will see the same places. Is it lazy? with a game this size, who is to say. The characters are interesting, it just takes a couple of anomalous trips through the unity to fully tease those depths out, and I'm guessing by most reviewers hours played, they have not experienced more than one at most.

Initially, I was turned off by their NG+ system. In a game where you can create settlements, or perfect your starship it hurt quite a bit to leave it all behind to start from scratch once more. Nevertheless, the depth of the game was in the NG+. The variance, and strange were typical BGS, just not in a format anyone was used to.

All in all, I hope you'll ignore the hate and enjoy the game. The gun play is fun, the space travel and combat is in fact fun, and the story, while not as riveting as KCD2 or RDR2, was still good enough to enjoy. 

As an aside, regarding comments about paid mods: 1) If you don't have the self control to not buy them, then the shame belongs on you. 2) People who put time and effort into creating content do in fact deserve compensation, especially if it is good content!

Planets being empty- Incorrect, go to the other side of the fuckin planet there are millions of plants, animals, and resources, WRONG.

Physics and Water - I have seen the videos of the game where the water detail is garbage and it doesn't look good at all and Skyrim roasts this game with water features, NOW the game looks fantastic and the water movement has either been patched or that was footage of experimental gameplay during alpha or beta, COME ON IN THE WATER IS FINE.

Not enough weaponry- get into new game plus you fuckin loser.

Gender Horseshit- The gender shit in the game is HARDLY visible. It has been toned down to a whisper because im not here to worry about if you have a cock or not im here to shoot bad guys and blow up ships and make MILLIONS of credits.

Game is Boring - This is not a problem with the game this is a problem with your god damn attention span and just makes you look like a Gen alpha coconut brain. This game is full of stories, this game is full of people this game is full of chatter where Skyrim, the greatest game of all time, has THE SAME 12 lines of dialogue per character. YOU are the problem NOT Bethesda. Yeah, they could have used procedural generation to build caves. but if that's your biggest complaint, go do some bandits camps because there are THOUSANDS that are unique and that immediately tells me that your an idiot who only does the campaign expecting the full experience. EAT SAND.

No Character, No passion - WHO TF ARE YOU PICASSO. Take your hoity toity shit and LEAVE gaming because you are scum and your opinions are dogshit. You have no evidence, you have no character, you have no passion. Go find something to complain about because where ever you are the complaints seem to follow.

NOW, if you haven't played this game since its release, and have left a negative review you are in fact mindless scum. If you have less than an hour in the game and threw in the towel. It was your machine, not the game, get better equipment. I have spent 800+ hours in skyrim, I have spent over 10,000+ hours in World of Warcraft. I know what a good game looks like. I know what a good story feels like, I know what deep characters and content feels like. I ROASTED this campaign in 60 hours, but realized that with the New Game plus additional content, and DLC I haven't scratched the surface, I have yet to build a massive ship, i have yet to discover every perk, i have yet to BUILD A REFINERY on a planet. BUT. I have discovered that the replayability of this game is EXTRAORDINARY. This game is literally, 10/10 and ISN'T 11/10 because 5 bugs? GET OVER YOURSELVES. This game objectively, can be a candidate for one of the best games of all time. WoW, Skyrim, Elden Ring, Starfield. Please, get better equipment, PLAY ON PC CONSOLE SCUM, and try this game in 2025 because I believe it has the potential to be the greatest game ever made.

UPDATE: Everything in the game is great, hundreds of hours well spent. Minus about 10-20 hours for the Shattered Space dlc planet. This story, was an LGBTQ+ NIGHTMARE. I have zero interest in dealing with every single person on the planet being homosexual, there would be no population on that planet period because nobody on the planet could have children of their own. This was absolutely nothing but shoving ideologies down my throat for literally no reason, and no appeal. It was made very BLATANT who was fucking who and the words HIS HUSBAND and HER WIFE, were loud in your face and obnoxious. I don't want to hear about where your private parts have been. JUST TELL ME WHO TO SHOOT. I don't come here for blatant displays of sexuality i just want to blow shit up...

Starfield,1716740,190997724,"TLDR: A mile wide an an inch deep

Bethesda is trying to look to the future while simultaneously refusing to leave the past. Once you get over the hype of ""Fallout or Elder Scrolls in space!"" you quickly realize that this game is empty and devoid of personality. Empty planets with the same procedurally generated ships and buildings. Total lack of dungeon crawls. Loading screen simulator. Weapon modding is stupid; you just flat out lose your old mod when you replace it with a different one. The temple mini game is the most rage inducing, waste of time ever. It feels like the devs are intentionally mocking you making you do it over and over again. No local maps at launch. Etc, etc. They should have just stuck to the solar system. Have some sort of Mad max scenario going on on earth, well developed moon base and martian society, colonies in the asteroid belt, etc. If you've ever seen or read The Expanse by James SA Corey, Starfield should have been basically just that. Keep it simple, keep it interesting. You can expand into deep space or other galaxies later with DLC or mods. They tried to do something new and bold and I appreciate that. They just way overreached their capabilities and delivered something lifeless and utterly boring.",False,4,3276
Starfield,1716740,190990667,"So hitting this game hard! 
  I love space games and loved the custom feel of games like elder scroll and fallout series, and what they had to offer.  The game is a hard space adventure with custom choices to make your play-though different every time you play. Also offer a unique twists to play though.
 
 That said. It is SAD to say, its a different then Elder scrolls/Fallout. This game is a BUG FILLED GAME. From the audio clips never matching up (miracle if it does), to the auto click of parts (ship building and outpost building) causing more pain then help. I have played at this time 103 hours of game, 73 in the past week. 

This all being said. The game is a shooter-level up-custom charter builder-custom ship building- but I exclude the outpost/town builder part. IT SUCKS HARD. Why? Because you need to use these function to make it easier to make money in the game and to get resources you may need for building your outpost. I played on default controls. There maybe a setting that I may not being seeing but controls for building are rough.

  Your companions are nothing more the problems in combat. They will get between you and your target in a fire fight, to exposing you while sneaking, to as well want to UN alive them for the non stop ""when you got a minute."" dialog. Dont get me wrong, I love the dialog that characters have but OK! They said it! Make it a mission and drop it. A hour of game play, said it 20 times. Outpost building left me on the floor, I placed a desk and it goes right out the window, outside the build bubble. DONE. reload save and pissed. 
Ship building: sometimes you get double ship in dock and can not walk around have to reload game or worse reload save after it get stuck. 
Mind you I have not played with any Mods or DLCs.
 This game falls short, just like star citizen, and no mans sky.  Its like if we had all these groups team up we would really great space game! Worth the price that we pay for these games. That being said could the DLCs or Mods improve the game, yet to find out. 

So I am level 27 now. Most of the game is done. Love the story. Feels like it was pushed sooo hard! It could had been better? YES. Do they have a chance to fix it. YES. If they did fix all the major issues with the start of the story, the audio bugs and the builder bugs. The game could live on for 15 years. But I feel this will be dropped hard. 

After all that, will I still play? YES.

Do I recommend this game: YES, if you love space adventure. NO NO NO, if you want to build a space empire, like to add details to settlements. Looking for full immersion. 

Looking forward to the mod community saving another AAA game.",True,1,16240

Starfield,1716740,190980320,"So much hate in reviews for this game... I can understand some of it, but i still find it somehow ""unfair"". I purchased Starfield with LOW expectations, here is what i can say after about 40 hours in:

CONS:
- Game is quite ""bland"", in the sense that there's nothing ""masterclass"" about it. The game isn't ""bad"", it just isn't ""great"", and many people wanted it to be ""great"". No epic feeling like The Elder Scrolls, no immersion and choices & consequences like Fallout... Not memorable at all, so far.
- Game can be very repetitive if you were hoping to have lots of ""variety"" when ""exploring"". As many people said, randomly generated settlements, enemies outposts and such end up all looking the same. In a way, this repetitiveness kills the ""exploration"" vibe. The hand scanner is more of a gimmick than an immersive way to reward exploration. 
- Characters, although being voice-acted, have facial expressions which fail in comparison to other games (Cyberpunk 2077,...), and.. i dunno, the magic ain't totally here.
- Ship designs is meh, ship combat is meh, not terrible but not ""good"" either.

All this confirms many of the ""negative"" reviews i have read. Now, if you are the ""right type"" of player, don't let this discourage you:

PROS:
- Graphics look good. Seriously, with a good PC you don't need to tweak the settings or such bullshit, game looks good. I was amazed as the details on space suits for example. 
- Game is very casual-friendly: if like me you have a job and a family, and just want to relax playing, Starfield is really easy to play and get into. Unless you make the enemies harder in the settings, they tend to pose a quite modest challenge. You have a sense of growing your character and equipping them with more powerful stuff, of getting richer, buying larger ships... It uses the typicaly Bethesda gameplay, made even more ""casual"" in a sense. This casual-friendliness may be a drawback for some players though.
- There are TONS of voice acted quests and unique interactions you can have with NPCs. Once you really get into faction quests and such, the game can become immersive. There's tons to do, so if you just play for a bit from time to time, you can get back to this game like you'd get back to your old comfortable pair of slippers. Not an ""awesome"" experience, but a ""comfortable"" experience.

I personally have mixed feelings for Starfield, but find it comfortable enough to enjoy the tons of content and chill experience it offers.

I've got over 100 hours into it so far and I've barely scratched the surface of this massive universe.
  
Being able to add mods to customize game play, graphics or anything else is a major bonus, too.  Again, this is a great game.  In the top echelon of fun.  Have no problem running this on a three year old PC running a GTX 3090 at 2k, everything maxed and graphics modded with HD textures, etc.  I'd easily rate this game a 90%.

(Spoiler warning!) 

I've sat on this review for a while, trying to figure out exactly how I feel about the game.  

The idea behind Starfield is great, but the way Bethesda executed it feels... off. The game comes across as soulless and empty, leaving a sense of loneliness—not the good kind, but the kind that makes the world feel hollow.  

The only moment that genuinely broke through this feeling for me was meeting my alternate-universe self. It was an exciting moment! I thought, *What would my in-game parents and siblings (alt-me has two siblings) think when they see me with my twin?* So, I brought my alt-self to them... and to my disappointment, there was zero reaction. No dialogue, no acknowledgment—nothing.  

That was the moment my Bethesda fanboy shield cracked. Up until then, I was willing to overlook the game’s flaws, but after that? I started seeing the low effort that I had been blind to before.  

At first, I didn’t mind the fast travel system. I figured I could live without real, seamless space travel. Then, I played Star Citizen and realized how much I was missing. Starfield’s approach makes the galaxy feel disconnected and artificial.  

Melee combat? It's bad. I know Starfield is a gun-focused game, but they could have done something to make melee more engaging. With all the advanced tech and diverse factions, why aren't there any unique fighting styles? I dedicated my life to the Great Serpent, but he couldn’t teach me one cool kick or punch? Come on.  

The story is... alright. It’s not bad, but it could have been so much better. I genuinely thought the game was building toward a first contact moment—humanity finally meeting an alien race, our character making history. But no, the Starborn turned out to just be humans. Such a missed opportunity. Starfield could have delivered something unforgettable. And it doesnt have to be about aliens or anything. Like I know they wanted to do their own approach to it ig but you get what im saying. The starborn are cool but imagine if they weren't humans and instead aliens wanting to guide humans to like a next level civilization type of deal. Like how cool would that be. 

I’ve put a lot of time into this game—got my character to level 85, jumped the Unity multiple times, saw some of the unique surprises in NG+. Some quests are cool, but most feel too short and too similar. And honestly? None of my choices felt impactful. The only real effect my decisions had was making certain enemy types spawn less often. That’s it.  

Then there’s the DLC, which was... meh. The hand-crafted city area was neat, but the quests? Forgettable. I can’t even remember any of the characters’ names in the DLC. The story didn’t really grab me until the end, and even then, it wasn’t anything special (Boss fight was cool tho). I was expecting to meet the Great Serpent, but that unfortunately never happened. And don’t get me started on the ghost enemies—those things teleport at random and will appear behind you in an instant.

To top it off, the game forces you to join the city’s religion just to get inside. I was fine with that... until I realized the entire conversion process took five to ten minutes, and suddenly, I was in. It felt rushed and meaningless.  

Bethesda also needs to look into whats causing a specific bug that ruins the whole game for myself and thousands of others. Basically you could be playing the game and then when you hit escape to save the game or just hit escape in general and then back out to the game the FPS drops drastically to less than 20. No one knows why and it makes the game unplayable even on a god tier pc. Thousands of players have this bug even with no mods. PLEASE look into fixing it devs.

With all this in mind, it just leaves me heartbroken for what this game really could have been.

https://youtu.be/urEMD71xdCs

For me, my primary complaint comes down to exploration.  I purchased Starfield because I wanted to explore space.  I wanted to see dangerous alien ecosystems, wild landscapes, multiple building types, interesting characters, engaging game mechanics, all supported by various playstyles,  I wanted to feel rewarded for exploring.   I wanted to get into a spaceship, fly to a planet, find something worthwhile, and leave with a sense of wonder, accomplishment or adventure.

Instead, I navigate several nested menus and magically appear on a meaningless AI-generated planet map.  Every boring world is either utterly barren or sporadically dotted with copy-and-pasted points of interest and the same three buildings on an embarrassingly flat landscape.

Life forms of anything other than human is left to the vastly under populated and underwhelming planetscapes. Game play is fine, as it plays like fallout 4 in space, just without the PIPboy or atmosphere (pun intended lol). Dialog choices are limited to a typical normal response on top, followed by a verity of seemingly unnecessary aggressive responses I personally wouldn't chose.  The impact the choices have on the story appear to not exist, so I have skipped most of the story and just shot my way to where I am now in the game.

Starfield,1716740,190731348,"I'm 17 hours in and I explored leisurely a few planets, and reached level 10. First outpost is up and waiting for enough resources to be further developed. Exploration on a buggy is definitely better, once you get one. The basic buggy is cumbersome to drive, I expect the next one to have more grip. Enemies are not so bright, but they do offer enough resistence. I have yet to understand how research works, or what do factions do. Voice overs are professional. Flying the space ship is slow, but I'm still flying the first one, with no upgrades. Dogfights are relatively interesting, but then this is not a simulator. No crew yet. Flying from one point to the other takes time, but the map gives you the possibility to reach anything you have already explored. Charging screens happen often, they are not a big deal. POIs are large, well decorated, full of resources and trinkets. Mainly trinkets. No bugs, no clipping, no being stuck between two rocks. I have been killed once in an ambush, and later by flying squirrels. Effing flying squirrels are definitely the worst.
I'm mainly into indie games, so playing a polished game like this one is a nice diversion. The game is so good I'll buy the DLCs. I did the same thing for Fallout Las Vegas and Fallout 4, first tried the game, then took the DLCs.
You'll taste a nice balance between exploration, missions, resource gathering, base building, fighting, flying, driving, ship building, character progression, stealth (some), stealing, cooking, and all that I haven't experienced yet.
Highly recommanded if you enjoy role playing and space exploration.
------
278 hours later the game showed many of its glitches. I have yet to finish several missions, the content is there, fully voiced. Higher difficulty systems lack missions, life is quite scarce out there. The game offers many surprises. Even if the global faction system feels incomplete, the individual missions are very entertaining. POIs are repetitive but are also very large so that you need a few passages to remember them.
This game has all the quality (fully voiced, long and well scripted missions, hundred of planets, dozen of NPCs to meet and befriend), and the defects of a triple A game (mission stoppers, repetitive POIs, awkward inventory management, awkward base building, many features without purpose).

Often, I play the game and wonder why I’m playing it. It makes me ask myself what I’m trying to get out of it. Fun? Not having it. Intrigue? None anymore, but I think Hadrian is cute and the UC Vanguard questline is awesome. My love for Hadrian is what got me into modding, actually. I say Starfield inspired me to start designing games (I finished my first game in January, woohoo), but what I actually mean is Hadrian’s story, design, and lovely voice actor inspired me to start making my own things. 

The most important thing to take away from this review is that Starfield is a game with few very good parts, many mediocre, and more bad parts than good parts.

Starfield,1716740,190658644,"I'm going to be honest. I've tried playing this game three times now. The first two times, I was bored, but I wasn't offended enough to leave a review. This third time, I installed quite a few mods and I was no longer bored. In fact, I was having a bit of fun getting arrested by the UC Security before joining the Crimson Fleet and going along their quest line. Right at the end, however, when it should be challenging and fun, I was faced with what I believe to be, with no exaggeration, the least fun experience I have ever had gaming. There was no challenge. I simply had to attack the Vigilance. For 15 minutes, my guns did absolutely nothing to it. Its health pool, combined with that of its shield system and the recharge rate of its shields meant I could not progress. At the same time, its guns were doing absolutely nothing to my ship. It was a stalemate.

I thought this was simply a skill issue on my part. After all, my ship's weaponry wasn't the greatest. But a quick google search revealed that there were many people who faced this same problem. They recommended turning the difficulty down to very easy, which I did and tried to continue the mission. It took close to another **45 minutes** to actually disable the ship and board it. Thank God I had a second monitor so I could actually do something while my fingers were getting sore, pressing both mouse buttons and the G key. Never have I had the joy sucked from a video game so quickly (joy which, keep in mind, I had to mod into the game).

I enjoy the multiple companions that are available, which is a major part of the game. I like the shooty shooty missions and finding new places to explore. I bought my first new ship and still have many parts of the game to figure out. It is quite a fun game, though I'm still a noob with it. 

It's a heavily quest based space combat, FPS ground shooter with an extremely high NPC social content. Nay-sayers are upset that it isnt a new Skyrim or Elder Scrolls Six game... well, no, it is a well done, story-based, open-world space game that stands on its own. 

It reminds of the Mass Effect series ... except Starfield has space combat.

So, pros:

NPCs bring life to this single player game
Ship combat
FPS combat on the ground and in space 
Lots of quests
Open world 
A number of organizations to join and do missions with. 
A massive world.

Cons:

Cut scenes for ship take off, landing.
Actually travelling by ship from A to B can be graphically skipped and replaced by a button click if you've already been there once. The game is more an RPG and less of a space flight simulation.
Lack of in-game tutorials. I understand people are going to just Google their way to understanding the game anyway, but it would have been nice to not have to alt tab out of the game so much.

The whole way through the game it felt like something big was missing and I was never able to put a finger on it. It just felt...[i]flat[/i]. I hated the spacefight UI and I hated the lack of proper physics response. Hitting the directional thrusters while heading in a straight line should have resulted in a 180-degree ship rotation that should have it facing back along the line of flight while still continuing in the same direction. Instead you got a big loop that was much more like flying biplanes in a WW1 flight sim. The ship UI itself smacked of the simplest (and unfortunately the nastiest) way to solve the problem of displaying the same data across multiple cockpits. Instant immersion crash until you got used to it.

The only really meaningful companion story arc was Andreja. Sarah's story arc did its best but the rest were all meh. Surprisingly, the one companion NPC I did get attached to was Lyn. Unlike the others, even though she only had a relatively short appearance, for some reason she felt more real.

I also found the shipbuilding as frustrating as all hell. It improved with patches and practice but it was still possible to lose a part inside the main ship and the only way to recover was to bail out from the shipbuilder, losing anything you might have done along the way. I soon learned to save-scum that one.

Starfield,1716740,190652017,"Ah, Starfield—Bethesda's ambitious leap into the cosmos, where players can finally live out their spacefaring dreams. Let's chart a course through its stellar highs and black-hole lows.

Pros:

•	Expansive Universe: Imagine a galaxy teeming with planets, each waiting for your footprints. Starfield offers a vast playground for explorers. 
•	Ship and Outpost Customization: Ever fancied yourself a spaceship designer or a frontier architect? The game's robust customization mechanics let you build and tweak to your heart's content. 
•	Engaging Side Quests: Beyond the main storyline, the game offers a plethora of side missions that add depth and variety to your journey. 

Cons:

•	Underwhelming Main Story: The central narrative may not grip all players, with some finding it less compelling than expected. 
•	Repetitive Exploration: While there's a galaxy to explore, some planets and locations can feel monotonous, leading to a sense of déjà vu. 
•	Technical Issues: Despite improvements, players have reported bugs and performance hitches that can disrupt the immersive experience. 

In summary, Starfield shoots for the stars with its expansive universe and customization options but encounters turbulence with its main narrative and technical hiccups. For those eager to explore the cosmos, it offers a vast sandbox, though some may wish for a more polished voyage.

It has very little personality and there's nothing to make it distinct. It's an open-world game that's a good time-waster and that's about it. It's not a very good FPS game, it's not a very good stealth game, it's not a very good crafting game. It's open-world and that's about all it is.

I've been really enjoying it and i'm currently at 35 hours. Sticking to the story and side stories so far feels like there isn't really much reused content. I know if you explore planets, you can run into a lot of duplicate facilities and stuff. so yeah. maybe if i get to 100 hours I'll be tired of the game. but as a first time play through, id say its definitely a good game. going through the vanguard quests and its been so fun discovering the secrets behind the Terramorphs. I thought i wouldn't like space fus ro dah but I do. So main story is actually really fun as well. I love the NASA Punk theme. If you like Sci-fi themes this game is great!

Some Bad.

Non important NPCs look horrifying. Their faces are like the most horrified looking faces ever. They look like they saw Cthulhu or something.

A lot of Items don't seem like Junk but are. Starting out, I was grabbing all kinds of Medical equipment and wires cause they all seem like useful components for crafting but they are not.

Fast travel kind of takes space out of the entire game. its a little disappointing when you realize you don't have to go to your ship to leave a planet. you can straight fast travel from a building in a specific city to another building in a specific city on another planet lol.

The game is more about being on planets and doing normal Fallout/Elderscrolls things than just being an interesting space game. I wish they had more space. The immersion really breaks in space to me. I imagine Elite dangerous every time I'm in space and just wish it was more like that lol.

Some of the dialogue options are so... Millenial... and its lame. I'm a millenial btw. but you don't have to choose these options so thank goodness for that.

First, the core game I actually liked very much. The mods are also fun especially those that are ""Approved"" and don't halt progress. I've put in multiple hours, finding countless ways to occupy my time and I've stepped into NG+ multiple times now to enjoy the story in various ways.

I recently acquired Shattered Space and, frankly, I find it offensive that this was a PREMIUM charged add-on. Not only is the ENTIRE MODULE just a massive set of bundled fetch-quests and BS (thank GOD for the Model Atlantis or I probably just would've uninstalled it and missed all the INSANE BUGS in this nearly full-game-priced ripoff).

At one point, I actually had one of the phantoms  challenge me, asking why I'm doing this and, honestly, I found myself largely agreeing with her. What a waste of time and energy.

That's a tough sell, and one that is poorly suited to a game that otherwise is based around gun combat. Bethesda doesn't seem interested in fleshing out the ""archaeology"" elements any more than a general ""mystery box"" plot in the style of Lost.

Landing on planets limits you to a few kilometres that you can explore. and those planets may have one unique thing to them, but there's no soul, no feeling of exploring the unknown.

The storytelling, another hallmark of Bethesda games, feels thin and uninspired in Starfield.

After playing the game through almost to the end as far as missions go, and I'm now at a point where I want to build Outposts, decorate my houses, and so on .. I'm going to give Starfield 6/10, the 6 for some interesting parts, like the Ship Building and general ideas like the Research and Weapon/Gear modifications .. but, the game loses 4 solid points for one thing alone ..

.. the terrible restrictions on placing items, such a food items on a shelf, which you'd imagine was perhaps the easiest task imaginable, but Starfield turns it into a constant fight with the restrictions built into the game itself as far as object collision and physics goes.

So .. 6/10 for Starfield. 
Slightly above average for what should have been a great game, even with some very good mods, considering all the experience Bethesda could/should have gained from Fallout 4.

Well, the game has bugs, after 7 years in development and nearly 2 years after its release, but then this is Bethesda, and this is not unusual for them.

My first game crash too .. so, definite Bethesda normalisation of SNAFU.

Also, Steam Achievements will be disabled if you ACCIDENTLY open the console window and don't enter any command, just opening it does this.

My next play through will be with Mods, much like Fallout 4, using a lot of good Mods which will make Starfield the game it was supposed to be.

I am hooked - This game is phenomenal - the story telling is excellent, the worlds are huge and well defined, the graphics are beautiful, and I am honestly blown away and enthralled. I haven't been this excited and into a game in a long time!! The game play is smooth - combat is fun and engaging and challenging on normal difficulty, space combat is a blast and super thrilling and also challenging - I got in over my head once with pirates and it was a tough spot to be in but very rewarding when I finally succeeded. 

Story wise - the stakes are high, the choices to become who you want to be in the starfield are amazing, the characters are intriguing and there are so many of them living their lives out there. This game isn't one you just pick up for a little bit here and there - it's one you sit down with like a good book and really get into.

The only caveat I would say to others is - don't expect the game to be No Man's Sky. It is not No Man's Sky. It's Bethesda - It's Fallout and Skyrim but in space. It's ~wonderful~!! <3",True,3,5014

I don't blame Bethesda really, you people buying Skyrim 5 times taught them to be this way. 

Another piece of advice from someone who works around M&A, as soon as your favorite software developer is acquired by a big company, like Zenimax, it's gone.  Bethesda isn't going to be anything more than what it is now, it is past its peak.  This isn't an opinion, Zenimax bought it as an investment instrument and expects it to pay out at better performance than what they paid for it, which would have been some multiplicative value of its revenue or EBITDA. They do this by ""streamlining"" , aka cost cutting, aka not taking risks for developing things that they know people are already paying for.  I'm not saying there aren't logical fallacies in that line of thinking - I'm just saying that is what happens. Todd isn't driving the ship anymore, and he wasn't the design visionary he worked hard to portray himself to be. Everything was about the sale to Zenimax and executives often receive great ongoing deals to stay on as the face after a merger to convince the idiots that they are still getting a great candid product.",False,667,8344

After the initial how to, how you play is up to you, spend a day on a single planet scanning and building up a base, or maybe jump from tiny quest to tiny quest killing off. Spend a few hours engaging in space battles, or following up of companion stories. 

My advise is to ignore the haters who find one glitch and say its crap, and give it a chance.

Starfield,1716740,190182527,"I am a Space and science fanatic and have played countless space-themed games. I bought Starfield after sinking thousands of hours into games like Star Citizen, Stellaris, X4, Kerbal Space Program, Prey, Endless Space 1 and 2, Terra Invicta, Sins of a Solar Empire 1 and 2, and many more. So, when I heard that Starfield was coming out and was being developed by Bethesda, I was instantly drawn to it. I heard it had about 1000 planets and moons and so much more to explore so I was SO excited and I was instantly sold when I saw the gameplay videos and other content showcase videos. So I pre-purchased Starfield as soon as possible and started playing as soon as it released. Then I was taken back by all the loading screens and other various issues I had. So I put it down for a bit. BUT... I decided to start a new game and seriously put some time into it because I really wanted to love it. So, once I got a bit further into the game, I was hooked. It is gorgeous and there are so many places that are exactly the kind of awe-inspiring scenes I would hope to see if we were one day able to travel through the universe. I have FAR more hours than it shows here, too, but that's a whole other story. But after a couple patches and large updates, most of the issues people had with the game are fixed and Bethesda has a lot planned for the future of Starfield. So, anyone who is a fanatic of space and Sci-Fi like me and also loves really in-depth RPGs, you should DEFINITELY give Starfield a chance. I am REALLY happy that I did. It is a gorgeous, well thought out, amazing adventure. There is an incredible amount of content and things to do. The different jobs and ways to earn money is enough to keep ya busy for countless hours. I have definitely played over 300 hours (not counting the 38 hours in my new game) and I haven't even scratched the surface of all the places to explore and activities to start. The characters you meet are diverse and the stories that progress with each path you choose are very interesting. One thing I will recommend when you first start is don't worry about grabbing every bit of loot. There is SOOO much you can pick up so, especially in the beginning, just grab the most valuable stuff like gear and weapons and stuff like that. You can also go back to places if you need something later. So i suggest you just stick with it and once the story opens up and you can start choosing the direction you want, you will really start enjoying the gorgeous world they created. That combat and gun-play is definitely fun. The enemies are extremely diverse. The near-infinite possibilities of exploration form a wild ride. The ship building is really interesting once you open up the vast amount of options to customize them the way you want. The incredible amount of ways to make money definitely keeps you engaged and makes it so you can switch things up when one method starts to become a bit repetitive. Then there's the mods which offer an incredible amount customization with so many options. So, I definitely recommend you give it a chance. I can only imagine the work that went into creating a game of this magnitude. I believe it deserves an honest chance.

The universe looks limitless at first glance, a thousand planets, endless promises. But the reality? Fetch quests across procedurally generated outposts that all blur together.

It’s like being promised a trip around the world, only to spend most of it stuck in identical airport terminals. Technically serviceable. Completely forgettable.

Because it's March 2025 and there hasn't been a peep from little boy bro Howard on how he plans on continuing to drive his company into the ground since November. I could talk about the sterilization of the game, or all the subtle ways the plot tries to get you to play how little boy bro Howard wants you to (i.e. all the best companions and crew are in constellation, all refuse to help you if you want to be piratey, FORCED into Constellation (Conste-suck) without player CONSENT because little boy bro Howard sterilized the game and made Conste-suck the end-all, be-all faction. Gone are options from past games (the things that made the games so good) because you don't get to side with who you might want to for the grand finale, you HAVE to side with Conste-suck. Remember when little boy bro Howard said it was going to be like No Man's Sky but good? Well, NMS is already a great game, and little boy bro Howard couldn't even figure out how to get from planet to space without a loading screen. The game is basically one giant fast-travel simulator built on the back of an engine that didn't look good in 2020 and certainly looks awful now. I've played every game BGS has ever released. But if little boy bro Howard thinks I'm even going to consider TES6 after this tragedy, well, there's a reason we call him little boy bro Howard. Well, that and ToddBucks, the HIGHLY PREDATORY in-game currency you can purchase to buy mods from the creation club.

Starfield,1716740,189868853,"Doesn't feel like a true Bethesda game.

If you're asking yourself ""should I buy this?"" here is a quick way to figure that out:
Are you going to mod the game? If yes, then buy it. If no, then do not buy it. It's that simple.

This game has 3 core issues:
a.) It tries to be a space game without actually managing to be a space game. The actual ""space"" part of it plays abysmally (ship combat is a joke, and you can and should skip 80% of ship travelling process with fast travel because otherwise you're wasting an unreasonable amount of time just watching the same cutscenes and animations for a 10 second or less in-space timeframe). This isn't a matter of the genre being a problem; we've seen games like No Mans Sky get this part right, even if the rest of that game was less than lively. But Bethesda just chose to make it a space-thematic game, not a space game

b.) It feels like we went backwards. It takes more from the Fallout progression system, where you just get total XP not tied to specific categories, and can level up anything. I personally feel this is going away from the iconic ""level-what-you-use"" system that TES has. Also, little things--taking gear off of enemies does not visibly remove it from them, the game has more bugs and more game-breaking issues than previous titles (as much as people give Bethesda a hard time about this, I think its fair to say that an average playthrough of Skyrim or Fallout has minor bugs or user-error type bugs. This game feels like there's a major game-breaking issue every 20 minutes to worry about), and the UI is disappointingly unintuitive compared to what I've learned to expect from previous titles. Also, the perk system just kinda... Sucks. You look at games like Fallout and Skyrim, then you look at this and ask yourself... Was this a completely different dev team?
*(Quick Edit, now that I've spent even more time playing... the gameplay loop doesn't even feel like thought or effort was put into it at all? Several of the MAIN STORY missions take place in the exact same couple of dungeons? Like, cookie-cutter identical. No feeling of new exploration, no unique puzzles to solve, just: go here, shoot this, grab that. I thought I was critical before I wrote this review, but it only gets worse. Imagine Skyrim if every other main quest mission was ""return to Bleak Falls Barrow!"" with the same exact objective and enemy spawns. Yikes.)

c.) The story elements. I've played a lot of games in my time, and there have been plenty where I picked up and said ""ah, this isn't for me, its a kinda boring,"" but this? This isn't boring because its not a game for me. It's boring because the writing was just plain awful. The dialogue feels forced, the main story doesn't even feel like it was cohesive or made sense (""Oh hey, I just met you, take my ship and this extremely valuable thing I came here specifically for, I'll trust you!""), the options feel amusingly limited, and honestly... It feels like they only put enough effort into it to be able to legally call it a game release instead of an engine with a proof of concept attached. Besides the fact the gameplay feels super choppy (see section A about the nonstop fast travel), it just seems like a base created for the sole purpose of being modded / *actually developed* by the community.

So, TLDR, not up to Bethesda standards and buying Starfield is like buying Garry's Mod. Unless you're going to kit it out, don't bother. On that note, everything after the 24 hour mark of gameplay that I've done has been using the Star Wars Genesis modpack, and the game is actually enjoyable, so that's my recommendation to my fellow nerds.",False,9,7335

Starfield,1716740,189830922,"Trust the mixed reviews and avoid this title. 

The writing is abysmal and the game play locks you out of ""standard"" game play functions. Everything is locked behind perks including stealth, you simply can't crouch or sneak until its unlocked. 

I gave it an hour and a half, what killed the experience for me was the way you were thrust into the story. You literally wake up in a mine as a new miner and within ten minuets someone from an organization just hands you his ship/robot. 

The robot sends you on a mission to attack some nameless pirates, you do so and then go drop off this mystical artifact to this group of people who instantly want you to join with zero information/motivation on who you are. 

The game-play feels alright, aside from the way progression locks out what I would consider basic features. The gun play actually is one of its stronger points. Ship to ship combat felt underwhelming and inconsequential. 

By no means is it worth $70

All and all I think it would be worth $35-$40 at most. I just wish the writing held up to any of the quality/level of content that Skyrim or even the previous fallout titles.

What environments do exist that are handcrafted are uninspired with terrible art direction (NASA punk..... come on).

Starfield,1716740,189748458,"It's a good game but not a great game, unlike Skyrim which was amazing for TES in 2011. If you are a fan of TES and Bethesda games you should have already played this, especially if you can get it on a sale.

The good thing about this game is that if you are a fan of sci-fi you can find fun things to do. The faction you play as in the main quests sometime reminds me of a what a failed attempt to launch a Starfleet type organisation would be like in a world that is not so idyllic for humans and the universe reminds me of the one from Dark Matter.

The game mechanics we all know from Fallout 4 and others have been recycled to a very bland flavour with some exceptions: Good FPS mechanics and movement, some great quests and locations, ship building and editing, not the actual ship flying and combat though. The new stuff is often lackluster, like the ship flying, which only serves to limit you from fast travelling across the galaxy too quickly and to force some random encounters/events. The skills and powers mechanics are especially uninspired.

It's still a good game, that will give you dozens of hours of gamepaly if not hundreds, with or without mods.

It doesn't perform very well. I build this PC with this game in mind and needed an upgrade anyway, so it should have been running smooth as butter. The game was even included with the GPU... 

I run the game with everything on high, with upscaling disabled and game rendered at full resolution on 1080p. According to AMD i'm in the 95th percentile with 112 FPS on average. Yet the game has constant frame drops in cities, large inside locations or locations with 0 gravity, even when capped at 60FPS. Basically any time there are a lot of objects in play, it's gonna drop frames, so you better have a beast of a CPU.

Overall we need to let Bethesda know that this is not gonna be profitable for future TES or Fallout titles, if they even care.
They are now owned by the same company that owns xbox and windows... so what's the excuse when their game has a terrible launch and is simply not optimised to run on even just an above average PC?

unfortunately by the time i tried the game twice and had the same experience, too much time had passed and i could no longer refund.

so i pushed through, and accidentally discovered that this game is actually a jewel. yes the intro sucks and yes all the characters have uninspiring dialogue (and animations). actually, the dialogue is almost castrated: i think they let too many dei feminists play developer and the entire dialogue suffered.

but if you just ignore the dialogue, this is what you'll get: absolutely stunning environments (everywhere there's a futuristic hi-tech place to explore it's a joy), great looting and shooting experience (very fun & reactive), and super interesting missions (mainly because they lead you to cool places and the mission writing itself is good, but the dialogue sucks so you need to ignore it).

so, considering that the dialogue sucks but this game has tons of exciting places to visit with cool missions to do, i would say it's a 50-50: you either can ignore the dialogue and immerse into the atmosphere, and if so you'll love it a lot... or you'll  notice all the flaws (including loading screens) and won't be able to enjoy it.

i would strongly recommend checking out the game if you have a good gpu, bc it's such good environments that they offset all the other flaws. and the missions are plentiful: truly there's a lot of fun to have. this is one of the coolest most DETAILED games bethesda has ever done. i mean, there's details everywhere in the environment, everything was painfully hand crafted, it's just a joy to explore! and there's missions to keep you going, just jumping around admiring every environment....

it's too bad they ruined the dialogue and made the characters all stupid otherwise others would have enjoyed it too (everything is politically correct, the super cool mysterious leader of the main bounty hunters' assassin faction is some kind of non-binary they/them, men are gay while women are warriors, and every companion is super annoyed if you do anything remotely ""bad""). anyway, i think it's nearly a masterpiece because i've never seen such detailed environments and solid questlines to get you around. others will say it's trash, i say it's nearly the best game bethesda put out (minus acting and main story), definitely the best world. do what you want write comments if you need clarification!",True,0,3448

Starfield,1716740,189648690,"Now the the sting of the initial purchase has worn off I think it's fair to flip my review from thumbs down to thumbs up. That means the caveat to this is that you buy the game on a discount.

I think Starfield is a good proof of concept. It does some things really well. Different planets have different gravity which I think is something that is truly novel. Jumping into the game to shoot people in a sci-fi setting is pretty well delivered on. Overall, the mechanics of the game in a vacuum are all delivered upon competently and when you put them all together in one package you get a theoretically good game. That said, the game's practical issues are still pretty numerous. 

If you're not on a nicer rig, the load times are going to be a fucking pain in the ass. Overworlds are much smaller and more sparse compared to Elder Scrolls games so the implementation of load screens feels significantly more annoying. I'm running a setup slightly better than the game's listed recommended settings and playing on a modless game doesn't feel too bad. So if you're the same this won't be a significant issue.

The player background options are pretty neat. I liked being able to have access to parents and an adoring fan by choice. The parents also do their own traveling so you get some cute little easter eggs from time to time. The parents also get modeled based off your playable character so they ""fit"" in universe regardless of what you look like. That said, aside from the brief, ""heh that's neat"" moments you get with them, there's not much else interaction.

That's basically par for the course for the entirety of Starfield. You get a lot of stuff executed fairly competently on its own. You can see the amibition that was there, but none of it works well together. You can fly around in your space ship and dog fights feel pretty fun, but you can't explore the universe in it like you can in No Man's Sky or in Elite Dangerous. Ground missions are fine since you have a decent number of small immersive details that make it feel good, but you can't stay anywhere for too long since most planets are just boring and barren. There is something of a relationship system in the game, but it's not deep enough to feel worthwhile which sucks because you can create an entire crew to man your bases. And of course the whole base building aspect is pretty cool as well, but is really a fucking pain in the ass to grind out with out mods that essentially help you cheat.

So overall Starfield is a jack of all trades, master of none kind of game. I think it offers echoes of what we can hope for in the future when game designers can learn from its mistakes and technical tools improve to allow for more complex features to be easier to implement, but until that day we'll have to settle with sci-fi games that really focus in on certain elements of gameplay rather than trying to be as ambitious as something like what Starfield was imagined to be.",True,0,3549

Please note for anyone considering buying creation club points on steam, Points MAY NOT BE POSTED TO YOUR ACCOUNT, NO REFUNDS ARE AVAILABLE, and as of now, NO OFFICIAL SUPPORT FOR CREATION CLUB POINTS PURCHASE TECHNICAL ISSUES OR FAILED TRANSFERS IS AVAILABLE FROM STEAM OR BETHESDA.

$20 down the drain, can't play the game because I was specifically wanting to check out those creations, who knows if the points will ever come or not....  Absolutely unacceptable from a AAA game from a major company.

This game showed a lot of promise in their marketing, but it woefully undelivers in every way.

To me when hearing quest NPC's speak it felt like listening to someone who speaks in monotone and gives a lecture for 100 hours. It was that boring. The NPC's were all bland and none of them stood out from each other.

The whole spaceship thing to me seemed like a glorified fast travel system rather than actually having much use. Whilst I didn't expect this to be a Star Citizen / Elite / X4 clone, I did expect there to be some more purpose to the ship than what is available in this game.

Basebuilding also seemed to me to be something they added in at the last minute as I cannot actually see the point in them. Money is almost pointless in this game aside from using it to upgrade your ship and restock on ammo.

So I'm stuck in a loop unless I go to an old save which is 2 levels and about 90 min of play time before. Or I go to NG+2 which I don't want to do because I don't want to remake my outposts.

The whole Armillary thing is by far the dumbest f***ing idea of a way to end a game I've ever seen in a game.

I tried to enjoy this game. I really did. I love the Fallout series, I love Elder Scrolls, and space/sci-fi is easily my favorite fictional setting...by all rights if this was a good game I should have enjoyed it.

I did every quest, the most interesting ones are still bland and rely on fetch-quest mechanics for 90% of them. There's very little choice interaction in the game, with a bunch of forced decisions. Nothing feels worth it for quest rewards, so you aren't really motivated to complete them anyway. Named weapons don't feel special. Skills feel more like barriers to enjoyment than they do ability.

Graphically the game is impressive, but performance wise you probably can't really enjoy them too. My PC is well above the recommended specs and I still have major performance loss in certain areas.

There's a bunch of random stuff to craft, but most of it is identical to one another in everything but the visuals. Crafting does not feel fulfilling. 

You can build a ship. It's one of the cooler parts of the game. The caveat is, there's a bunch of rules for how to build your ship, and they don't list what those rules are anywhere.

It’s not that *Starfield* is the worst game ever—it’s the worst because you never actually get to play the game. There’s nothing to explore, nothing to do. Instead, you’re stuck with tedious quests that boil down to talking to forgettable NPCs on outposts or planets. To get to any and every interaction is buried under multiple load screens, and you can’t even fly your ship there—you just fast-travel, sit through a dull conversation, and get a quest marker leading you to another empty planet.  

Bethesda somehow thinks this is good game design. Sure, it looks better than *Fallout 4*, but the writing is so lifeless that you’ll struggle to stay awake. Exploration? Nonexistent. It’s just fast-traveling through a never-ending loop of loading screens and menus, holding a button to trigger another loading screen.  

When you finally reach combat, it’s over before you can even wake up from the monotony. There’s no sense of adventure, no real immersion—just an exhausting series of menu clicks and loading screens pretending to be a game.

Starfield,1716740,189420629,"I really, really tried to like this game. The idea of a new bethesda rpg in a sci-fi space setting sounds awesome, but honestly they really let us down. The game consistently fails the player in so many ways. Skip to the end for the tl;dr.

The UI is terrible. You have to press two different buttons to bring up the local map, and then leaving the local map takes four button presses, including a multiple second animation of you leaving the menu. Everything in the game is like this. Whatever the obvious, streamlined approach to designing an interface would be, bethesda went in the opposite direction. Basic inventory management feels like pulling teeth, which is terrible because inventory management is roughly 40% of this game's playtime due to limited storage options and cargo space.

If these were the only issues, I would probably excuse them and wait for the modders to do the work that bethesda is to lazy to do and release better ui mods. But the story also fails the player by fundamentally misunderstanding what an rpg is. In my opinion the rpg tag on this game's steam page is false advertising. The game forces you to play a very specific character. You have to play a space explorer that's obsessed with collecting artifacts and is willing to steal and murder to obtain them. One of the main quests literally involves slaughtering the crew of an innocent ship to steal an artifact from them. There is no way to persuade the owner of the artifact to sell it to you, nor is there a way to steal it without alerting the ship's security (it is scripted to always turn everyone on the ship hostile). All of the game's four main companions end up looking like hypocrites, because they encourage you to do this but in most other instances will get mad and leave you if you commit crimes. If you aren't willing to murder innocent civilians for the sake of putting together a cool looking rock, then this game isn't for you. The only ""choice"" you get to make with your character is in regards to the faction side quests, which essentially boils down to being one of two flavors of space cop, or being a pirate. And don't even think about getting attached to one of the four main followers, because the story kills off whichever one you like the most. Its specifically scripted to kill the follower you spend the most time with. And after they kill that follower off, they have the gall to not even let the player be sad about it, even if you were romancing that person. Your character immediately dusts themselves off and continues the previous quest, even though your spouse just died a needless death. There's no way to express any grief to any of the other characters.  The main story is full of moments like this, that completely remove the player's agency and railroad you into playing an unfeeling robot that is willing to do anything for the sake of the mission.

On a mechanical side, the outpost building is also missing a ton. There's no foundations, floors, or walls to build with. You can only place small prefab structures that link into each other in specific, limited ways. There's also no regular doors for outpost structures, only airlocks that essentially act as 10 second loading screens any time you want to enter a building. The ""snap together"" is incredibly overbearing, so you can't place objects in the vicinity of each other without the game automatically connecting them in rigid and awkward ways. All of the creativity of the fallout 4 settlement system is completely removed in favor of a cookie cutter ""function over form"" approach that leaves all outposts looking roughly the same.

The game is also very lackluster from a quality assurance perspective. Trees randomly spawned in the middle of my outpost, blocking access to my storage containers. Your followers clip through the floor and talk to you from the other side of walls. The game crashes at random intervals during normal gameplay (as of this review I've gotten five crashes). Enemies can shoot you through closed doors. Enemies also sometimes just stand in front of you not doing anything instead of attacking. The guards that scan my ship in orbit still call my ship the frontier even though I'm flying a completely different, story relevant ship (the razorleaf). Loading screens also occasionally spoil major plot points like [spoiler] Heat Leeches being the source of Terrormorphs [/spoiler]. I didn't even know that it was supposed to be a big reveal because the game told me matter of fact that it was the case before I even got to that quest. Resources you mark as tracked sometimes can't be untracked, so the entire tracked resource system becomes pointless.

The devs also obviously didn't play test the game, since its really easy to accidentally soft lock yourself if you don't play the exact way the devs anticipated. During one of the main story missions, I took a back door out of Neon (one of the game's major cities) instead of walking the long way. Going to the ship and leaving the planet in this manner permanently locks you out of fast travelling, forcing the player to reload. During another story mission (High Price to Pay), I parked my ship in a different spot than the game expected and it ended up soft-locking the game. I had to load an older save just to get the game to work. And these were both main story missions, not obscure side missions.

TL;DR: Overall this game just feels like a cash grab from an out of touch company that didn't really care about the quality of the product so long as it made them their investment back (especially with how much they keep pushing creation club content). There was obviously care put into this game, but no amount of care can overcome the bugs, ui issues, and bad writing.

Starfield,1716740,189356562,"Its a tried and tested formula for Bethesda - if you've played any of their games then you will see that this is basically Fallout 4, which was basically Fallout 3 and then Oblivion before it...But the idea is the same 1st person character, wander round following storylines getting better kit and upgrading your character.  Crafting stations and settlements are all here (its basically Fallout 4 except re-imagined in space).  So its perfectly entertaining.  I haven't completed the main storyline yet as I have got too distracted in all the side quests, some of which are really quite fun.  

Some of the things I like - the look and feel is amazing, they've done a good job with the mechanics and I like the way the ship flies, its nice and easy (as someone who has spent a lot of time in Elite Dangerous I was worried how this would be) and you can wander round your ship.  

Some of the things I dont like:  the interface is incredibly clunky, confusing and oftentimes an absolute pain in the backside.  The Shipbuilding facility is also one of those that you're going to need to watch some youtube videos to understand - they could have made that a lot easier to use.

I can not recommend this game at full price because of it's many issues, but I do recommend trying it out if it was ever on sale. If you are a fan of space and the way Bethesda games play it is worth trying but if not I would stay away. 

Here is a list of pros and cons I had with the game.

Pros
- Decent gun play for a Bethesda game
- Amazing ship building and customising
- Pretty good faction quest lines in the game
- Decent upgrading system for your character
- Some very good random interactions throughout space and side missions
- Some breathtaking scenery good for photo mode
- Decent space battles
- Solid companions and companion quests
- outpost building is pretty good
- very good main cities unfortunately their are only 3
- Good lore involving the war that happened

Cons
- Boring main story that takes too long to get anything going.
- Almost all planets are very barren, boring, and not worth going to
- Auto generation of planets ruins the game and goes against what made Bethesda games good in the first place 
- Many reused assets throughout auto generated planets results in repetitive game play 
- Traversal throughout planets is slow and bad even with the addition of land vehicles
- Lacking choice and consequence for siding with certain factions.
- A lot of loading screens and fast travelling
- Not much weapon variety
- No unique weapons, all randomly generated base weapons which really sucks
- The game wastes your time a lot
- Star born powers just feel like a watered down dragon born shout rip off
-Lack of handcrafted areas and main cities.

Starfield,1716740,189083650,"Lemme start off by sayin' that I absolutely love this game. Why can't I recommend it? Let me put it this way. If you are a Bethesda fan, you already know expectations for this game were way too high. That was inevitable. This game takes so many flaws of Bethesda in the past and multiplies them. That combined with the repeated layouts of locations, the poor writing, and the unholy amount of loading screens creates a symphony that reinforces the ""Bethesda Cycle"" that happens with every single release. 

The issue with Starfield specifically is that, again, it magnifies the problems of the past while also creating new ones such as repeated layouts for POIs over and over and over again. You will see Abandoned Cryo Lab a few times on different planets with the same lore in the same predetermined locations with the same enemy locations with the same locked doors. Over and over for as long as you can tolerate.

COMBAT! I was not even slightly surprised to find out that it inherits the deranged scaling of Fallout 4 with the added kick in the nuts of FURTHER NERFING your dealt damage in each NG+ cycle alongside increasing the damage enemies deal. Sure you can change it with mods that remove NG+ damage changes and use the gameplay settings to more broadly adjust the damage you and your enemies do. The problem is that doing it feels nearly necessary after a certain point and that shouldn't be the case. The gunplay is Fallout 4 without VATS and nearly no changes beyond that. Zero-G is a thing but it really isn't that special and melee isn't great like it was in every Bethesda game before. Aside from the typical basic animations, the scaling of melee is bad despite the buffs they later gave to melee.

The movement. Well, I don't really have any complaints there. The boost packs add a fair bit of vertical movement that previous Bethesda titles just didn't have, which is good for people who want the high ground in a gunfight. Adds a lot of freedom in how you tackle a situation. They aren't perfect but their quality is subjective in this case and I prefer the Skip Packs. Skips have the best forward movement, Power has the best vertical, Balanced is in between. They also consume different amounts of replenishing boost charge so keep an eye on that if you choose to buy this game. 

Ship building. I suck at it and all of mine look ugly as sin. The way this builder is handled is very basic. There is nothing special about it and there doesn't need to be. You have size limits for height and width but that can be modded out. You'll probably notice the theme of ""It can be modded out"" just like other Bethesda titles and that isn't a compliment. I've rambled enough, so I will conclude.

I do not recommend this game unless you are okay with the flaws I mentioned and many I did not. I love this game despite these numerous flaws.",False,2,23393

Ignore any comments saying the game is ""woke"" when I tell you it isn't ""woke"" and that's coming from an anti-woke gamer. Just a couple hiccups in the game design by Bethesda that players have taken too far or added BS context gibberish to validate their biases. If anyone has questions I will be more than happy to respond with an answer as I have an in depth knowledge of this game at this point in time. :)

Pros:

-Good visuals
-Entertaining NG+ differences and the chance to do things differently per run
-Good music
-Interesting NPC variations and a lot of recruitable crew members
-Descent ship designs with some really great ones in the mix, you can also build your own or add too an existing one
-Good pacing
-Alright creations mods or nexus ones, although most will disable achievements of which I don't care about.
-Creations mod that is free by Bethesda based around their Doom game
-Fun exploration although it can get dull with the repetitive same design outposts and other POIs that you stumble upon on planets
-Outpost building can be very fun but is limited without the usage of mod
-Good stories to play out with plenty of side missions to take into account, no need to rush the game for enjoyment
-Wide range of Weaponry/Spacesuits/Packs with plenty of rarity variants of weapons and plenty of unique ones
-Loads of planets to get to know that each offer a scaling difficulty, allows to fun test or limit test yourself against wildlife or NPCs
-Space battles are entertaining, you can always fine tune NPC damage in the in game settings, much like in Oblivion uses of sliders but is far more refined in Starfield.
-Well known game mechanics that aren't hard to get into
-Currently most bugs for me are gone, just a couple that are annoying but are easily overlooked to my patience, rarely have to use console for anything.
-Some characters are annoyingly lovable
-Good voice acting throughout the whole game and especially my man Drexler...of Steve Blum I do so love you Space Cowboy.

Cons:

-Performance without the game on a SSD, strong GPU/CPU, and 12G minimum of ram is very poor and can cause plenty of stuttering or CTDs
-Some ""woke"" and ""pronoun issues"" that some tend to care about but mostly the ""woke"" aspects I don't particularly see but the pronouns I certainly didn't like
-Game can get boring if you rush it or you just generally don't like the limited cities within the settled systems and want more than just two giant ones of New Atlantis and Neon though each locations has its charms and lore as to why they're the way they are.
-The game can be judged as not being worth 70 dollars but 60 dollars with a 15-20 dollar DLC is more correct in my eyes
-The bounty system indeed sucks though I've used mods to correct this
-The game makes it apparent to only have one ""spouse"" but just like Skyrim, I don't care but I use a mod to allow me to marry both main women. Only a con because I like them both and in a game where morality comes into play often, I morally choose to enjoy my time in the starfield with two hotties. My lore, my universe, my Starborn interference.
-Not enough building variation in POIs on planets, they get stale
-NOT ENOUGH CLOTHING OPTIONS FOR MY DRIP (2nd biggest qualm with the game)
-Without mods the outpost and other options for decorations is too limited for my taste and lack functionality
-Food could be of more use since it still costs more credits than they are worth but selling them does net you a good amount of cash.
-Vendor credits are annoyingly small
-Not enough character creation components without the use of mods, too bland and uniform
-Parts of the game designs obviously feel not complete or empty when you focus on those parts but not hard for me to overlook for what there IS in the game
-Wish I could be more evil if I wanted too if I wanted to do a bad guy run, I'd like a full bad guy actual space scoundrel suite possibility


Overall from my 300+ hours of playing the game, I enjoy it and I have multiple NG+ runs. The pros outweigh the cons except the first con listed here because those issues will prevent you from playing the game to satisfaction to begin with. Make sure your PC is up to standard for what is required and do not put the game on an HDD and only SSD. I thought I was going to dislike the game at first when seeing all the negative reviews but the game in my opinion doesn't deserve all the hostility it's getting. I even got the Shattered Space DLC when I originally wasn't because I was looking for more. It is true that the DLC itself feels like it already should be in the base game but it does add some flavor to the atmosphere and it looks great.

The number one take from my time playing this game is I WANT MORE despite my current satisfaction with the game. That tells you that I really do enjoy it. Will it continue? Yes, for some time. Nothing lasts forever though but if they give me more....the longer it continues. *nudge* Bethesda, give more or I will need to Starborn your asses in the next universe when I come to hunt you down.",True,0,37596

The wonderful ""NASA-punk"" tone the game sets is fresh and exciting. The shipbuilding mechanic is by far my favorite feature.

Starfield,1716740,188936856,"As a Skyrim veteran, Starfield is exactly my cup of tea.

Gameplay wise it centres around Skyrim powergrind gameplay, where you were less immersed but focus just on the gameplay mechanics and improving your gear and character with absurd amounts of quicktravel. It ads variations of gameplay types, which are introduced in basics in Skyrim, but are all pumped up above ""it's just a skyrim DLC"".

The drawbacks are clear: Less immersion, less epicness. It's more sandboxy and you have to tell parts of the story for yourself. The different gameplay mechanics don't interlock as well, space venturing is independent from the ground combat. Exploring a planet for ressources is detached from ""dungeon clearing"" of abandoned outposts, grinding sidequest in cities/colonies is also detached from many mechanics. So sometimes you may feel a bit lost as there is not a clear and natural way of progression. In Skyrim it felt right just to venture to the horizon and explore and conquer dungeons as you go. Here you have to decide to do little 20 minute long segments of certain gameplay type. So all in all it feels less than one epic story but more like an video game.

As I like Skyrim as a whole better, I think Starfield has the better gameplay and could entertain you for a lot longer.

The complete pack for around 50€ is worth it. So grab it in a sale, 75€ is imho to expensive and there are still better games available for that price tag.

It has potential but if the real universe was as boring as Starfield, we'd all be looking to ascend to a higher realm. Bethesda may have been a bit too ambitious trying to fit the universe into a game. There's no real diversity, cookie-cutter landscapes and buildings, even the caves on each planet mostly look the same. I'm guessing each cosmic location is a stub for a future DLC. 
Overall, It's not really worth the coin until the modding community gets onboard with some real immersive content, not just face-lifts and fixes.

I don't like the Dark Souls genre, so for those games I keep my CC locked up in the deep, dark dungeon of my wallet.

It's supposed to be role playing, not roll playing. However, my CC will always break free and fly like a hungry dragon to devour the wealth of game play found in RPGs like Skyrim, Fallout, and Starfield, where I can live out great stories among varied NPCs while sightseeing fantastic scenery, without all those annoying hand cramps.

After you have visited about ten of these ""procedural"" locations, you have seen them all! 

Some missions from mission boards are locked behind pay walls, you start it but you wont get the loot at the end unless you pay! Last  time i played this game, there wasn't any vehicles to drive and the dlc had not come out yet but that wont address the repetitive nature that becomes very noticeable after 50 or 60 hours.

As for the writing, the first time i played and looted a CD player, not an IPOD, not a ZUNE or a smart phone, an CD player; that told me all i kneed to know about the writing! Its why even though the game is new, after playing for a while, it feels kind of old, and not in the good way!

Please don't say ""you can mod it"" I'm a consumer, i don't pay money to buy a game just to have to work out how to fix the game the developer was to lazy or talentless to get right them selves, even after years of updates. I play games, i don't pretend to make them.

Todd, everyone at Bethesda, and everyone out there praising this game have clearly been playing Bethesda games and *only* Bethesda games for so long that their entire perceptions on what games should be have been massively skewed. You can tell they built this game with the pre-conceived notion that it would be just as popular as Skyrim, and catered it towards the people still playing Skyrim in 2025, but without stopping to ask themselves *why* Skyrim is still being played in 2025, and what made it so good in the first place. 

This game takes the mechanics of other, better games, bundles them all together in a haphazard package, and presents them like they're novel concepts never seen before in gaming. Which I suppose makes sense if they thought their entire audience had been playing nothing but Bethesda games for the past ten years. But even if, by some fluke, you *have* only played Bethesda games for the past ten years, this game still manages to be the worst thing Bethesda have ever released. 

There is nothing remotely of note in this game. No storylines or locations that aren't bland, derivative, or otherwise predictable. No characters that feel truly unique or interesting. No standout moments from a mechanical perspective; no systems that feel novel or engaging beyond exactly what you'd expect from them. Even if you *only* engaged with the handcrafted narrative content, and only traveled to the locations relevant to the quests, you'd still find egregious repetition of dungeons and enemies, and you'd still be bogged down by bloated fetch quests and tedious missions. 

I can't believe they advertised ""1000 planets"" as though it was a selling point. I knew at that point that this game wasn't going to be worth buying. By sheer coincidence, I got a copy of this game in a deal with a new CPU, which is the only reason I even played it.

In my view, much of the criticism is accurate:
-Outside of the main quest and the faction quests, the side quests are often boring.
-The randomly-generated sites (e.g., abandoned mines / research posts) sometimes look exactly the same with the exact same loot in the same places
-The storytelling (incl. interactions with party members) is lacklustre compared to other recent role playing games like Baldurs Gate 3 or Cyberpunk 2077
-There isn`t much to discover in the cities/towns and the people generally seem quite bland
-The background you select in the beginning and many of the quests you do have no impact on the world

Despite all of this, I still like the game and would recommend it if you, like myself, have enjoyed other Bethesda titles. What I enjoyed:

Starfield,1716740,188840569,"Why create a game with so little motivation for players to be the main character?

I'm 100 hours deep and I've tried so very hard to like this game, but its hard.

1. The controller integration is only viable if I'm able to not touch or bump my desk in any way thus accidentally triggering a mouse input.

2. The ""Calling"" to the main character should have been much stronger. If ""old man Walter"" was the only NPC that could see the visions, and he was on his death-bed urging the player to take up the mantel and learn what the artifacts were, I would feel like my character had a purpose to fulfill. But Even Barrett can see the visions.  Even that looser of a member of consolation has the gift to see the visions of touching the ""shining space thing"". So the PC isn't special. I don't have a path of destiny that I need to fulfill. Why doesn't Barrett go and get the artifacts? How can the ""main character"" be the main character when NPC's like Barrett exist?

3. The freedom of game play afforded to the PC with the PC not being ""special"" or ""the chosen one"" makes the game flat. What am I supposed to do/ be? Why not act like the pirates? Why should I try to act like I'm more moral than the pirates when I'm not important to the galaxy? 

I am a story-teller who makes movies and writes novels, but this RP in this RPG is lacking all the primary compulsions for the Main Character to be of consequence.  There is no motivation to even try to be the main character. There is no mentor. There is no call. There is no reason why I want to play this game for 1,000 hours like there was for TES V Skyrim.

In Skyrim, the PC was special from the start of the main quest. The PC could consume a dragon's soul and prevent it from returning. The PC was the last of ""its kind"". The PC shaped the world. The PC could receive mentorship from the Blades or the Gray-beards. The PC had to settle the civil war. The PC mattered.

The PC in Starfield don't matter. They should have looked at The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim and carbon copied the skeleton of the PC's adventure into the universe of Starfield. The PC should have had to side with the Freestar Collective, the UC, ot the option to go ""full Neon"" and disrupt everything by becoming a ""pirate king"" of the Crimson Fleet or help prevent a civil war.

Regardless of the PC's actions, the status-quo doesn't change. The game play doesn't change. Nothing in this game matters, but it could have.

Ultimately, I regret purchasing this game; and I regret the 100 hours of my life that I have given it that I can never get back. This had so much potential, but the ""developed by committee"" killed this game before it was ever published.

Update:
I have created a new character and completely ignored Constellation and the main quest as much as possible. My current character is a member of the Hunter Alliance. I have gained the ""Mantas"" ship and I'm having fun just being a bounty hunter and being in the universe of Starfield.

Starfield,1716740,188835272,"If I could have a thumb firmly in the middle, I would.  There's some good stuff here - the NASA-punk aesthetic in a lot of areas is nice, and I actually kind of dig the conceit of the main story - but a lot of the good is buried under design choices that left me wanting something more or something different.  As an example, the ship construction mechanic is a great idea in theory - build your ship your way - but is very much let down by the interface to build said ships.  It's a finicky system, and bizarrely you can't build a ship from scratch.

Where I think the game lets me down the most is in the proceduraly-generated exploration.  I get that with 1,000 planets to visit it's not really feasible to handcraft every one, but seeing the exact same science outpost or hillside cave on a dozen different worlds doesn't really instill in me a great desire to go exploring.  For that matter, neither does the surveying mechanic, which I think is far inferior to something like No Man's Sky.  

Procedural generation also represents Bethesda really playing against their strength, which has always been their meticulously handcrafted worlds (Fallout, Skyrim, etc.).  Those worlds are full of nooks and crannies and interesting distractions that have great environmental storytelling and real atmosphere (hah).  There are a couple of attempts at that (mainly abandoned space stations, and the questline that takes you to Londinion got really close), but they're few and far between.  By and large, almost none of the locations really seem like lived-in worlds; they're just isolated hubs that send you on radiant quests to Planet ABCDEFG.

I found enough to enjoy with Starfield (clearly, with almost 150 hours) and odds are that many Bethesda fans probably will as well.  But by the high standards we've come to expect from Bethesda, it's a really middling effort.


Final note/gripe: Bethesda could stand to review their quest flow.  On multi-part quests, it was a regular occurrence to be ping-ponged between quest objectives, and not in a good way.  Do something at Location A, then head to Location B for a couple lines of dialogue that send you back to Location A.

There does not seem to be a reason for this, as I can just jump again immediately after. The only reason I can think is so random encounters can still occur. Even so, the amount of loading screens, albeit short, are tedious and annoying, especially because the game insists on showing you the same animations while also making you load.

There is clear love and care put into the worldbuilding, the design of the world and its items, the sounds, the music, the quests. Dialogues can get surprisingly indepth. The combat is exciting and it's fun to finetune the difficulty settings. In the early levels of the game, exploration is a lot of fun and very rewarding.

However, don't expect exploration to stay fun. After a while, the mask drops, content will start to repeat, and you will see the randomly generated plants for what they are - square maps with four points of interest scattered inbetween pure nothingness.

Cons:
-Visual artifacts during play: just oddities, most of the time these are experienced when trying to hold conversations with other NPC's.
-Glitchy cinematics: Even on an SSD, sometimes, not always, the in-game cinematics just don't work right. The camera wants to go one direction and the focal object just doesn't move...
-Designed for controller: Not a negative to all, but for those who prefer mouse and keyboard, a little disadvantage when it comes to navigating the customization options inside outposts / ships / homes / etc.

Pros:
-Good story arc: the first time through was a captivating arc. Even with enough side quests to sometimes forget what you were supposed to be doing. That freedom is truly appreciated in a universe as vast as the one offered here.
-Overall graphics: Does extremely well creating the random and varied expectations of visiting so many different planets and atmospheres.

Modded - playable, sometimes fun, in a casual, shallow, unchallenging and chill way ( if you can ignore / skip the bad the writing ).

What I like: ( best things first )
- making cool ships ( also a much better experience with mods )
- space fights ( only really fun with mods that scale speed better )
- shootan & lootan ( a weakness of mine, sadly )
- the locations are nice and detailed, albeit inconsistent in their use of physical & nonphysical props, also the generated locations have no awareness of the planet's environment ( snacks and drinks out in the open and no airlocks on dead/extreme env planets, etc )
- starting over with powerups ( literal isekai power fantasy, albeit it's still a terrible game if unmodded )
- almost infinite potential for mods ( unfortunately, most talent is not interested in modding this mess )

What I dislike: ( worst things first )
- 90% of the writing
- loading screens ( I recommend modding some of them out if you're on a fast system, nvme is a must )
- character design, especially NPCs ( a universe where ENHANCE exists, but everyone still chooses to look like an ork? )
- balance ( or maybe most enemies just train a natural immunity to projectiles - mods make this much more bearable )
- economy ( a SPACE SHIP can be built for cheaper than a f-ing M1911 ), by level 90 you get tens of thousands for basic fetch quests.
- bugs and bethesda jankiness ( spent a lot of chill hours decorating the atlantis apratment, at some point came back to everything stuck 4 inches deep in the ground, sighed, went into the unity, gg lol )

The games been out for a while so I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying the ""New Game Plus"" type mechanic is different and unique and offered a level of replay-ability that you don't usually get. I've replayed so many Bethesda games from the very beginning so many times to try new choices and new builds that this just felt like a natural extension of that so it was cool to see it as an integral part of the gameplay mechanic.

Yes, the game can be tedious when grinding for levels and the ""exploration"" isn't what we've come to expect from a Bethesda game in the same vain as ES or Fallout, but this is it's own thing and I can appreciate that. 

The mod support is limited when compared to some of the other Bethesda games out there, but personally I'm only looking for mods that add new weapons or armor or quests anyway, not things that drastically change the dynamic or world of the game.

Of course there are of things I don't really like, especially the combat AI.

I modded the game, actually, since many people suggested me to do so, and I am quite happy with that, since mods improved the overall experience a lot: it's like Bethesda was scared to go ""all-in"" towards a single direction and preferred modders to specialize the game; it's like Bethesda creates games like base playgrounds so that modders can actually build on top of them. 

There are a lot of mods out there, among them, along with a much needed combat AI mod which slightly improves the AI situation and others minor mods, I am using the Starvival mod, which makes the game much more ""specialized"" (as I was saying earlier) towards the survival direction, making it more challenging and somewhat deeper. 

--- Original review ---

I will update my review the more I play the game. I feel like l've just started it, even if I've been playing it for already 10+ hours.

Currently I'm enjoying it. It has some of the typical ""Bethesda-RPG"" vibes, which is something you could like or not. 
Even if I'm not a huge fan of that style (today feels a bit old), I have to say that at this time it's not bothering me at all. On the contrary, I love the atmosphere and the general feeling. Also, the game feels huge, like if it's something you could play for hundred of hours, and I believe it will be something like this.

For now, I'd rate it as a good game, and I don't get why all the hatred!",True,0,9144
Starfield,1716740,188684770,"This is the first review I've written, and given all of the mixed signals on this game, I hesitated for a long time before getting it. I will preface by advising to wait until it's on sale, mostly because $70 for a video game is still ridiculous in my book.  HOWEVER, I have somehow nearly logged 60 hours in the last week (much to my wife's ire) and I must say that I enjoyed it.  

Yes, it is a Bethesda game and therefore there are odd quirks.  My favorite is a spaceport technician whose arm accidentally got stuck in my loading ramp and went on a one-way trip into the cosmos when I launched.

Let's start with the criticisms: The open world that's not quite as open as No Man's Sky.  I really wish I had control over the ship during launch and landing, as well as space station docking. It's annoying, but you get used to it. The plot: it's not bad, but it falls flat in a lot of places.  They start really well, but then kind of taper out.  I like the characters they made, but I really with they fleshed out the conversations with them.

What I enjoyed: The graphics are beautiful, the worlds are beautiful, and the technology falls within the field of realism which I enjoy. I really enjoy how close to realism the facial expressions are in this.  The ship-building has to be my absolute favorite part.  I've spent hours playing around with my star-ship design, only for it to tell me there's a module not connected and I have to disassemble the bloody thing and start over. Love it.  I also got the nomad suit on Creations and can run around stabbing people with a wakizashi like a knock-off Muad'Dib.

In conclusion:  I enjoy playing it.  I'm also a 40 year old man with a bunch of kids, so I play at a much different pace. I'd still wait until it's on sale, because holy crap $70. But it's enjoyable.

The negatives:
-The main story doesn't seem that interesting. The game gives you side main quests from each faction way better and which i wish were the main story.
-Traveling to other planets or landing is tedious, requires you to open the map way too much and breaks immersion with the loading screens. Add to this that you don't go anywhere in space; can't go ""warp 6"" Star Trek style and slowly travel from one planet to another. You need to go through a loading screen.
-Not a lot of weapons to choose from.
-NPC movement is bad. They always go slower or faster than you and aren't that good at finding paths, which makes them get stuck often.
-Meh combat (space combat is decent). Enemies are literal bullet sponges.
-Repeating NPC encounters in space. I found the scientist asking for minerals at least 5 times, always playing the same dialogue each time.
-If you want to fully explore a planet you can't walk all the way round. Nope. You often need to go to your ship, select another biome and, surprise, another loading screen.
-Finite galaxy with finite planets + randomly generated planet surfaces with pre-made dungeons that get boring once you complete them the first time.
-Very tedious and slow to scan planets, even with the car to move faster. Special 'screw you' to whoever decided to add sea life to scan when you can't even swim most of the time due to the water being hazardous.
-No alien civilizations.
-Sarah Morgan.

The positives:
-Side quests were interesting and good. Some seen unfinished, like the one of the colony ship, but they are all entertaining.
-I dig the factions. Authoritarian government, cowboy space people and crazy religious zealots; the three very good looking and interesting lore and visual wise.
-The companions may be annoying sometimes with the constant dialogue but once you bond and unlock their missions to know more about them you get to care for them. Barrett, my beloved.
-Visually beautiful sci-fi. Space stations, ships, planets.... Exploring planets just for the visuals.
-Interesting choices when making your character regarding background. If you choose combat medic the police will thank you for your service, if you choose to have parents around they will talk about your accomplishments...

So many of the side missions are just very basic and frankly underwhelming fetch quests with little meaningful combat, and plagued by loading screens constantly. The Characters (while Character development is never a clear Bethesda strength) is very thin, and for a game that encourages you to have a crew, companions, and has more investment in them than other games, this entry feels very lacklustre and hollow.

It also occurs to me that while there are some aspects of the game I enjoy (like building a cool ship or exploring some sites) I only enjoy these because I have modded the game to optimise it. In vanilla, shipbuilding is frustrating and clunky. Scanning and exploring is time consuming and unrewarding. The world is vast but sparse, with little interesting places to find. Sure you can find a disused mining facility inhabited by psychopath space pirates and fight them, and the first time you do this, it is fun. But by the 4th time, when the facility on another planet is the same map layout inside and its the same enemies... well its just a bit dull.  You can explore all of these places, but in terms of loot... its just resources to grind into building another roof on an outpost, or ammo, or the same gun you already have, or a legendary gun that is worse than your current gun. So you end up not exploring and just blasting your way through to complete a fetch quest and then you are back on one of the home worlds getting handed another fetch quest that will send you to blast through another mining facility. Snore. Some of the faction quests have the opportunity to be great, and some of them are fun, but some of them are confusing. The skill and level up system is thin and buggy. The factions promise cool arcs but never get going. Join the corpos and conduct espionage, but actually just sneak (you dont even have to sneak) into a building and hack a terminal then leave. Maybe 1 in 5 quests is decent. the UC questline has the opportunity to be fantastic, horrible aliens, space hulk, dark and scary... but its not. Its just blasting away.

Starfield,1716740,188427688,"I realized I didn't leave a review for this yet, but I've played it plenty since launch and might as well leave one now.

I really like this game.  It isn't perfect, and there's plenty of room for polish and improvements.  However, it scratches an itch for me that hasn't been hit since Mass Effect.  Is it as good as the original Mass Effect trilogy?  Not even close.  Is it better than Mass Effect 4?  Yes, by a lot.

Even so, comparing Starfield to Mass Effect isn't really fair.  Mass Effect lacked the open world nature of Starfield, which was probably to its strength, but Starfield manages to keep you engaged fairly well, always pointing you in a new direction as you make your way through the game.  For as ""open"" as the world is, going off into the nothingness will generally be full of northing and you'll find yourself picking back up and returnign to civilization and reconnecting with the quest opertonities there.

To be fair, I've never been able to get into any of the Elder Scrolls games.  I've wanted to, and I've tried to, but the first person questing in a fantasy realm never quite clicked for me.  However, first person here, with a gun and cross hair, feels much more natural to me.  The FPS elements are solid, and the difficulty can be adjusted on the fly, with expected results.  New gun models become avialable with higher levels, bringing better stats, and the ability to mod the guns adds a limited, but enjoyable aspect to getting the most out of them.

The RPG leveling is okay.  Early game you'll find yourself making difficult choices with where to put your precious skill points for each level up, but once you start rolling and get most of the obvious choices maxed out, it feels like it becomes less meaningful.  Still fun, but more of a choice of ""that seems cool"" instead of ""oh, I need this.""

The different main strorylines range from okay to really good.  Side quests are sometimes... bad, annoying, and poorly thought out/designed, and othertimes really fun diversions.  The main lines will often give you choices to make, some of which will have a major effect of how your character is viewed within the world, but generally... things flow to the same point.

The 1st expansion is out, but I've not played through any of the content yet.  I've heard good things, and I will aim to come back and give my opinion once I've done so.

All the ""cheesy"" elements you hear about of Bethesba games are here.  Awkward NPC responces, body language, facial features, all here in full force.  The mod community had a lot a great things inplace t help with some of these before the internal creations element was added, and I've not seen most of these reimplimented in the months since, which is very disappointing to me.  Not sure if its just not an easy transition between the old way and the new official way to mod.

Upgraded PC update:

Turns out, I mostly needed a new pc to play this game.
Had a core i9 RTX3060 with 32GB ram but I was playing on a hardrive not an SSD, but still, it should be enough to run the damn game but nope, you need at least an SSD and a better graphics card. But my review is still negative because:

-I thought the worlds were completely open like in No Man's sky, they are not, there is like 5x5km randomly generated areas in the moons and planets but you cannot just drive in a straight line and end up in the same spot eventually.

-There is so many animations that just drain your life essence after watching them over and over again like getting in the pilot seat, docking, getting in and out of your ship and more that I cant remember. These animations are unskippable and they feel like they're in slow motion

-facilities, locations, and random missions. After playing for a couple of hours in the open world just bounty hunting or exploring you're going to find out that the random locations repeat so damn often it's annoying. Across stars, moons, planets. like yeah, you can have different names of locations but outposts and civilian and pirate outposts are the same every time. whether it's an abandoned mine or just some random science post or whatever, same layout, same items lying around, same locks and same findables. It gets old fast.

The bottom line: 
The game is full of bugs still. Not funny crazy bugs either, no, just annoying and progress impeding bugs that make you go back a couple save files. Will they ever fix said bugs? NO!

Starfield,1716740,188411381,"A Vast and Rewarding Sci-Fi Adventure

As someone with a long history of playing Bethesda titles, I went into Starfield with high expectations like many after what has shown before launch. After spending over 130 hours exploring its vast universe, I have to say that while it didn’t hit me with the same impact as Skyrim, it still delivers an incredibly engaging and rewarding experience—especially for those who love space and exploration.

The core gameplay loop of Starfield is still mostly classic Bethesda: go anywhere (within the box), do anything (that isn't broken), and carve out your own path in a rich, handcrafted world (or in this case, worlds). The main story is compelling, with some genuinely thought-provoking moments, but where the game really shines is in its side quests and faction storylines. From corporate espionage with Ryujin Industries to the high-stakes political struggles of the Freestar Collective and United Colonies, there’s no shortage of meaningful content to dive into. all positives even though replayability is not what is expected from a Bethesda RPG.

One of my absolute favorite aspects is the shipbuilding system. The ability to design, upgrade, and fine-tune your own spaceship makes space travel feel truly personal. Whether you want a sleek fighter, a massive cargo hauler, or a heavily armed warship, Starfield gives you the tools to create something unique. It’s easily one of the most satisfying customization features Bethesda has ever implemented.

That said, Starfield does feel like it plays things a bit safe compared to past Bethesda games. While the scale is impressive, the sense of discovery isn’t quite as awe-inspiring as stumbling upon a hidden ruin in Skyrim or venturing into the unknown in Morrowind. Fast travel and loading screens can make space exploration feel more segmented than seamless, but once you accept Starfield for what it is a structured yet deep RPG rather than a true space sim it becomes much easier to appreciate its strengths.

Also, as with any Bethesda game, the modding community is already working its magic. Mods have vastly improved customization, UI, and immersion, and they’ll only continue to expand the game’s potential. If Starfield follows the same trajectory as Skyrim and Fallout 4, it’ll be an entirely different beast in a few years thanks to modders.

Overall, while Starfield may not redefine the open-world RPG like Skyrim did, it still offers an incredibly deep and rewarding experience. If you enjoy Bethesda’s signature style of storytelling, exploration, and customization especially when it comes to building and piloting your own ship then there’s a fantastic adventure waiting for you among the stars.",True,1,8087

Those are only two of the disappointments I had to soon suffer. And I bought this at full price! Unfortunately, I alt-tabbed the game instead of closing it, so I exceeded the time limit for refund eligibility.

Starfield is not only obsolete by at least a decade, but it is uglly, and boring. All the story NPCs are ugly as well, and extremely annoying. The main story line is so generic and unengaging that I'd rather stab myself in the leg with a fork than suffer through it.
The planets look okay, but the feeling of exploration is completely wasted by the heavy use of load screens and invisible border walls.

Also, there is practically no civilization in the game. It's virtually empty. I wonder, where all those space ships are produced, because the largest ""city"" in the game is physically smaller (except for its height maybe) than the village I live in.
Kuttenberg in KCD 2 is several times bigger than all the cities of Starfield combined, and, by today's standards, much less by those of the future, Kuttenberg is still a tiny city.

I just can't bring myself to pick this game up again. I was hoping for the modding scene to maybe save it, but reportedly, modding it is, compared to Skyrim, much more difficult, and there isn't enough documentation. So there isn't really any good reason to play this game.

Starfield,1716740,188354770,"It's another bethesda rpg. if you can align your expectations for that (subpar writing, annoying characters, very same-y plots, quests, ridiculous inventory management/uis, bugs abount), and enjoy other bethesda rpgs like I do, I think you'll enjoy this one.

Criticisms specific to this beth rpg as opposed to other beth games:
* LOADING SCREEN MADNESS!!! You will need patience
* INVENTORY MADNESS!!! The inclusion of ships has made what is already a nightmare of an inventory system in these games even more confusing. Again, patience requried.
* Insane performance requirements. I have 3090 and 5950x, and get sub 60 fps in many towns in 3440x1440. Interiors run well

Pros
* I really dig the art style in this game. I feel it's the polar opposite of fallout 4 - a game with hideous and nonsensical weapons, armor pieces and more. Here of course you'll still see ridiculous designs but IMO they're visually appealing instead of ugly. Overall, I think they nailed the design language with this in a way they haven't in a loooong time
* It's a good looking game. Lights and shadows in particular look fantastic. I think faces look pretty good, the best they've looked in a beth game.
* Great combat. Better than fallout 4, and the inclusion of space stuff like dead enemies having their jump packs go off gives combat an extra dose of gamebryo-style physics fun
* Great ship combat. perfect balance of management and gunning. Just tactical enough for my tastes, like NMS with a touch more control over ship systems
* I really like the way they handle perks in this game. Perks are rewarding not only to use but also in that the way you improve them means you're playing the way you want to - it feels like you're being encouraged for playing your specific way rather than nudged to change your habits

I'm usually the type of person who enjoys blank-slate RPGs like this, but this game isn't as gripping as Skyrim or Fallout 4. The faults are exacerbated by the fact that the experience of  flying on ships vs on-foot exploration is so disconnected that the emergent gameplay is basically nonexistent. Outposts are also seemingly tacked on with no real purpose for them outside of that one main quest.

The ships which have been memed to death at this point are mildly made better with mods, but that begs the question, if modders can make your game work (and it's not even that much of a change) why can't Bethesda? Personally I hope they learn from this when it comes to their vision for TES6. Leave the randomly generated content to space sims and return to hand-crafted areas.

Game is genuinely fun for when you just want to build ships and outfit a crew (at least for me). But and this is a big but, this is not the core gameplay.

The graphics are good but character modeling is mediocre at best.  Settlements feel spartan and don't really have any depth to them.  The grinding and loot system are fair but not really noteworthy.  The acting outside of Barrett's character are wooden and uninteresting.  Gun play is on par with most Fallout titles.  Space combat is pretty average, being blown away by 30yr old titles like Tie Fighter and X Wing.  Exploration is a bit limited but stumbling on a genuinely good mission is fun.

Starfield,1716740,188306497,"I suspect this game received mixed reviews due to the hype that surrounded its launch and its promise. Did it deliver? I don't think it's a revolutionary game, but it does provide an engaging core story line with a lot of room for freedom of choice and adventure paths. It will provide you with good hours of entertainment and fun if you can get past two contradictions.

1. Does the world feel vibrant, colourful, and full? At times, but it IS spotty. One of the main issues here is the scale of the universe in relation to the scale of the settlements. It doesn't feel plausible to have such small locales in such a vast universe. It's by no means a deal breaker, but I believe this contributes primarily to the feeling of emptiness.

2. Are the characters engaging? I think we are reaching a crossroads in game development where games have not caught up in realism, i.e., providing more fluid, dynamic, and random conversations while keeping to the core persona. The legacy model of scripted static lines and dialogues could fly with Oblivion, or even Skyrim, but now, I think gamers are ready for the next step of NPC interaction. The silver lining is that the game does offer different NPC behaviours and responses based on the own player's actions and responses through the concept of affinity. That said, although the NPC interactions feel static and are repeatable, there is a lot of work that was done to provide a decent script with quality voice acting and memorable characters and interactions.

What about creativity in ship building? This is definitely one of the areas where the game shines more. Ship building and customisation is relatively easy to learn and quite flexible, and does add a really nice interactive space for players. Could it be improved? For sure, but it's a great first iteration for Bethesda on this mechanic. 

Do I feel like I'm grinding or doing the same things over and over? To some degree, but Starfield offers a good variety of mission types and adventures to take on all the while being able to pursue at the player's pace the core story line and quests. This is something that is well executed in this game when looking at it more objectively. The game also offers decent replay value by allowing the player to explore different ways to engage in the Starfield world.

Do the combat mechanics stack up? Although nothing revolutionary, they do enable a quality experience without wanting to throw your controller out the window. Nothing ever feels like it should behave a different way or respond a different way.

All in all, I can see the love the developers put into this game, and it DOES show. There is a lot of work that went into this endeavour however imperfect it is, and there are many hours of enjoyment to be found with this title, which is why I would recommend players to give it a go.

My favourite part is definitely the world design though – out of any sci fi media I ever consumed, this is the one game that feels like the most realistic ‘humans in space’ scenario.

I'm finding that if I stick to quests and avoid random exploration, I'm having an enjoyable time. Ship combat is different but not a chore, and the ship builder is quite cool if you like tweaking designs. Combat in the short to medium range is good, and I do like the perk system with the way you have to meet checks before you can upgrade each level.

Stability wise is okay,  performance reasonable,. I'm not expecting miracles graphic wise with my machine (Ryzen 5900x with 3070Ti) and I'm seeing stable frame rates on medium settings, around the 75-80FPS in most built up areas.

As for downsides - the main thing I'd say is that the game is just too plain with a safe but unexciting soul. A lot of thought has gone into building the world, but it seems flat compared to the storytelling of Fallout 4. While the area of the game is huge, once you get away from the main centres and quest areas things start repeating - especially the wide open spaces with nothing. 

This does not encourage you to randomly explore as you would have  in Skyrim/Fallout 3/4/NV.  Companions come across as vanilla, and I'm not a huge fan of the outpost building part of the game (have done just enough to store resources for crafting).

Instead, DO THE QUESTS. The faction quests, loyalty missions, and side stories are Starfield's best features. These activities will bring you to all of the unique and interesting locations, and open up tons of lore.

The main quest is more of a mixed bag... there are lots of really awesome moments and cool places to go, but it's interspersed with some very monotonous artifact/power collection. The surprise twists and intriguing plot does make it worthwhile to me though.

Starfield,1716740,188104005,"Long story short: I played through several times, wanting to search the stars for something interesting. Turns out what I was searching for was justification for trusting Bethesda to give me something interesting and complex again...

Long story: I have loved Bethesda games, Morrowind was my first and I was in love. It's not nostalgia either, I still play it sometimes. They have totally lost their spark. Fallout 4 was alright story with improved systems and was decently fun. 

This game has all potential and none of the follow through. You learn nothing in the base game about the more interesting Varun faction, they had to add it in later. The space exploring was boring, barren frustrating planets, typical storyline, and then the ""deep"" stuff in the story was just boring and repetitive. I kept buying Bethesda stuff hoping for the same wonder, creativity, and joy I got from Morrowind and Oblivion. Now I know I won't get it. I'm probably not going to buy another Bethesda game, and I am committed to never paying full price. Todd Howard went from someone I liked to the villain in my gaming life. This game should never have happened and they should have stuck to their original IPs and innovated and made them interesting. They didn't, and when ES6 comes out shortly before I die, it will likely be formulaic and disappointing too, that's what happens when all you focus on is hype and rely on your modders to make your games good for you.",False,9,15545
Starfield,1716740,188098607,"Here's the thing, if I never heard of Bethesda or even played a single game of theirs I would call Starfield ""just okay"". However since I've played past fallout and elder scroll titles, I am disappointed. I say this because I know Bethesda can really invoke a sense of exploration with Skyrim or Morrowind, and because of this I feel a little let down, especially since I got caught up in the hype. 

For starters it lacks anything resembling exploration, all it does is give you a loading screen to a ""new"" world that behaves and looks the same as any other planet. 1000 worlds...as vast as the pacific and as shallow as a coffee stain. I don't care if there were infinite planets to explore, this is not what I envisioned a Bethesda game to be. Would it have been better if they had a single fully explorable planet? A few moons? A station? I would say yes, but it doesn't really make-up for story. 
While I can easily start a new Skyrim game and play to the end, I haven't even touched Starfield in over a year, not since beating the story only once. 

In short, I would not recommend it, at least not until the community ""fixes"" it, like all Bethesda games. However with them monetizing the mods, the future isn't looking too great.",False,4,1909

Starfield,1716740,188003728,"I changed my original review from a negative review to a positive view. You might be asking... ""Why""? Well, its because of the modders. Before I would say the game is not a recommend unless you are a very specific rpg player who prefers a slow and realistic RPG, but even then I felt like there was better things out there. Now, even a original bethesda rpg fan like myself is enjoying Starfield.

Even though some would like to say base Starfield and DLC is either very bad or very good (the latter being more rare), I personally just think its average. Some parts of the game are really good and other parts really bad. However, when you play this game modded like I do then it does fix a lot of the issues the base game has and makes the game a lot better. I get mods that expand crafting, outposts, ship building, questing, gear progression, planet points of interest density, mods that add over 100+ points of interest, adds more encounters in space and on the planets, and improved enemy AI. It makes up for where Bethesda falls short. Some mods I highly recommend are DarkStar mods, Watchtower (adds fleets, orbital strikes, and a new enemy faction. By far the best mod), TG's Harvest, Gear Progression, Starshards, Standing Stones, and Wayliner. These are what I believe are core mods to have.

Closing thoughts: Overall, the game is average, but with the help of mods it does make the game feel a whole lot better. I do recommend the game if you are willing to mod it. If not, then I think you should still get it but when it is on sale. As it will still be good for a one time play through.

For Bethesda: If you really want this game to come back from the dead then we need more frequent updates that actually add content. You need to do the equivalent of a Cyberpunk 2.0 Update. We need you to not be radio silent because I'm literally about to walk in to your studio for a welfare check just to make sure you guys are alive. We also need a better endgame, more NG+ variants that are actually meaningful in gameplay, more quests that have meaningful choices that actually affect the game, a reworked starborn temple, and more unique handcrafted locations with puzzles and traps. If you can manage this with consistent updates then I can assure you the game will come back to the mainstream.

Density and variety of POIs on planets was a huge let down.  Should of been way more given how many planets they let you land on.  If intentionally designed this way for realism, this is a good example where hyper realism doesn't equal fun.

This game is not finished at all. There are too many bugs, unfinished content, inconsistencies, bugs, unfinished content, bugs, imbalances, unfinished content, bugs, bugs, and bugs.

It is weird because the graphics, sounds, animation, and FPS (not spacecraft part) aspects definitely work for a AAA game. It’s like the different departments making the game didn’t communicate with each other at all. I would compare it to buying a brand-new immaculate Lamborghini that looks stunning, but 3 out of 4 windows don't work, the radio has a cassette player, one wheel is bigger than the others so it drives wonky, the gear stick can’t shift into 2nd, it leaks oil, and the air-con is stuck on heating all the time. But hey, it's still a Lamborghini. Although you can’t legally drive it on the road because of all the problems, it still looks great — but it frustrates you like anything. That’s how the game feels.

I would rather Bethesda had sacrificed the sound, graphics, item details, animal details, animation details, and planet details — which are too good compared to the rest of the game — and finished all the content they initially planned. Bethesda definitely started off seriously when making the game, but around 70% completion, they just stopped, tied the loose ends as best as they could, and packaged it up for sale. $120 AUD for an unfinished game — not good at all. Unless they release some major update adding missing content, fixing, and balancing the game, my thumb is staying down. Also, thinking ahead to when they eventually release Elder Scrolls VI, I won’t support half-finished products and will rely heavily on other people's reviews before purchasing. I feel like they cheated me with Starfield…

SOME SPOILERS POSSIBLE FROM NOW ON

There are lots of planets in the game, and some of them have life, but all of them have resources. Animals and plants give different resources, and some can even be domesticated. So you play the game and scan the whole planet — every plant, every animal. Bear in mind, this can take a while, as some planets have different biomes, and different biomes have different life forms. You have to land in different areas of the planet to scan them all. So after scanning everything, you leave to scan another planet, and after a while, you have quite a few planets with different resources. But there’s no in-game codex to check which planet has which resources. I had to keep a pen and notebook beside me and write everything down unless I wanted to repeatedly land, find, and walk to each plant or animal to see what it gave me. That got boring really quickly...

You also can’t land wherever you want or fly on the planet’s surface, which wouldn’t be so bad if they got everything else right. When you land on a planet with, let’s say, a toxic atmosphere, sometimes you start in the cockpit, but most of the time, you spawn 30m away from the ship. Maybe there’s a pattern, but it seems random. If you didn’t have your spacesuit on before landing, you’ll start taking damage while walking back to the ship to equip it.

Moon Buggy:
Sometimes your buggy won’t spawn, so you have to go in and out of the ship to get it to appear. I like a challenge in my games, so I set everything to max difficulty. But instead of challenging, it just feels unbalanced.

The buggy is indestructible and has an 80s-style arcade boost. You hold the boost for 4 seconds, wait for it to recharge, and repeat. No fuel, no upgrades — nothing. You can view it like your ship, except the ship has an upgrade tab and a shipbuilder tab. You can boost 200m into the air and crash down without a scratch. There's no reason to drive carefully, so it gets boring really quickly; it feels like cheating.

You also can’t store items in the buggy — it has no inventory. Your follower can’t shoot from it either, even though it has no doors or windows, but they’ll still yell threats at enemies. You can turn on the headlights and honk the horn, though. The buggy is visually detailed. If you have two or more followers, one sits in the passenger seat while the others awkwardly spawn on top of the buggy as you drive.

The buggy floats on water and drives across it — absolutely ridiculous. On low-gravity planets, there's no way to add weight for better traction, so it becomes tedious to drive. Your follower sometimes says, ""We need to get this repaired,"" which suggests Bethesda initially planned for more mechanics.

Spacecraft:
Arcade-style spaceship combat… bad. Objects in space sometimes make your ship start gliding like it's on autopilot. Occasionally, you fall into a void beneath the ship, making it invisible.

I lost my full Mantis Suit from my ship inventory — that made me pretty angry, especially since I also lost some other legendary gear. On the positive side, the ship landing and takeoff animations are fantastic.

When you boost in space, the ship eventually slows down, like there’s friction… in space. The shipbuilder UI is clunky. Sometimes, invisible ships appear — just floating hatches with no body. And thruster flames can’t hurt you, even if you stand in them.

Planets:
The planets look beautiful, but the codex is missing, as I mentioned earlier. On low-gravity planets like during the Empty Nest quest, you enter a mine and suddenly the gravity becomes normal — despite being on the same planet.

If you fully scan a planet before upgrading your scanner to identify which plants and animals are domesticated, you’ll have to kill or pick them later to update the data. The planet map doesn’t show biomes even after scanning; you have to click random locations to find biome information.

Outposts look amazing from a bird’s-eye view, but resource logistics are ridiculous. You can’t limit production, and everything clogs up. If you build a landing pad, only one delivery route can connect to it, and each outpost only allows three pads. If you want resources from more than three planets, tough luck — build another outpost.

Some side quests are so poorly written. I didn’t even finish the main story because i got so frustrated. The main story itself seemed decent, though.

Other Oddities:
You can kill 15 enemies and then pass a speech check with their boss — and suddenly they're okay with you.
There’s an NPC that says it doesn’t have a gender...??!
Lots of quest glitches, plus you can steal everything from some areas without consequence.
Research mechanics are bad. If you track a resource, complete the research, and collect enough materials, the tracking doesn’t go away.
Custom map markers don’t show in your scanner view, so they’re useless.
Placing buildings removes rocks and trees temporarily, but they respawn later, sticking through your structures.
Outpost turrets occasionally vanish.
Resource connection lines are all the same shade of green and overlap, looking cheap.
Jumping forward on planets has no inertia — if you release the forward key mid-jump, you stop in mid-air. Zero-G stations are well done, but you can’t rotate your character while floating. So if enemy is right below you, you can’t shoot them as your angle of view when looking all the way down is not 90 degree it is more like 80 degree.
If you build an outpost 1000m from your landing site and land at the outpost later, you’ll spawn there — but your ship and buggy stay 1000m away. On toxic planets, you can fast-travel if you're not over-encumbered, but if you are, enjoy the walk.
There’s no way to select or track quests directly from the planet map; you have to hunt through the quest log manually.

I would say better than Fallout 4, when not using VATS, but VATS still rules. I found the stories engaging, and overall I enjoyed playing the game.

Only issues I had was fighting with the ship. Not very intuitive, plus I have essential tremors and I could not get through some fights with out lowering difficulty to medium.

I can't do that in Starfield.
You have all these planets with nothing of interest. 
I think the setting itself is the big issue, they had a new IP complete freedom to do what they want and they gave us such a bland and sterile setting.

My big issue is just the graphics style, i have a hard time seeing where the enemies are because they blend with the background. 

The loot is an issue too, in Fallout 4 everything was useful do to the scrap mechanics. In Skyrim I can tell what is decorative and what has use just by a glance. On Starfield again, it all just blends to the background.

Often mission board driven, do the job, then explore all those other buildings, take the missions to find lost miners and help out those busy scientists. It's an easy and undemanding way to wind down after work. Maybe, that's the problem with Starfield though? Too easy and too boring, unless you happen to be in your late fifties and you're looking for something undemanding, without the stress of online multi-player, where the very familiarity of the locations and the predictability of the AI, makes for a cosy certainty of a successful mission. I have to confess though, it's beginning to wear thin now.

The Game has some nice elements, twists, surprises and good set piece fights, but I'm not really sure there is enough of it. I had hopes for Shattered Space and to an extent, it delivers. A decent story, some nice locations, sexy new weapons and demanding new adversaries, but you get one planet, actually it's a moon orbiting a planet, and that really is your lot. Now the scale of Starfield is epic and if you ignore some clunky game mechanisms and a plethora of loading screen transitions, which really don't belong in this day and age, it's a decent space explorer with a decent FPS element and an okay space combat element, which keeps you coming back to design new ships. Once you have the budget though, it's going to be a very bad day if your ship can't beat anything you encounter. 

So do i recommend it? Cautiously, yes. Will you get your money's worth, I think so. Will you keep coming back to it? I don't know. If it suits you and you aren't looking for edge of the seat excitement, once the main quest lines are exhausted, maybe pootling around the Galaxy taking out pirates and delivering miners , will hold your interest.

It does have that Bethesda X factor (but diluted), is filled to the gills with (shallow) stuff to do and I get the feeling it really is trying.  Occasionally the script is funny or cool in spite of itself.  

I mean I somehow killed 160 hours playing it so it isn't all bad!

But this is one clunky game, with often awful storytelling, generic procedural slop everywhere, an AMAZINGLY poor UI that couldn't be much worse and remain playable, and Borderlands style loot.  You won't find gear that is your favourite and has good lore and a clever move-set or anything, because it all designed to be tossed five minutes after you get it for the next thing.  

The base building is awful and irrelevant and the ship building is awful and barely relevant and the resource collection and sharing system are atrocious.  

Bethesda - I'd advise dropping base building from your games completely but if it must stay, then make is useful and not atrociously clumsy.  Maybe take a look at actual survival games like Subnautica for how to do it!  

For a game that is supposedly all about exploration they fail miserably - mostly exploration is cardboard, dull and cut and paste!

It is the weakest Bethesda RPG game I have played so far (and I have played all from Morrowind onwards).  They really do seem to be doubling down on their worst design issues with Starfield though.  I hope they realise this before the next Elder Scrolls game or they may just suffer an irredeemable and damaging crash in popularity.  Starfield has relatively poor ratings and I can see why!

The gunplay is amazing, though. It's incredibly reactive and satisfying to kill your foes with.

For a game released in 2023, there are way too many loading screens. You enter your ship, loading screen. You select a planet to travel to, loading screen. You get out of your ship, loading screen. Even entering a building gives you a loading screen.

.Invest in Intimidation skill/ Manipulation Use it as much as possible makes the game more interesting.

[h1][b][u]A Beautiful but Hollow Voyage[/u][/b][/h1]

After spending more than my fair share of hours in Starfield, I can safely say the game has a lot of potential, but it’s a far cry from the space adventure I was hoping for. The universe feels huge, but not in a good way. It’s like being stranded in a vast, desolate empty mall where no ones around. Sure, there are things to explore, but every time I thought ''hey this might be exciting'', A companion wouldn't shut up with more of its pointless chatter, shattering MY immersion more times than there are stars in SPACE. And trust me, that's way too many!

A while back, I was feeling some space vibes, and since I knew Bethesda had released its expansion, I thought, ‘Let me give the game a new take, hoping for something fresh.’ After meeting with Constellation, I ended up encountering this space station, and I thought, 'Hey, maybe this will turn out awesome!' Only to noticed it was targeted towards level 35 players, and I was only barely level 18. You can guess how that went. Instead of excitement, I dried up very, very fast and it all turned into a brutal desert that had me questioning the game’s pacing. 

It felt, at least to me, like Bethesda was just throwing content at me without any real rhyme or reason. While I appreciated the attempt to shake things up, something is definitely wrong when what should have been a simple and enjoyable exploration experience quickly devolved into an incredibly tedious and frustrating grind, one that felt like an endless death trap just to get past the level gap. Moving forward felt like pure masochism, while pulling back felt weird, making everything feel meaningless either way, like nothing I did actually mattered at all.

I get it, Bethesda wanted to make things more immersive. But honestly, there’s nothing immersive about being interrupted every five seconds. It felt like my companion was tugging on my sleeve like an overenthusiastic child, desperately trying to drag me into a conversation about absolutely nothing. I’d be getting all excited about a mysterious cave or hidden shipwreck, and boom, here comes my companion rambling about artifacts, backstories, or some other random nonsense that had absolutely nothing to do with at all. It got so bad, I started trying to skip through it like it was an infomercial I definitely didn’t sign up for!

Companion and NPC dialogue intended to create an immersive, living world are repeated so frequently that it instead feels forced and becomes increasingly annoying over time.

The only time I felt a real connection to the world was when I explored in solitude, but even that didn’t last long. Space felt empty not just because of the lack of content but because the universe itself lacked a real sense of place. I wanted to feel like I was part of something bigger, an epic story in a vast galaxy. Instead, it felt like I was just bouncing around with no purpose.

Mods helped a little, but even with 145 deployed mods I can not say it was enough to save the game. Starfield felt like a dead party at times; you show up, but no one’s there. Bethesda promised updates, but it seems pretty clear they don’t really care. The art style? More “space fashion” than actual space, and the vehicle controls? Don’t even get me started. 

Speaking of which, the Rev-8's handling? Terrible. Every time I thought I was getting a grip on how the controls worked, I was slammed with a hard reminder that driving in Starfield was like controlling a tank on wheels. The sluggishness made every attempt to navigate planets a chore. To compare it to another game, the MAKO from Mass Effect was a gold standard of clunky vehicles, but Starfield somehow managed to make that look like a fine-tuned sports car.

Then, there’s the “freedom” of space travel. While the game promised it, Starfield felt like a glorified fast-travel system with combat attached. Sure, you can customize your ship, but that customization doesn’t mean much when all you’re doing is hopping between predefined points on the map. There’s no real sense of freedom, just a series of linear objectives with space.

Now, the spaceship building is where Starfield shines. You get to design and create your own ship, and the creativity in shipbuilding is truly one of the game’s stronger points. You can get into the nitty-gritty, adjusting every part of your ship to make it unique to your playstyle. However, as great as it is to build your dream ship, it’s disappointing to see that flying the space craft is reduced to a tool for fast travel rather than a meaningful part.

The promise of space exploration and discovery is present, but it’s buried under a mountain of frustrating design choices. It’s as though Bethesda had a grand vision and got too caught up in the details without considering the larger picture. The universe might be vast, but it feels empty. The shipbuilding might be fun, but it’s not enough to make up for the lack of substance.

If you’re looking for a true space adventure, you might get disappointed like me. Starfield has the right ingredients, but it’s not seasoned enough to be the feast it promises.

📜 SIDE NOTES:

[code][b]⭐ Exploration feels vast but empty, lacking dynamic content to keep you engaged.
⭐ Companion interruptions disrupt immersion and hinder enjoyment of the world.
⭐ Graphics are not the worst but the world looks very dated on this engine.
⭐ Shipbuilding is fun, but flying them doesn’t match with the limited exploration.

[/b] [/code]
[code][b]⚠️ Starfield has great potential, but it didn’t pull me in enough to stick through the entire experience. While it offers vast exploration and creative shipbuilding, the empty universe, constant interruptions, and lack of true freedom left me feeling disconnected. If you’re looking for a deep, immersive space adventure, this might not be the journey you’re hoping for, at least not yet.[/b] [/code]
[code][b]📢 There are no major updates for Starfield that address the issues I’ve encountered. While there’s potential for improvement, my experience remains unchanged at the time of writing this review.[/b] [/code]

The main story is also very disappointing. None of the ""big story"" moments ever felt like they were building to something special, while the main cast of characters are shallow and I didn't care for any of them.

Starfield,1716740,187154993,"Starfield Review: A Galactic Disappointment

As someone who loves space, open-world RPGs, and Bethesda games, Starfield should have been a dream come true. Instead, it’s one of the most frustrating gaming experiences I’ve had. After spending 150+ hours exploring its universe, I can confidently say: I can’t recommend it.  

The gameplay feels clunky, the planets are mostly empty, and the much-hyped space travel is nothing more than loading screens disguised as exploration. The cities, which should have been vibrant hubs of activity, feel lifeless and uninspired. Quests range from decent to downright dull, and the lack of true player freedom—a staple of Bethesda’s best games—makes the whole experience feel restrictive rather than immersive.  

Even as a die-hard fan of open-world RPGs, Starfield never clicked. It lacks the magic of Skyrim or Fallout, and no amount of modding will fix the core design flaws. If you’re looking for a rich, engaging space RPG, this isn’t it.  

Score: 4/10 – A lifeless universe not worth exploring",False,7,11045
Starfield,1716740,187153828,"I read a review that said “I enjoyed this game like I enjoy a fast food cheeseburger.” And that really hit home with me. Sure, I played Starfield all the way though, did all the faction quests, did best girl Andreja’s character quest, and did a ton of sides. But in after a while (somewhere in the 40-hour range), I hit the “Starfield wall” that so many others have mentioned, where I was decidedly disappointed and ready to be done. I ate my fill and looking back, it wasn’t as appealing as it seemed.

Bethesda has a captive audience for their games. I so thoroughly enjoyed the past Elder Scrolls and Fallout 3 and maybe 4 that I am a part of that audience.  But for this, I think their products suffer for it. Starfield has its good aspects, sure. It has an imaginative setting, it’s probably the least buggy Bethesda game, has good weapon variety, and I think there is some good writing in there. But man, it’s dragged down by it’s flaws and inadequacies. The RPG mechanics are almost completely gone, almost every other mechanic is worse than previous iterations, its worlds feel disconnected and unalive, its crafting and building mechanics are tedious and pointless, and spaceship flying feels like filler.

First, the good. There is a genuinely good stuff about Starfield. I like the new IP. I think they went out on a limb and crafted something that can stand on its own merit. I enjoyed what they did conceptually. I like the United Colonies “socialist dystopia” vs the Free star Collective’s “unchecked libertarianism” ideological clash. I think some of the quests tell good stories. For example, The UC Vanguard questline is legitimately well crafted and interesting. Aside from some poor writing, I enjoyed main quest as well. Also, shout out to the city of Neon for being a well-crafted in game metropolis. 

To its credit, the game has a TON of fun weapons to use and experiment with. I feel like its gunplay is a marked improvement from Fallout 4. Also, there is something to be said about the amount of content in the game. If I really wanted to squeeze 100+ hours out of it, I probably could. But aside from its setting, combat, and amount of content,  most other aspects disappoint.

I think the biggest issue with the game is that Bethesda completely gutted all of it RPG mechanics to the point where the game is not even an RPG anymore. Base stats are gone, skills are gone, leveling up is rarely exciting or rewarding. I think Fallout 4 was where Bethesda decided to begin to phase out RPG mechanics, but at least in that game we had SPECIAL. When you craft a character, all you do is you pick your first 3 perks and a background, which just offers a rare chance at special dialogue. Every time you level up, you pick a perk. And in order to make new perks available to be selected, you need to do little challenges. So sometimes you don’t even have any good perks to select when you level up. It’s a poor system and a part of the trend of Bethesda slowly eliminating the depth of its RPG mechanics. Its like “wow, I just leveled up and now I get to *checks perks* increase my ship’s shields by 10%? Whoopee.” Sometimes I just kept points in the bank so leveling up was such a ho-hum experience. A lot of perks are “required perks” like lockpicking and ship piloting. I never really felt like I was creating a “build” or customizing a character in any way.

Aside from the RPG mechanics being downgraded, almost all other gameplay mechanics are worse than previous Bethesda games. Lockpicking is now a tedious minigame where you can spend 2-3 minutes picking a lock just to get a grilled cheese sandwich for +5 health over 30 seconds. Crafting is not worth the time and effort. Cooking and mixology are basically pointless. When you crouch, your character does a “crouch animation” and doesn’t get smaller so all ventilation shafts are person sized. Stealth seems to be a design afterthought and difficult if you have any companions. Base building is less impactful than say, Fallout 4, where you can build settlements and populate them. In Starfield you can “populate” bases by assigning companions to them, but no random NPC citizens show up to be real pops. Base building as an aspect of gameplay is overcomplicated and almost pointless. Persuasion checks are an unintuitive mess that almost require you to take multiple speech related perks to navigate successfully. Status effects have been neutered. I swear one time I was frostbitten and it reduced my ship maneuverability score or something dumb like that. Melee mechanics are absent or weak. Ship designing and upgrading is horrible. I could go on but suffice it to say I am disappointed with the direction of most gameplay mechanics in Starfield as compared to other Bethesda games.

The worlds in Starfield feel unalive. NPCs do not have schedules or houses, unlike previous Bethesda games. You’ll have shopkeepers tending to their shops 24/7. NPCs never actually enter shops; they mostly just mill about. The “worlds” of Starfield are mostly made up of a few “copy and paste” locations. Fast traveling gets old and starship travel through space is limited to the space around planets and is definitely an afterthought. Support for flight sticks/joysticks is absent. Cities are the high point of the world building, with Neon being very cool. But unfortunately, many of the cities are one dimensional. Akila city is an egregiously boring place with little to no character besides being the “space cowboy town.”

Also, it’s a bad look that the core gameplay loop for the some quests is reduced to: find npc, talk to npc, fast travel to orbit, fast travel to planet surface, find npc, talk to npc, fast travel to orbit, fast travel to planet surface, repeated over and over. Like you can’t even mix it up by walking from place to place like in previous games, you basically need to pass through multiple loading screens to get anywhere. It makes you wish flying was more fleshed out and you could actually fly from place to place instead of “grav jumping” ie. loading screen ftl.

I’ve wrote enough. I mean, yes, I did play through the game and I even enjoyed some aspects of it. But I give this game a thumbs down because I feel like Bethesda is going the wrong direction with their game design. I don’t even think they made an RPG with this one. It’s a looter shooter with a bunch of frivolous mechanics you probably wont even use. Starfield doesn’t stand up to its modern competition. If you are a busy person looking for something to scratch that itch, don’t spend time on this one, just play Cyperpunk. I hope for a return to form with the next Bethesda game.",False,6,3475

There is some utterly stupid stuff, like the stranded colonist who needed help back to his ship and ended up getting killed by wildlife, all while less than 100km from New Atlantis.

I was incredibly excited for Starfield, especially coming from Bethesda—a studio known for legendary games like Fallout and Skyrim. Unfortunately, Starfield turned out to be a major disappointment. I had high expectations, but the game feels outdated, as if it should have been released a decade ago. While it introduces bold and ambitious ideas, many of them are poorly executed.

The world is undeniably vast and expansive, yet it often feels empty and lifeless. Some locations are beautifully crafted, but there’s not enough depth or engaging content to keep me invested. I started Starfield with enthusiasm, but I quickly found myself losing interest. It simply doesn’t have that immersive pull that Bethesda’s previous titles had. That being said, the time I spent playing was a blast. There were moments of real enjoyment, but they were few and far between. There just aren't enough of those exciting moments to look forward to. The game loses its pace too often, making it feel less engaging overall.

That said, there are some fun elements. Ship customization is a great feature, visiting different locations can be exciting, and the random encounters with bounty hunters add some unpredictability. The ability to hijack ships is also a highlight, and the gunplay feels creative and enjoyable.

While Starfield didn’t meet my expectations, I’m hopeful that future updates and expansions will improve the experience. Maybe down the line, with more content and polish, it will evolve into the game I had hoped for. Until then, I’d say give it a try—there’s still some fun to be had, even if it doesn’t quite reach the heights of Bethesda’s past masterpieces. Despite its flaws, I still think this is a game worth purchasing. There is something here for everyone, and I believe many players will find enjoyment in different aspects of the game. However, it's important to go in knowing that there are some significant shortcomings that may affect the overall experience.

While I do agree that free roam exploration is weak to me the problem is quite the opposite. The planets are not empty enough. You can't land anywhere on any planet or on any moon without running into an abandoned robotics lab, a fracking station, a deserted relay or a civilian outpost. Take off and land somewhere else on that planet and its the same story. The game generates an explorable area of roughly 1 to 2 square km in size and then populates it with among other things, a few bases, outposts or stations to explore. That means that every square km of every rocky planet and moon in the entire game has some kind of habitation signs on it. That is absolutely ridiculous. So the problem to me is not that the planets are too empty but that there is not enough variety in the procedural generation. This is evident in the biodiversity of the planets as well. I can't remember how many times I've seen the same twisted red vine or the same walking brain creature on different planets under different names. The terrain also suffers from the same lack of variety in procedural generation. Since every generated tile is so small there can't be any land forms larger than 2 square km and usually they are much smaller than that. This gives the impression of a mostly flat landscape with some hills and small depressions no matter where you land. Nowhere is that more noticeable than on Earth where the Himalayas have been sanded down completely while the ocean floor has been filled in. In my 120 hours of game play I don't remember to have seen a river or a volcano for example, I feel like if there had been more variety to the terrain players wouldn't have felt so bored so quickly with the exploration. Admittedly I didn't go to every planet in the game but after a while the repetition kicks in and you feel like you've seen all that there is to see already so the drive to explore further vanishes. So yeah this was probably my biggest disappointment with the game. 

My only other disappointment was also related to exploration. That was the fact that the game didn't depict the surfaces of some moons in the solar system accurate enough to current scientific knowledge. For example landing on Jupiter's moon Io I was expecting a volcanic hell. Instead I got something far less interesting that looked somewhat like our Moon. So yeah I don't know how many people care about this.

I terms of story and gameplay it was pretty enjoyable. Since I'm not a Bethesda fan in particular I didn't go in expecting I'll play for hundreds of hours. I knew from the start I'll be playing the main story, the factions and a few other side quests with a little bit of exploration throughout. So in that sense the game delivered everything I wanted.

Starfield,1716740,186661508,"I think what most gamers wanted was for Starfield to be Skyrim in space.

In a way it is, but it has none of the gravitas of Skyrim or Oblivion. It feels as if the game was developed by ChatGPT in collaboration with Ubisoft. The locations are sprawly and uninteresting, exactly what you’d expect from procedural generation. The UI is amateurishly bland. The HUD is straight out of Assassin’s Creed with how gamey it feels (enemies literally have health bars on top of them). The writing and characters are so bland—even by Bethesda standards! And the generic music is unmemorable and falls awfully short of Jeremy Soule’s masterpieces for previous Elder Scrolls games.

To get even a better sense of how inferior Starfield is to previous Bethesda games just compare Starfield’s opening sequence with that of Skyrim and Oblivion:

Oblivion: You are a prisoner in a dungeon. The emperor and his royal guard enter your jail cell to go through a secret passageway to escape a cabal of mysterious and deadly assassins. As you fight alongside them, the emperor tells you that he has seen you in his dreams and thus gives you his Amulet of Kings to deliver to his son and heir. In the end, despite doing your best to protect the emperor, he is felled by the assassins before you or the guards could stop them. With the amulet in hand and the emperor’s dying wish in mind, you leave the dungeon through a secret exit… and so your adventure begins.

Skyrim: You open your eyes to find yourself in a wagon full of prisoners. In front of you sits the gagged leader of Skyrim’s rebel faction. The wagon makes its way through the city until you get to the place where you are all supposed to be executed. You see one prisoner get shot to death by archers trying to flee, and another getting his head chopped off by the executioner’s axe. Then just moments before suffering a similar fate, a huge dragon attacks the city, and all hell breaks loose. In the chaos that ensues, as the dragon unleashes its fiery fury upon the city, you make your way through the fire and carnage into a secret dungeon that would lead you outside the city. There you see the escaped prisoners fighting against the imperial soldiers even as the city above them burns. After fighting your way out of the dungeon, you are tasked by the person who helped you escape to warn the nearby town that a dragon is on the loose… and so your adventure begins.

Starfield: Open your eyes to see a girlboss yapping about… mining. You walk in a cave, pickup a mining laser and mine a rock. Then you walk a few meters and mine a few more rocks. Then a mining vehicle opens a new passage, so you walk straight in and pick up a McGuffin that makes you Special! That’s it! No enemies, no archeological remains, no dramatic buildup whatsoever! That’s literally it! You mine six rocks, you walk into a tiny cave, you pick up a piece of metal… OH MY GOD, YOU’RE THE CHOSEN ONE!

Who the **** wrote this?!!! 

I can’t think of anything positive to say about this game except to say, it looks kinda ok. I mean the whole thing feels less like a game, and more like a tech demo of a game engine. Even though I got this game for free with my new graphics card, I still feel ripped off!",False,7,5941
Starfield,1716740,186657370,"Starfield is a game that was chalked full of potential that the developers refused to work with, resulting in a game worse than on-launch Cyberpunk. 

On the surface, it's not that bad. Granted it takes quite the pc to load anything, but we'll ignore that in the spirit of fairness. The game looks great, the dialogue is pretty good, and the movement of the NPCs definitely felt more real than those from Skyrim. (I will be comparing this to Skyrim a lot). But there's almost no depth to the game, especially if you don't care about the lore. It's like the developers didn't know what game they were trying to make. Let me dive into a handful of issues I myself had trouble with after 33 hours of playtime.

|:| Combat |:|
The combat in Starfield genuinely feels bad. All of the guns have weird ammo types and requirements, scrounging for ammo is extremely difficult because for whatever reason they decided we needed more looter in our shooter. There are melee weapons and 'guns' that dont use ammo (Like the plasma drill) but these become extremely obsolete at higher levels, forcing you to rely on guns that you do not have any ammo for. Speaking of higher levels, as you progress through the story, you will encounter higher-level enemies. You, however, will not be higher leveled. The game throws you into the story via the tutorial missions but never tells you when you exited the tutorial and entered the free-roam section of the game. If you decide to just grind through all the story missions, you'll notice that you physically can't fight against the enemies you're up against because they're level 45 and you're still level 10. This is because the game doesn't give you nearly enough XP from the main storyline. It expects you to go off and do side quests but there's 0 indicator of this, and anyone who wants to do the story first will not be able to. This ties in with the ammo problem. Imagine you're hardstuck in a mission with 0 way out (your last save is probably also in this mission, or quite a few hours ago). Your only way to get out of the mission is to complete it, but the people you fight are super high level and way stronger than you. You spend almost all your ammo just to kill one guy, only to find that he had a total of 3 damn bullets on him. Now, you might think ""Oh, why not just buy it at vendors?"" and that's a great question! So lets get into it.

|:| Economy |:|

Compared to Skyrim, I'm pretty damn certain the Starfield economy is in SHAMBLES. In Skyrim, a whole house WITH upgrades and furnishings could cost you maybe 10000 gold on the higher end. If you want to buy 6000 arrows, it'll set you back a couple thousand but that's it. Money is very easy to get, because you just loot weapons and armor from enemies and sell them. Not in Starfield. Weapons and armor sell for dirt cheap but the buy-back price is through the roof. A single magazine of 9mm ammo is almost 300 f*cking credits. Vendors barely have anything good for sale, and the few times you'll find a vendor that has ammo in the first place or maybe a set of clothing you want, you'll find that it's 2000 credits for a helmet with 1 extra armor than what you have. But your helmet can be sold for 40 buckaroonies. A similar problem existed in Skyrim but it was NOWHERE near as bad. And all of these economical problems are even more noticeable when you try to do anything with the shipbuilding. Speaking of shipbuilding-

|:| Space ships and space combat |:|
I'll give the devs credit for this one, the space combat was actually really fun. I haven't had as much fun fighting flying things in awhile. Granted, it's nowhere near as good as the space combat in similar titles (COUGH COUGH nms COUGH COUGH) but it is still substantial enough to keep someone like me entertained. Glazing aside, here's a couple issues.
THE. ECONOMY. SUUUUUUUUCKS!!! When you go to buy new ships, it is beyond expensive, and would take a couple irl DAYS of farming money to get close to. I spent a whole week of my free time (working a 9-5, coming home, playing this game) doing a bunch of side quests and long storyline parts and I could BARELY afford a ship. Which happened to be WORSE than the ship I already had! Speaking of which, why in the world is any obtainable ship gonna be worse than the one they give you in the tutorial? That makes 0 sense. The only remotely-good ship I was able to get was through a stupid long side quest, and even then the game wouldn't let me equip it until I transferred all of my stuff from my first ship into it. But I couldn't transfer it until I landed on the planet that I found it on and did it manually. It took an hour. This may have changed, it's been over a year since I played, but knowing Bethesda it more than likely has not.
When it comes to upgrading your ship, it's even worse. Starfield was hyped up heavily in it's customization of space ships, and yet you can't customize! If you want certain parts, you need other types of parts on your ship to begin with or it just won't let you put it on. And if you want parts so you can get parts? You can't put it on your type of ship anyway because the ship itself isn't compatible! BUT it'll still let you buy the part! So you can spend 40k on one singular engine (Not to upgrade your engineS, no, just to upgrade ONE of them) and then be told that you can't equip it. If you go to leave, you don't get your money back AND you don't keep the part! Isn't that spectacular? Even if you tried to get around this by going into the settings or by using mods, you can't. Speaking of mods, lets get into my #1 reason why I don't like Starfield.

|:| The Modding community |:|

Doesn't exist! Simple as. If you go to Nexus right now you will see jack sh*t that actually ADDS stuff to the game. The reason being that Starfield hasn't released it's coding stuff the same way Skyrim has. Starfield did ""recently"" get its in-game modding section that I forget the name of, but even in there you won't find anything good. All of the mods just change aspects of the game or rename stuff in the steam files because the base game is genuinely bad. Skyrim lives off of mods, every single Bethesda game is basically nothing without mods, we know this. But at least Skyrim can hold its own. You can play through Skyrim unmodded and the only major issues would be a few bugs and the awful (in todays standards) graphics. But Starfield isn't like that. The base game is just dogsh*t and makes me want to rip my eyes out. It's impossible to have fun. Even with mods, your experience will be bad, because the code isn't publicly available like it is for Skyrim, there are no mods that add anything new (we get retextures. Thats kinda it) and even the mods that change stuff in game 6 times out of 10 won't work. And it's not even the fault of the modder, the game's code is just made of fettuccine alfredo with extra sauce. I can't even say it's Dead on Arrival, this game died before they put anything on paper. ""Years in the making"" my *ss.
-----------------
|:| Conclusion |:|

As someone who tried her absolute best to enjoy this game, who pre-ordered the premium edition, who modded the sh*t out of it to try and make it bareable, I just can't recommend it. If you're wanting a space-Skyrim, you won't find it here. This game looks better, sure, but that's all it has. There won't be a space-Skyrim for years to come if this is the standard of Bethesda now. If you want a good space exploration game, go play No Man's Sky. Not only is it infinitely better but the replayability and creativity of the developers knows no bounds. Go show them some love.",False,6,1977
Starfield,1716740,186650340,"Sadly, there is absolutely no point in playing this game. The reason is simple: There is nothing to do. 

I was so excited when I preordered it. I stopped playing one day when I got tired of fast-traveling. It's a space game, after all, and Bethesda way of dealing with that is to have you fast travel between stars, and even between planets and moons. There is literally nothing to do shipboard.

The game is an endless series of fetch quests with nothing to do in between. Imagine playing Fallout 4 that way: fast travel to Concord. Fast travel to Drumlin Diner, to Oberland Station, to Diamond City. Without walking, there would be nothing interesting: no encounters, noting to look at. No quests. And that's Starfield.

I came back to it intending to continue playing a few days later, after having gone back to Skyrim meanwhile. I sat in front of my screen, looking at my ship and my quests, and realizing I had to fast travel to Point A, talk to Person X, then fast travel to Point B, ad nauseam. The encounters along the way would be a few lines of dialog. Locations would be clones of previous locations. I closed down the game and never went back to it.

I had high hopes for the DLC. I really thought they would fix things, give us a star system which they promised would be as rich as Far Harbor. Of course, it bore no resemblance to Far Harbor. It was more of the same. No new culture, no new weapons, no new outfits, no new exotic ship designs of an isolated culture. Unlike Far Harbor, it looked and played like content cut from the base game, and probably was.

I did not even both to download the DLC. I've watched and listened to the posturing of folks at Bethesda, blaming everyone but themselves for this fiasco of a result. And that tells me that this is a dead IP. If Bethesda is even capable of something like Fallout or Skyrim, they will have to prove it. Todd has dropped the ball, big time.

Meanwhile, Starfield is uninstalled and will remain so. I'm not alone. Check the mods at Nexus. It's pathetic, half what Fallout 4, a broken game produces, and a fraction of what comes out daily for Skyrim.

I've decided to write this review now just to wrap my experience up and share it with others here. I'm not done with Bethesda. Their older games remain. But I'll never preorder another new IP.",False,6,508

Starfield,1716740,186582048,"Starfield fails to deliver on expectations.  For this reason, I am not recommending it; however, I have quite a few hours into it and I still play it.  If you cast expectations aside, it does offer the standard Bethesda formula in a space environment.  Just like the Elder Scrolls and recent Fallout games, Starfield includes all the RPG elements – character customization, weapon/armor customization, followers, missions, exploration, buying/selling, top-notch voiceovers, along with strikingly beautiful graphics.  It also does a couple of things that stand out from the normal formula, including having a vast number of planets that can be visited and explored, and a ship design/construction feature.  

But first I will explain why many people’s expectations were not met.  

[list]
[*] [b]Spaceship simulation mechanics[/b]: Or lack thereof.  Starfield was very highly anticipated and many, including myself, were expecting it to feature some space simulation mechanics similar to Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, or No Man’s Sky.  Mechanics like lowering your ship to a landing pad without crashing, setting up destination plans, traversing planet atmospheres, worrying about fuel, or just in general any mechanics that require some sort of skill or minigame for space travel. Starfield instead offers a series of fast travel clicks coupled with very pretty “leaving the scene” animations – you don’t even have to point yourself in the right direction. I believe this maybe the single largest gripe about this game.  I will mention that Starfield does offer spaceship combat with all of the normal ship movements, and speed control, thrust, and weapons variation – and I’m not really a spaceship combat connoisseur, but I believe those who are, are saying it falls short the aforementioned games.  With the amount of feedback on the lack of space simulation, I would hope that Bethesda is considering putting something in the works that allows for a “simulation” mode gameplay that brings all of the above-mentioned mechanics into the game.  That would seriously be a “game” changer.  
[*][b]Limited POIs[/b]: With the vast number of planets that can be visited, you will find quite a bit of re-used points of interest.  After taking on a few missions to eliminate a “bad guy”, you’ll begin recognizing and remembering the locations, buildings, sublevels, loot locations, NPCs, etc. even though you have supposedly never been there.  With as much effort that was obviously put into the game, you must wonder why they didn’t add more locations.  So these missions kind of “dry up” after a while and become very repetitious.  I believe there are some mods, called “creations”, that attempt to add POIs, but these cost money – I’ve tried some of these, but so far, I’m not super impressed.  
[*][b]Main story is a little weak[/b]: Some aspects of the main story are interesting but a lot of it seems a little bland, and the hoops that you have to jump through to gain powers are repetitive and not much fun.  I’m not really going to try to explain why, but I found myself much more interested in some of the faction questlines and have aligned with another reviewer’s recommendation to purposely stop main mission progress after visiting “the eye”.  Another minor annoyance is that all of the potential Constellation followers are just too judgmental – about choices you make, committing crime, accidentally killing a friendly, etc.….lol.  I ended up purchasing a modded follower so that I wouldn’t be judged every 5 minutes.  
[/list]

I feel like these items are enough to hold back recommendation for the game, but now I’ll list what I believe Starfield got right.  

[list]
[*] [b]Fallout 4 / Skyrim in Space[/b]: I think Starfield does a good job at bringing the Bethesda RPG formula into a space environment.  Some of the faction missions and side missions are top notch story telling and the NPCs are done well.  The weapon variety and customization options are very satisfying and are similar to Fallout 4 in that way.    I enjoy looting and searching for “legendary” weapons and armor, and then modifying them to be even better.  You can explore multiple universes, each with multiple planets, and moons. Graphics and sound are amazing.   You can build bases on planets, set up automatic harvesting, automatic storage and automatic shipping.  The amount of stuff that you can do in this game is pretty amazing actually.  
[*][b]Spaceship design[/b]: Starfield allows you to modify and redesign your spaceship, and this aspect of the game is immensely satisfying to me.   The building system has a set of rules that must be followed to validate any changes to your ship, and it is pretty intuitive.  You can choose to change weapons, storage, power reactor, engines, docking port, landing gear, cockpit, bays, etc; Changing these will change the performance characteristics of the ship – which can improve ship combat, storage capability, defense capability, speed, and maneuverability.  You can modify your ship aesthetically so that I looks like Serentiy (on the show Firefly), or the Halo’s Pelican, or the Millennium Falcon – although I wish they continue to add more aesthetic capabilities – I really want to build a Star Trek Bird of Prey – which I would say is not possible at the moment.  I’ll likely spend many more hours just playing around in the ship building area.    
[/list]

With that said, if you are not looking for spaceship simulation, and you are looking for a good space RPG, then you may want to consider picking Starfield when it’s on sale.  For me, Starfield is one of those games that you wish was better, but I still play it every now and then because it is still “fun”.

I really enjoyed this game. What stood out the most were the countless star systems, each with environments that felt completely different from the others. The companions and the crew at the Lodge also had unique personalities that made the experience even better.

The shooting combat was simple and easy to get the hang of, which made the gameplay smooth. Exploring all the star systems feels like a huge task, though. I didn’t mess around much with Creations, and honestly, the character customization wasn’t anything special for a Bethesda game.
The main storyline was fantastic. The NPCs felt alive, and the missions were different enough to keep things interesting. I also loved the visuals—everything from the settled systems to the design of even the smallest objects was impressive. You can tell a lot of care went into making this world feel real.

The game ran great on my system (I’ll update with my specs later), and I didn’t run into any issues. The main storyline’s length felt just right, and I didn’t feel pressured to go after every achievement or 100% completion.

One thing I really appreciated was how you can build relationships with your companions—they actually felt like people, not just pack mules. The persuasive dialogue options were a cool touch, too, especially if you want to avoid combat. I also liked the personality traits you can choose for your character. I went with the “Dream Home” trait and paid the 120,000 credits for it. Now decorating my home has become one of my favorite things to do in the game.

I'll offer a solution in front of my criticism.
Introduce an ""interdimensional hub"", a player home, a cosmic temple, in which every NG cycle will be commemorated on some kind of stone petroglyph, on the walls of the temple. This will serve to tell you what ""significant events"" did you encounter during that NG cycle and let you track which guilds did you ended up leading, which major characters died, which major decisions you made. And which universe nodes did you even visit.

Furthermore, the hub will serve as a place to store your valuables between NG cycles, preserving your ""power level"" and ""hero fantasy"" as you grow ever stronger with each playthrough, just like in Skyrim where you could accumulate power and artifacts for 1000 hours.

Next - Either let us take our ship with us to NG+ (preferred) OR make the Starborne ship as powerful as a fully decked endgame ship, as big, and as useful, so that we won't ever need to build another ship again, unless we want it for the aesthetics. (Reduced toil.)

Next 2 - The Starborne temples of the ""Unity"", make them bigger, make each one different, treat them more like the Stone Dovah tablets that the Dragonborn had to find - these were guarded by monsters, in varied locations, with puzzles, behind major quests, requiring far travel and tough combat.
While in Starfield each temple is exactly the same, with the same simple (and boring) puzzle, having no challenge behind it, no lore, no beauty - it just has Tedium.

Point 2.5 - reduce the amount of time to maximize the Starborn powers, 10 full cycles is insane and 99% of players won't do it without cheats, also the powers are a let down in their own right, they either break the balance or do nothing, and maximizing them is a terrible waste of the player's time.

Now my criticism, although you got the gist already.
---
Honestly feeling let down and disappointed. Just finished the DLC.
The game is unfinished and shallow.
The core mechanic of ""resetting the universe"" for NG+ doesn't work for the ""Hero fantasy"" that Bethesda games were always played for.
This is because NG+ takes away all your items which you've been farming for hours (legendary etc), and your ship which you've been building for hours, and leaves you with nothing to even remember your playthough by.

The world is bleak, the conflict and drama are superficial, the combat is boring, especially when you're swarmed by bullet sponge enemies, totally breaking any immersion. Fallout New Vegas stands high above this game, Oblivion too, Skyrim, Fallout 3, even fallout 4.

I don't necessarily believe that this game can be salvaged and turned into something exciting. It's too shallow and neutral, too bleak, it needs less tedium and more drama. There was like 1 good quest in the game that I found, about a station where 2 times lines were mixed together.

Bonus point - Never liked to build outposts. There is no reward and no incentive, it's boring, it's a chore, and it's pointless. (Ok you farm resources. Really now. And why would you need those in such quantities?)

Starfield,1716740,186397143,"It's all of the worst aspects of previous Bethesda entries without any of the things that made those games fun.

The Story is bland and uninteresting, There is no choice, no consequences, no nothing of that sort. I don't know what else to say, It was so boring i had no interest in engaging with it. The writing is amateurish at best, Character motivations make little sense most of the time. Factions are poorly written and uninteresting, and again, do things that just don't make sense in the scenarios presented and the lack of meaningful choice really brings all that to light. One of the notable ones is when you go to the wannabe night city planet to get an artifact back, You can say you'll kill the guy to get it, but the game goes NOPE and proceeds to play out exactly the same as all the other ""choices"".

The ""RPG"" mechanics, if you can even call them that anymore, have been stripped down to their most basic possible form, There are no builds to try out, basic mechanics are locked behind perks now. Melee was just ignored by the developers, it has a singular skill, which is just a damage increase, There arent any alternative moves or swings, no strategy, its just swing madly till whatever spongey enemy you're attacking is dead.

The worlds are VAST empty swathes of nothing, with the same handful of copy pasted dungeons scattered around it, I encountered the EXACT same mining tunnel, 5 TIMES IN A ROW ON 5 DIFFERENT PLANETS and when i say they are EXACTLY the same, I mean EXACTLY the same, the loot might have been randomized in the chests, but everything else was exactly the same, one chest in one spot was an expert lock, it was an expert lock in all 5. All the loot lying around on the ground, was the same, enemy placement was the same. People gave skyrim a hard time for its samey dungeons, but at least they were all unique.

The world does not react to your presence or your actions at all, The NPC's in towns have no AI, You can shoot an inch next to their heads and it will not even phase them, They won't move, react, or say anything, nobody will. They're better described as background set pieces youre not meant to interact with, which really sucks, one of my favourite things about bethesda games is messing around with the NPC's in towns and you cannot do any of that in Starfield because the NPC's simply lack any kind of AI beyond their walk cycle.

Space exploration cannot even be called space exploration, You can't fly anywhere, its all done through menus and loading screens. If you were to omit the space flight part of the game entirely, literally nothing would change, which is an extra double bummer as we were sold on the idea we'd actually be able to explore space as well as the spaceflight mechanics being probably the best part of the game. The other thing that irks me is the game calls the map ""The Settled Systems"" in a game where you're playing as an ""explorer"". Why am i exploring already explored space? That makes no sense.

Space flight and the ship building mechanic are the best part of this game, Its fun and criminally underutilised. Its complex enough to be interesting, but not so complex like some of the simulator games out there, its a good balance, its just completely pointless as you can't actually fly anywhere.

All in all, its not a good game, you work hard for your money, don't spend it on this, Bethesda doesn't respect you or your time and do not deserve your money. If you want to scratch that itch, go replay skyrim for the 479th time, you'll enjoy it far more than this game.",False,537,1746

Around launch starfield was kind of buggy, bland, and disappointing. However, folks said that it had potential to rise from the ashes and be another Cyberpunk or No Mans Sky. 

It doesn't. and it wont. 

Cyberpunk had some really good bones thanks to its story and setting. The systems were messy, but the bones were good. 

No mans sky's bones came from some top-tier features/ideas... it just came out 3 years too early. so they needed ALOT of polish. 

Starfield doesn't even have bones. its just a big, inoffensive jellyfish. It is so bland that it would make a marvel scriptwriter jealous. more accurate - the talentless boardroom hacks that edit the scripts/story points.

Don't make the mistake of exploring random planets like you would for example the big elder scrolls open worlds, you'll probably be disappointed. Do the faction quests and side quests instead to get you hooked and get immersed, then maybe once you understand the formula go explore and look at all the procedurally generated stuff (it aint bad either). 

The companions are as annoying as they were in all of BGS's previous titles, it's just more jarring when they say things completely out of context of the situation or when they trigger every enemy around you when you're trying to sneak, because the rest of the game looks so much better.  I Personally never take any of them with me and the world feels a lot more immersive and believable because of it.

Starfield,1716740,186065846,"Starfield is a ""new"" take on the same old Bethesda formula that's been used for over 10 years. Right from the get go you realize that the game design has not advanced at all. The gameplay of this game feels incredibly dated. From the sluggish combat, to the ridiculous jumping and running, to the embarrassingly bad ship combat, everything in this game feels like it could have been done in 2010.

The absolute worst part of Starfield is it's story. The writing shown here is so terrible even compared to some of Bethesda's weaker entries. You start as a miner on a desolate planet and once you pick up a strange artifact, you are forced to join a research group called Constellation. Constellation is such an awful group, and all of the characters in it talk and act like robots. The game wants you to bring them with you as companions, but honestly they're all so annoying and emotionless that I played through the game without ever having any of them with me. Even the villain of the story is just as miserable to have to deal with. 

But what about the artifacts? What is this great mystery that you solve throughout the game? What is your reward for sitting through hours and hours of dialog and tedious repetitive gameplay? A big exposition dump. The final missions of the game try to make you understand how the artifacts came about and what they mean. You go through what is essentially a gallery of the past and learn how space travel was engineered, and then you fight the most boring final boss of all time and the game ends. This is so comically bad that it feels like Bethesda was trying to make this seem like the most boring thing ever.

Starfield was so disappointing for me on so many levels, because it's a concept that has so much potential. Traveling through universes and discovering creatures and people from all different backgrounds is something that should be fun. However, Bethesda made sure that none of it is. From the infinite number of loading screens, to the useless space combat that may as well not even be in the game, ever single part of Starfield is boring and does nothing to innovate on a formula that was outdated almost 10 years ago. This game is not worth your money or your time.

Positives:

+Companion affinity progresses just by doing missions with them, but you still get Like/Dislike points from conversations like Fallout 4
+More build options/perk choices integrated into some quest progression

Negatives:
-There doesn't feel like much reason to explore planets/systems outside of quests
-Traveling to systems without quests (which allow you to quickly select destinations when active) can be tedious
-Inventory space (personal and ship) can feel limiting without perks if you want to explore a planet and hoard resources

I can see that a lot of work clearly went into this game, but it's glaringly obvious that either, or both
[olist]
  [*]Bethesda was not making a video game; they were making the template of one, by which they could sell you mods via microtransactions to fill out the husk.  
  [*]Nobody working on this title knows what makes a video game actually fun, or engaging, or enjoyable to play. 
[/olist]

Support from updates, consideration for modders early on (lul), and managing to deliver a solid DLC may have been enough to save the game if they had made major course-corrections in their launch window, but Bethesda seems to only be capable of doubling down when confronted by their community, and then following it up by providing further proof of their incompetence. It's looking like the ship may have sailed, unfortunately.

If you're on the fence, or got FOMO, I would recommend just picking up game pass for a month first instead, to see if you can sate your curiosity, get bored, and check back out. You may end up saving yourself some cash. Otherwise, wait for a deep discount of [i]maybe[/i] $35. 

--Full review below--

[h1]A Bethesda RPG only in name.[/h1]

It can be fun if you want to wander in a sci-fi space setting and halfway pay attention for a long time. 
I play this game to get sleepy.

The problem this game faces is that, at every possible opportunity, there are parts of gameplay that will suck you out of the world, just as soon as you feel you might actually be starting to be immersed or connect with... [i]anything[/i] in it.
[list]
  [*]Non-insignificant amounts of tedium
  [*]The graphics range from gorgeous to potato, and everything between, but the optimization has been (and continues to be [even though it has been improved]) hot trash, so you're likely going to have to heavily rely on upscaling, and then still get persistent framedrops that you can't really do anything about in most of the main city areas, which you have to spend time in for the main quests, because even the best CPU's in the world (7800X3D-9800X3D) can only manage an almost consistent 120 fps. My 7600X tops out in the 80's, which -don't get me wrong- is very playable, but if you're someone that usually opts for high framerates, the headroom just isn't there, and in demanding (read: unoptimized) areas you still run the risk of it bringing you out of VRR territory, unless you have a monster build [b]or[/b] you kick on frame-gen.
  [*]There are so many characters that seem like they should be cool and compelling, but the writing is so laughably bad and shallow that you just want them to go away. All of them.
  [*]The guns generally look and feel nice, and the sound design is pretty alright, however, upon further inspection, you'll notice that these are guns that were clearly designed by people who don't know how guns work; and not in like a ""sci-fi write-off"" kinda way either. Like, these firearms just don't make physical, mechanical sense. I'm not like a gun-nut either. This is the first time I've ever actually been distracted by how nonsensical the guns function in a video game. How do the people in charge of making gun models and animations not know how a shotgun slide works??? That's like 101-level stuff.
  [*]Space ship flying and building is really cool, until you realize that spaceships are usually just a portal to your loading screens. You can fight pirates, shoot rocks, or initiate loading screens.
  [*]Planetscapes can be beautiful, but they are quite empty. I was pretty okay with that, until I realized that every landmark on a planet that actually [i]is[/i] there, is just a copy/paste assortment of prefabs and POI's from a basket of like 20, all spread out about 500 meters from one another. And this shouldn't be a problem. The way the system is designed leaves so much potential for this wealth of surprise, unique POI's at a consistent pace. I don't get why you'd design the game to randomly generate stuff like this, and then not leverage it to keep a consistent stream of surprises for the player. One of the major benefits of designing it this way is that it gives the devs so much control over pacing, but like just about everything else in this game, the potential goes to waste. The rover goes a long way to alleviate the problem, but it doesn't solve the lack of variety. If anything, I imagine it just speeds up the amount of time before you've ""seen it all"".
  [*]Quests range from neat to meh. Nothing to write home about. They all essentially exist to make you go ""wow, yeah. space is cool... and dangerous... uh-huh"". There were some fun little moments here and there, but just never enough to feel worth my time.
  [*]Crafting and basebuilding... *sigh* Yeah, it's there, alright. Some of the systems are streamlined, some are [b]not[/b]. If you are the type of person that likes making mega bases just to generate one schmillion gargletite, and intricately link your gens and cargo tanks so that it can be distributed to planet Zornon, for no other reason than to get it there, then sure: I imagine you might possibly enjoy this part - and, come to think of it, maybe even this whole game.

To start, character creation is well done. You are able to design just the right appearance for your character and will likely spend a good deal of time doing so. It is a bright spot in a game with too few of them.  

Once your PC is created, you enter a soulless world of planets. The random NPCs that populate the cities appear to have been designed by random generation from each possible option in the character creation menus. They wander aimlessly, at zombie-like pace, and stare at you bug-eyed as you walk past. Most don’t even have names, just “citizen.” Style is gone in the future, as their outfits are shapeless and boring. 

Conversations with everyone, whether they are random or part of the main quest, are the equivalent of those that you would have at a corporate staff meeting. They are short, superficial and extremely polite. There are typically three dialogue choices for the PC in every conversation - a polite vanilla response that keeps the quest moving; a humorless, snarky comment; and a third that asks for more information. The option to keep the quest moving is typically the best, because the snarky comment is ridiculous and more information from any NPC is never that interesting. City guards occasionally make rude, unsolicited comments regarding your background. Persuasion is baffling. A persuasion situation can appear to be going your way only to fail for reasons that I still don’t understand. Also, persuasion situations allow the NPCs to continue a conversation, which becomes more banal as it progresses.

The User Interface is cumbersome. Moving around requires multiple stick movements and button pushing. Also, it is difficult to compare items and their usefulness. Normally I do not like to mod a game until I have played through it first, but I did download a UI mod from the nexus just to eliminate the frustration of the existing UI. 

Finally - Gameplay.  The Main Quest is tedious and, as far as I played, represents a series of fetch quests. I did not join any faction because the “Faction Recruiters” were unexciting in their offer. I tried ship modifications, weapon and suit modifications and research - but there was nothing fun about it. Combine a couple of things, press a button and there you have it. I got to the point where I just didn’t want to do much because the “reward” didn’t match the burdensome slog of obtaining the necessary items. Even the cities are so poorly designed that you don’t really want to explore them. I mean, it is the future. If we want to speak with someone, don’t they have a mobile phone? If we need supplies, doesn’t anyone deliver? 

So, overall, I cannot recommend this game. I am going to continue to play on and off as I really want to like this game. I think I will try to investigate and download some mods and start another playthrough, seeing if the mods help. It may be great in a couple of years, but right now, it is just a time dump.

If this was released 10 years ago it would be great, now its just an average game that will make you feel bored quickly. Why? Because it has nothing really unique to offer unfortunatelly.

Long version:

Visuals: The best part of the game. I love it all. Planets, ships, people, weapons, buildings, nature  all of it.
Audio: The worst part of the game. There are so many different sound effects that it blends into one awful noise. Music is average, voices are ok.

Gameplay: As a proffessional analyst, amateur programmer and a veteran game player (understand, since Golden Axe and such lmao) I do not consider technical bugs a big deal. It happens, it should not with budged like they have but I am more concerned about the game it self anyways. 
 Even as mentioned I play games since ever, I was always a guy who need to play at the lowest difficulty as I am really poor at gaming. So that was really big surprise to find out that the main story and many many other quests can be done without spending one single skill point. In many ways, the skill tree looks pretty useles. What you can not do you hire a crew memeber for it, what you can not manufacture you buy it. So the main RPG feature (leveling a character) is unimportant, which is crazy. Next they say this is exploring game. Well I do not consider visiting same looking places with different names exploring. They call it FPS. Well I spend more time to actually get into a shooting than the shooting lasts. 

 What I really miss and what i expected from new game like this one is this: 
 I expect that when i join a faction i can progress through the hierarchy and come to the top and each rank will give me some advantages or new options (quests, arms,..., whatever). I expect my actions will do some reactions with the world, if i join someone, somebody else will hate me for it and such. There are different factions in the game but you dont really rank up and it does not affect the world around you. 
 I do expect that every character is killable as it was in Arena or Daggerfall too i think. And if the character was necessary for some mission so let happen with the mission something. End it, or allow the mission to start with another character or open the possibility of starting a brand new missions and so on. 
 I do expect all actions will have consequencies. This is way too linear and BORING. 
 I do expect to have some market in such game. With goods, arms, real estate, whatever. 
 I do expect that if i attack big producer of iron it price will go up and will be difficult to buy and if i protect a planet producing foods, they will be abundant everywhere and so on. (consequencies)

Starfield,1716740,185557853,"I've never written a Steam review before, but I felt like I had to with this game. I don't think I can say you shouldn't play this game... its a big Bethesda title with a lot going for it. I think everyone should take a chance and experience it for themselves. I knew what the reviews said before I bought it (I waited til it was 50% off) but I couldn't not try it always wondering whether I would feel the same way.

BUT

That being said, I COMPLETELY agree with the large majority of reviews and feedback from the rest of the community. The game has an interesting main story and builds on (or recycles, call it what you will) a lot of the RPG mechanics seen in previous titles like Skyrim and Fallout. I liked the combat overall and some quests were really enjoyable.

However, right up until the end when I uninstalled this early today, I was forever frustrated with the complex multiple-layered menus, immersion breaking loading screens and boring exploring component. There are so many unnecessary complexities, too many key binds, etc.

Most AAA RPG quests involve some combination of ""talk to quest giver > travel to place > combat > fetch item/information > return to quest giver"". In Skyrim, part of what made it great is you get to ""travel to place"" and before you know it, you've come across some random cave, or found a beautiful village, or a fort with enemies to distract you, or you speak to the guy in the pub on your way out and wake up in the temple of Dibella with no memory of how you got there...

Starfield doesn't have that. When you land on a planet you have to consciously seek out places of interest if you're going to see anything (and even them most of them are cookie cutter locations like 'abandoned mine' or 'thermal pools' - to the point where the enemies and clutter are in the exact same locations). I also got so sick of the menus and 5+ loading screens just to get into my ship I resorted to hold the 'fast travel to quest marker' button every time I wasn't where I needed to be. The fact that button exists shows the developers realised they needed a faster way around the fact they weren't able to build a game that allowed seamless travel between quests. In reality, there just isn't a lot out in space that is exciting.

These issues extend into all the other features they built into this, like the outpost building, equipment upgrades, research etc, which were so painful to progress because of the sheer number of different resources required conflicting with the low carrying capacity. I get to my outpost only to realise I don't have some random item needed to build something and find out I'll need to progress through a bunch of cut scenes/loading screens, shop vendor menus etc to get the item and back again - it is not worth the hassle or the time.

I also played this game immediately after HFW which was such a beautiful open world, great characters and stories, and while it is a very different sort of title, really highlighted the level of quality and detail I feel is lacking in Starfield.

Call me a Bethesda sheep - I REALLY wanted to like this game. I really wanted it to be immersive and repeatable (NG+ is sort of forced on you at the end of the main quest line). But at the end of the day its something I glad I played once, just to know I never need to play it again.",True,19,8916

I haven't really had any large bugs or game breaking experiences as of yet.  The game has been fun and entertaining for me so far.

My Pros for this game are:

 - A pretty good amount of planets and systems to explore and survey
 - Building and Customizing your own space ship. (Gain certain skills to unlock unique ship parts)
 - Build your own outpost like base on a planet.
 - No planet maps are really the same and locations on planets are randomly placed depending on where you choose to land
 - Space Pirates and the chance to become a space pirate in the game


Some of my Cons for this game are:

 - Life on planets should be more abundant and diverse.
 - Its way too easy to make money in the game early on.
 - Weapon customization and diversity seem to be lacking.
 - Some modules for ship building should be able to rotate to give better ship customization

It's nice to see some (mostly free) content added by Bethesda in the Creations menu also; (new quests, another new vehicle that has a missile launcher, ships, interiors, weapons, armour, outpost furniture)

[h3]As a player, I would be more conflicted.[/h3]
Oblivion, my favorite Bethesda game, launched with game-breaking bugs and to this day suffers from a save-game bug that will cripple your character save and render it unplayable. This issue persists almost two decades later.

Skyrim, closing in on fifteen (15!!) years since launch [11/11/11] had similar issues - Bethesda overpromises, underdelivers, but the open world and customization options provided by the Creation Kit (or GECK, for the Fallout fans) allow for a nigh infinitely customizable experience. TES VI will likely be met by a similarly critical eye - justifiably so, mind you.

That being said, there are no space games on the market that allow for the breadth and depth that Starfield permits. Star Wars games, solid or not, keep you bottled up in that universe. The Outer Worlds, a game from the Obsidian team that brought you F:NV, faced problems not unlike Bethesda, where the scope of their goal crept out of their reach throughout the dev cycle. Starfield, being created through an unprecedented global pandemic, ran into similar problems.

These several paragraphs serve to contextualize the game itself. It faced close to Half Life 3 levels of hype, and could only disappoint (peep GTA VI when it drops). CDPR faced similar challenges when it hyped up CP2077 (a rig-melting garbage heap with the skeleton of a good story/world underneath at launch, now touted as an elite cyberpunk RPG{still clunky, but buy it}).
Is it a perfect game? Absolutely not. Is it a good space exploration FPS? Yep, let's ride, space cowboy.
_____________________________________________________

The characters? Moderate to insufficient depth.
The world? Decent, plot holes if you think about the science too much, but it's space fantasy.
The gunplay? Bethesda bullet sponges still exist, but the base gameplay is alright.
The story? ""You're the Dragonborn/the one from my dreams/the Sole Survivor/etc"". It's cookie-cutter Bethesda protagonist. 
The polish? Surprisingly good in some areas, lacking in others. 
The updates? We got buggies for driving, and space serpent cults for finding. 7/10

I liked it, then when they let us loose with Creation Kit 2, I loved it. A space playground with all the hard work done? We don't have to build a space game, we can just use the knowledge from previous Bethesda mods to change this one to our hearts' content? Hell yeah. It can be anything you want.

[h2]Verdict? [/h2]
It's fun, albeit flawed. But if you flip the release order with Skyrim, we're here arguing over the Hearthfire DLC and the amount of bugs it introduced. I grew up on the early 00's games, and everything nowadays is a marvel of technology compared to what I had to work with as a kid. It's like turning a kid who had one box of standard Legos loose in the primary Lego store. So maybe the jaded attitude coupled with my age has led me to enjoy this experience more than one should.

Is Starfield the best game ever? No. Is it the best Bethesda game ever? No, not even close. But that said, Starfield is a unique experience. It’s great when you accept it for what it is and play it for what it has to offer. It’s a relaxing game, and you can see the Bethesda magic behind all its flaws.

The extra option are obnoxious and seemed designed to mess you about when you do things by the instinct you built up with their past titles. Also the ""press vs hold"" button design is a pain as you can press a button, have nothing happen, then you hold it down and it makes you get up from the pilot chair in the middle of combat.
If you can look past these, there is a bunch of stuff to do, but don't expect the game to grant you full agency. Some things that should be able to be bypassed by Persuasion checks don't seem to be, and the the skill system seems to be deliberately obtuse, so you have to fumble around with your precious skill points to try and figure out what lets you do what you want to.
Writing isn't as bad as some say, and not as good as others say. 
Overall, it isn't bad per se, but it does feel like it is in need of major overhauls to make it less irksome.

+Less buggy than any previous Bethesda experience.
+Randomly generated terrain looks very good compared to other RNG planet models (ED, NMSky, etc.)
+Satisfying looting.

-Requires modern hardware to streamline load screens, and present accurate lighting.
-Has slow immersion breaking voice acting.  Actors don't seem connected to their scenes or characters.
-The writing is also lazy:  When so much coming from the characters voices is just filler it sucks.

EXAMPLE:   ""Hey aren't you that guy that flew in on the ship""  ""I KNEW it!  I was right about you being the guy that flew in on the ship!""  ""Is it your ship?""  ""Really""  ""I just can't believe it's you!""   ""I've been looking all over for you, and recognized the ship as it came into the port.  I noticed the color and call signs and was like, Hey I think that's them!""  Turned out I was right, and now I can finally ask you what I've been traveling all this way for.  ""But before that let me just congratulate you on landing your ship here in front of me.""

Guy could have just said:  ""Thank the stars you finally landed!  I need to talk to you!""  For all I know they just asked AI to take what they were saying and just make it use more words.  So strange and lazy.  I'm getting tired of hearing the question ""Is that right? or Really?""

Skyrim I turn off subtitles so I can get immersed, Starfield I turn them on so I can skim over all the crap.
Most of the mission givers act like they don't know how to do their own jobs.  It's almost like writers that have never had to do anything but writing are trying to figure out reasons that people would need to do other jobs and failed to understand it.

I like crafting weapons and gear.  I like bounty hunting, mining, building.  I like not having game breaking bugs.

That being said, I would actually go crazy playing this game if I couldn't skip redundant dialogue.  I've lost count of how many times I've actually said out loud ""OMG get to the point.""

This game is not broken. It's not empty. It's not overly-infested with loading screens. Does it feel a bit out of date as an AAA game? Sure, but anyone playing a Bethesda game knows and is [presumably] okay with that. It's a modest technical and graphical improvement over Fallout 4 that has a similar amount of hand-made locations, a huge bevvy of side quests that vary in quality, and tons of flavor text to find that flesh out the world. The addition of a really fun ship-building mechanic is a lovely bonus that I've sunk a ton of time into.

Procedurally generated content and New Game Plus exist on top of what is a fully complete game in order to give career grinders and replayers a bit of extra spice in their playthroughs. Expecting those things to be as fleshed out and detailed as the totally normal-sized base game is, frankly, absurd. All the people leaving vitriolic reviews over that stuff should be ashamed of themselves for getting so upset at a problem of their own making.

So, TL;DR: If you're someone who enjoys NotSerious™ gaming, have some fun with this (especially with mods and [i]especially[/i] with amazing creations like that Star Wars-themed total conversion modlist), but FOR THE LOVE OF ZAPHRAM COCHRANE GET IT ON SALE.

Because this result of scope creep is the perfect example of what's wrong with AAA gaming these days, but somehow still manages to be an insult to it.
After comparing it to other space adventure games like Star Wars Outlaws, No Man's Sky and the great indie game Everspace 2, after comparing it to another recent Western ShooteRPG, Cyberpunk 2077, and especially after comparing it to the over fifteen years old Western Space ShooteRPG Mass Effect, I've concluded that this game is so unacceptably outdated and limited in its design, it would be funny if it weren't so sad.
Oblivion in Space WOULD have been great... If it had released around the time Oblivion released.
Yeah, Bethesda, it's great that you have a whole galaxy arm's worth of accurately modeled and scaled planets... BUT THERES NOTHING TO DO ON EM.
The atmosphere (or lack thereof [GET IT?? GET IT?? SPACE PUN!!

And it's not like that can be blamed on the hard sci-fi setting, you can still come up with stuff.

In retrospect, Bethesda's Devlogs on this game show what really went wrong: Yeah, cool that you know and care about the nonsense that players get up to in your games, but those things are fun precisely BECAUSE they're not part of the intentional design.

I would understand a level of tedium in a resource management game, but everything regarding resource management is so half baked. 

""Space is supposed to be empty, that's what makes it so immersive"":

1. I'm not going to Space, I'm playing a Video Game
2. There's nothing immersive about a loading screen
3. Not once did I feel like an explorer, because everyone has seemingly discovered everything JUST or RIGHT AFTER you get there
4. The emptiness does nothing to serve the game's Sandbox claims because there is little meaningful variety in player choice (What if we made Fallout NV's class system and Fallout 4's melee combat SUCK?)

""Gamers want shorter games"":

Gamers want engaging games, regardless of length. I don't know how the entire quest is based on looping over and over, and barely anything changes. You can literally feel the ones and zeros of each new universe's variants, and somehow you very rarely can change the outcome of any quests based on previous universe's knowledge. Also how short can y'all claim it is if there's 1000+ planets and like 9 of them are fun.

If you just want to turn your brain off and play a silly little game there's a lot of good stuff (ship building, base building, standard Bethesda quests, etc.) but beware that not only are those things done better in several other games, but done better in previous BETHESDA games.

It exists almost solely for the people who are looking to share silly anecdotes with their friends and not think much further (see HMS Platypus)

Anything outside of actual landmarks are procedurally generated, so alot of repetition on the worlds.

Or you can just fast travel from place to place after initial discovery like any bethesda game.

and other funny quotes from Starfield. Well, let’s wrap this up:

I somehow finally finished the game and overall I wouldn’t recommend it if you’re not a Bethesda Fangirl. (And even then...)

Why? 

[b]Story:[/b]
- The game fails to set up a meaningfull and engaging plot. The first few hours are nice. You start as a miner and eventually get to know the people of Constellation: Explorers who want to get to know the universe better and apparently collect some Artifacts, one which you already stumbled upon. But it gets worse after that.. 
In Skyrim you are thrown into a conflict between civil war and dragons, in Fallout 4 you are on a quest of revenge, in Fallout 3 you’re looking for your father. Here… All that drove me was my curiosity – and a lot of loading screens on a spacemap (which really doesnt make things easier). 
The plot immediatly turns into a very basic „fetch the artifacts“ quest after a while. You don’t get more insight into what they are or who made them. 
There is little tension in the plot. The Starborn attack you (apparently) out of boredom. When one of your friends is killed this is the only part where things got a „little“ bit emotional, but on the other side it also felt hollow because you lost them for nothing other than the fact that Starborn exist. You learn nothing, you’re just left finding the other Artifacts. My problem is that none of the other factions are involved – no one but Constellation cares about Starborn, not even New Atlantis after they were attacked by the Hunter. Wtf? the main plot feels like it exists separate from all the faction quests (none of which have any influence on anything).

Spoilers ahead: [Spoiler]It’s a multiverse story with the goal to leave this universe (because of boredom.. or curiosity.) I find multiverse plots difficult because it makes the events of the current time and being feel irrelevent. Sooner or later it becomes very obvious that nothing you are doing that isnt Starborn related narratively matters.. so why bother helping Andeja with her side quest at all?
There is also no resolution in the end oft he game. You never find out who made the Artifacts, what they are or why you get powers through them. (The powers feel terribly copied from Skyrim, too.. really Bethesda, first I am a Dragonborn and now a Starborn?) 
 
It would have been sooo much more enthralling if the writers had used some of their further introduced factions to fight over the Artifacts and not the Starborn. Imagine the Va’Ruun wanting the artifacts because they thought the Armillary would create a doorway to the Serpent? [/Spoiler]

Iit would have been even gripping (not even us, the player) would KNOW what the Artifact actually do: The final revelation would have been a surprise to everyone! 

The faction quests could have mattered at this point – and to our companions, too! 
By the way, those always felt out of place..
Apart from a few very inappropriate moments in which the companions were annoying (I'm currently in the middle of a fight against a fat terramorph but Andreja really wants to talk to me about her family! Really? ) they felt like something Bethesda added to have at least some part of bonding going on. but they really just seem like programmed robots that run after you and shoot every now and then.

[b]Writing in general (Characters/other quests):[/b]

I couldn’t really enjoy the faction quests, even though I never had problems with that in other Bethesda games. Starfield just never hits a button. I’ll take the Crismon Fleet Questline as an example because I think it could have had so much more potential!  

The characters in the Crismon Fleet are pirates – and they could have been charismatic rogues, laughingly planning clever break-ins. They could have been people who had to deal with their past and had mistakes but also some heartfelt moments that made them real. Or they could have made them anarchists, fighting against the expanding system. Following a charsmatic leader that promised them a better political system.. 
But instead Bethesda chose to make them assholes. In a pathetic way. People who only care about money and greed. They are portrayed as people who just insult each other and I kept wondering why everything isn't just blowing up here. 
In the end you have to choose how you deal with them.. but the way they are shown is that much black and white that it the choice here was easy. A pitty! I would have liked to become a space pirate so much!

Other than that the quests feel so.. unrelevant? Most of them are fetch quests and I rarely encountered meaningful people. Everybody feels so copied or “made up”. 

The cities are not very unique, too. Neon is a very very bad copy of Night City, New Atlantis is as interesting as very diluted peppermint tea (and not remarkable at all), Akila city COULD be in a Star Wars pilot episode.. if it were to be taken more serious, because the ""danger"" everyone always talks about there is but a few biting kangaroos on level 4.

After a while I realised all the quests that were thrown at me were meaningless „get me xy“ quests which made exploring the universe so much less fun. 

[b]Other things that made me dislike the game:[/b]

+ Ship combat. Like a super bad 3D simulation at the fair. Ship upgrades are expensive, tiring, and somewhat annoying to obtain. I avoided the space combats as much as possible.
And who decided that it was okay to put “E” for hail (another ship) and “press E slightly a longer time” to stand up and leave the cockpit ON THE SAME KEY? The cutscene for that is incredibly long and my ship was blasted more then two times during that. Well.. maybe I’m not cut out to be a captain.

+ Explanations:  ship building, upgrading..was something I had to find out for myself. 

+ My crew only stood around while being on my ship and stared wholes into the universe. Can you, please, just once, do something that HELPS me?

+ After exploring 10 planets I started to find copy pasted stations. Wandering through abandoned places was always something I absolutely enjoyed in Fallout. but here  it feels meaningless. the little notes of the people who left their traces and memories there. - It's rare to find anything like this here.

+ Landscape is disappointing, too. The planets almost all look the same. Forget unique flora and fauna. Sure, you can scan and study everything... but that's just an endless fetch quest.

+ The temples feel soooo boring! I have to keep doing the same thing over and over again? It’s not even a puzzle! There’s no story behind the temples, nothing to explore!

+ Companions (again).. somehow Bethesda liked the idea of quantity over quality and it really shows. I met some of the people outside of constellation and they all felt uninspired and boring. And the people at the lodge... well, they were a little better written but I'd still rather run around with Dogmeat if I'm honest. These rigid facial expressions don't really help and the one short personal quest you get with them feels  is completed super quickly.

+ Sneaking should be forbidden as well, especially if you have somebody following you.. 

[b]TLDR: Please don’t buy this game. It’s not worth it. [/b]

Play Mass Effect if you want a unique story and emotional characters. AND better exploring, too.
Play Outer Worlds if you want (a similar gameplay) a funny story with unique dialogues. Play Borderlands, if you’re in for the loot and the shooting. Play No mans sky if you want better exploration. 
OR just play Cyberpunk 2077 if you want a wonderful and unique story.  Well.. 

If this game would have been published 10 or 15 years ago I might have liked it slightly,  but nowadays it's kind of embarrassing to publish something like this and comment under other reviews with [i]""The astronauts back on the moon weren't bored when they found a stone landscape!”[/i]
Please get better, Bethesda. Or stop trying.",False,13,3928
Starfield,1716740,185378762,"It’s a good game. The dialogue is a little bland and sometimes very strange like one second your just friends with a companion then the next line you’re saying you love them and you can’t imagine life without them lol I mean fallout 4 was the same way pretty much. I really really really enjoy this game there’s a lot to do. Like yeah sure a lot of the planets are barren and empty but most of them have atleast ONE cool place to visit on them. I’ve gone to a planet that I thought nothing was on and next thing I know im 2 floors deep on a giant research facility unlocking the mantis ship which I had no idea was there. Or like paradiso helping or blowing up for no apparent reason a colony ship with 200 people on it that have been in hypersleep since before earth collapsed. I really just suggest trying this game yourself catch it on sale and give it ago it really is a beautiful and really fun game. There’s a little bit of choice in the main story and the main story itself is a little rushed and whack and doesn’t make a lot of sense but the side stories are what have me hooked you could do a playthrough without even touching the main story and you’d be doing over 220 side quest before even starting the main story you’re talking hours and hours because some of the side quest are insanely long with a lot of parts. You can do so many things in this game you can literally get a normal job as a chemist, a bounty hunter, work for the UC core, the role playability is wide as hell. Sorry to ramble on and on there’s just a lot to say on this one and I know it gets a lot of hate I just hope the people who are on the fence about it decide to try it and love it as much as I do! If you don’t agree that’s okay too that’s why we have so many different games no one is going to agree on every game",True,4,4657

Starfield,1716740,185370004,"I really like the game and I also can see why there's a lot of down votes too from people that have lots of hours playing it. For me some of my dislikes is the (optional) scanning of the planet for resources, flora and fauna, etc. The reason I don't care for it is because the player has to scan the same thing multiple times to achieve 100 percent, and to me that is monotonous. Why NOT scan each different thing only once on different planets?! Forget about doing the Constellation mission board, I started one of the missions and gave up about 95 percent into scanning of the planet and I haven't had the desire to go back to check the board again, but to each their own, they say. I'm also disappointed with the copy paste facilities and caves but that's if you're doing lots of the board missions (which I had to back off on playing them). The likes: I've enjoyed most of the stories/choices so far, and I really enjoy crafting my ship(s) along with getting into dogfights. I'm also starting to enjoy building outpost too, but it's quite the process leveling up to have more options and choices.

Oh, I don't think it's a fair assessment from people with less than 10 hrs. of game play giving down votes to a game that's monstrous in size. My first purchased I refunded the game in less than 3 hrs. because the game just overwhelmed me with taking in so much all at once but I did not down vote it either, and when I repurchased the game again about a month later it took me around 20 or so hours before I started to really enjoy the game, and yes I have experienced a few occasional crashes to the desktop and glitches but they came much later in the game for some reason.

The more I read the more interested I became. The semi finished product however, was nothing like I was hoping for. I guess I wasn't the only one. Mind numbingly boring. Played the hell out of it when it first came out, made the mistake of finishing crimson fleet and UC. Finished their story lines and NO ONE attacks me. So I have no enemies on the board. I go into cookie cutter buildings without any conflict. I had to add mods to build ships freely, and ended up discarding main companions rather quickly due to them constantly screaming at me for shooting things.

Literal maps of the main settlements in the game were nonexistent. Even now the new ""maps"" they have placed are basically uselessly cluttered with icons with no real understanding of the layout of a city. 

Basically every single selling point of this game, is underwhelming, and was unfinished upon launch.  Less buggy than nearly every other game they have produced however, what does that matter when the gameplay is so mind numbingly boring. Shipbuilding was the only mechanic that felt different or close to what they promised but in the end mechanically they provide almost nothing for your character.

Starfield,1716740,185282831,"I wanted to like this game, I followed its development since it was announced and was super hyped on it. I do think there are caveats with space games that make the genre inherently difficult to get right like the fact that a futuristic-multi-planet civilization is going to have A LOT of people and A LOT of cities that should be ENORMOUS, and how do you balance that feeling with the limitations of modern computer infrastructure? I wouldn't say many games have been wild successes in the genre and a lot have tried.

Farming/medieval towns with a few castles are much more ""believable"" in comparison to a futuristic setting like Starfield.

That said, this game is pretty painful. I hate inventory management, it's annoying and Bethesda thinks immersion has to do with having a million items you can pick up and a text based inventory that you can't sort or manipulate easily. If you're going to give me text based inventory rather than the more obviously popular visual inventories used in nearly every other game then you better let me sort it like an excel spreadsheet on any parameter that I want. Why is my food gumming up my Stim/Med menu? I collect food to cook stuff, but uncooked it's worthless compared to my meds. The UI is atrocious and seems to completely disregard how actual players want to spend their time in the game. Why can't I sort based on weight when you penalize me for picking stuff up in the game.

Some of the faction quests are fun, I enjoyed the Terramorph questline, but so many quests are just ""go here get this, bring it back,"" even the main storyline ends up feeling like this. And then you end up locking a bunch of combat mechanics behind NG+ when I didn't enjoy the game enough to finish it in the first place and you want me to play through the whole thing over and over to unlock everything?

I haven't even bothered to try to figure out what's going on with the marketplace stuff and I pre-ordered the fancy edition so they gave me credits to get the DLC and some other stuff, but it just feels ridiculous to be paying for these other things or trying to find mods to fix the base game if the base game feels so far from what I'd expect from a AAA title.

If I'm going to sit down and devote what little free time I have to a game I want devs to be considerate of my time, I don't want to spend a bunch of extra time trying to fix everything they were too lazy to do themselves. If your game has great story and fun mechanics and epic battles then give me an interface that lets me experience those things easily rather than me editing everything to make UI and superfluous cutscenes take up all my time.

Starfield,1716740,185274208,"If you're a fan of Bethesda games, there's little doubt you'll enjoy Starfield. The game offers improvements compared to earlier titles like Fallout 4 and Skyrim, particularly in performance, character interactions, and the leveling system. However, it falls short in ambition, leaving the experience somewhat lackluster.

Players expecting a grand sci-fi adventure akin to Mass Effect, with diverse alien races and thrilling exploration, may be disappointed. Instead, the game presents a universe populated by humans with a light sprinkling of sci-fi elements.

While Starfield includes several engaging storylines, not all of them land successfully. The addition of base-building is an interesting idea, but it feels undermined by the mechanics of New Game Plus and the talent system. For instance, some talents feel disconnected from the gameplay, such as needing a specific talent just to use the backpack boost effectively.

One of the standout features is spaceship building, which can be quite enjoyable. Constructing your own spaceship is rewarding and gives you a meaningful use for credits, though more customization options would have been appreciated.

Except space is vast. It's empty. And so for exploring a game that calls itself ""NASA-punk"" despite not understanding punk at all, it needs to do more than be an interesting tech demo.

""what starfield needs to do,"" ""what might be in the new update?,"" ""will the DLC tell us everything we want to know about the Va'ruun?""  So many of those articles are just speculation and wish lists. And when Bethesda releases something without the wishlist features that they never promised, people get bent. It's just so weird to me. 

In any case, if you want something chill, to run at your own pace, and have so much to explore and learn and do, this is it right here. This is the decaf to those manic FPS games. So pull up a seat at the Viewport, and see what the Settled Systems have for you. Good luck.",True,69,273775
Starfield,1716740,185142747,"I feel like in a lot of ways, Starfield is some antiplatonic ideal of ""Skyrim with guns"" that you can slap a ""in space"" to the end of. There's a load of generated planets with a steady loop of maybe like ten or so routinely generated interiors that spawn on certain planets with loot and hostile NPCs similarly generated. You go to the place and kill the guy and take his stuff and gain experience points and level up in the piecemeal way that both Skyrim and Fallout 4 manage level-ups as so they feel almost like they've crammed the experience of a gacha game into a AAA open world adventure RPG in how much they're blueballing you but it's fine in Skyrim because the vistas are nice and it's fine in Fallout 4 because the gunplay is smooth.

Starfield tries to blend both into the context of a vast-space exploration game and it's insanely weird in ways I cannot describe with words. It feels like a game cooked up in a lab to be stereotypically Bethesda-ey with some considerations of contemporary roleplaying titles' directions, with the most interesting being the sliding-scale difficulty modifiers wherein players can shift their yield of experience points by making certain elements of the game harder or easier by select categories. Additionally, aspects of its story later delve into metatextual conceptualizations of certain themes of videogames as a medium themselves.

The issue with Starfield is that a lot of the time it feels more like a time sink than a compelling title. Like previous Bethesda titles, its primary form of interaction is ultimately combat, which in the setting of a shooter is expected, but naturally means its ultimate impact on play, and especially grinding, shifts into the realm of mindlessness as you fly to different planets, kill all the pirates at procedurally generated facilities take their stuff and sell it etcetera until you get enough money for the ship or home whatever expensive thing you want. The game's strategies are about as limited as Skyrim's insofar as doing a sneak archer build is good at killing people but this time with a bolt-action and this is a game where a majority of general interactions are between you and random goons you can't negotiate with, and the consequence is that, unlike its contemporaries such as Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring, where strategy is more than picking up a big gun and killing the guy, the gameplay is held to the unfortunate limitations that come with shooter-RPGs, such as Cyberpunk 2077. But where 2077 more than makes up for the rudimentary nature of the genre by inviting players into a fleshed out world with compelling characters and striking intimate narrative beats in its story - alongside a wider-array generally of its combat mechanics - Starfield is often left in the unfortunate position of tracing in the footsteps of Bethesda titles' complicated relationship to open world games. Fallout 3 and 4 are fun romps, but that they begin the exact same way in Vaults 101 and 111 is a trait shared by Starfield. Fresh new games always begin with you being a lowly miner despite all of the genuinely well-developed character backstory traits that can color your experience - and they genuinely do, especially the trait that gives you parents - means that there's an unfortunate hold on this tradition, even as new game plus runs give variety to this. The consequence is that the game is structured by certain limitations of the player's origins in a way that unfortunately bleed into the rest of the title. The game nominally can be played with the player becoming Doctor Murderhobo and Murderhobo-ing their way across the Settled Systems, but you'll eventually run into some guy you can't kill who will take a knee because he's too important to die in the game keeping true to an unfortunate Bethesda tradition in their brand of storytelling. I don't particularly mind this; ultimately, Bethesda titles are highly structured and in many ways assume players won't be put in positions where they'll be upset about the guy you can't kill because he takes a knee because you respect the social contract of the game's flow and narrative pacing and won't randomly decide to break a guy's legs because why not this isn't real life, but, as a safeguard, they make sure certain characters are essential until they aren't in service of preserving their narratives. This structuring isn't inherently bad in stories - most players, after all, don't decide to randomly snap and start beating people to death in the middle of an otherwise amicable environment - but Bethesda titles unfortunately often feel small because of this. As consequence, the game's general tone is further numbed into this idea of a grand space adventure where you and your band of nerds who really like space go on adventures and kill more people than any of us will in our lives and take their stuff and then maybe go to a quest in the libertarian society's mini Night City and convince Ancap Board Leader Mr. It's Actually Called Ephebophilia that he should stop being such a bastard.

Starfield's characterization of its companions often feels genuinely nice, a better trait it inherits from previous Bethesda titles. Sarah, Sam, Barrett, and others all bring nice little stories that help illustrate the world, but it's unfortunately often in service of a fiction that's been often underwritten in ways that feel simple. A simple example of this is that the libertarian country that I made a pedophilia joke about earlier caps out their discount Texas Rangers elite deputy organization with twelve members total. A dozen guys for a political bloc that collectively controls three planetary systems and is one of just three governmental organizations in the entire game. Meanwhile, the Colony War, a devastating conflict between two of the factions, is stated to only have taken around thirty-thousand lives of the larger of the two factions. These numbers don't automatically damage the game's backstory; the libertarians might just have set the limit of active Freestar Rangers to 12 to remind everybody what the age of consent is and it's meant to illustrate that they aren't exactly a competently militarized state like the larger United Colonies, but there's more to the game's notes that unfortunately keeps eating away at the title's inner cohesion, namely the fact that earth was destroyed. Which is a lot.

That's pretty big. Earth is gone and it's ambiguous as to what the population of the Settled Systems is in actual terms given the fact that it's pretty hard to rapidly evacuate several billion people from a planet rapidly experiencing that sort of collapse. While companions' warm personalities help explore this and flesh out the human element of living in what is essentially a quasi-post apocalyptic society in many unspoken ways, a lot of answers from the story carry flimsy explanations, which unfortunately erodes on much of the game's believability insofar as its story seems ultimately often clinical and restricted in service of creating a title that holds certain norms towards the space exploration group Constellation despite the gutting implications of certain elements of the story's lore that often hand-waves, if not ignores. Broader questions as to the population of the Settled Systems and why the vast populations of criminal enterprises are not a more existential threat to humanity given the seemingly limited numbers of species evacuated from Earth prior to its atmosphere collapsing and killing everybody. This is somewhat microcosmic for my issues with the story, as the game drifts into the territory of feeling textually vapid in key aspects that would otherwise populate the scenario with a greater degree of intrigue. Anyways, the companions are nice even if they'll loudly talk about how good you are at sex after you've romanced them in front of Sam's ten year old kid if you invite them on your ship. This is hilarious and very Bethesda-y and I would not change this but it is very funn",True,2,6580

The reasons are obvious and extensively documented/reported on hundreds of threads, youtube videos, etc. The game is incredibly outdated. It's boring, it's extremely safe and overly PG friendly, a great example of this is the Astral Lounge where even a club in Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines from 2004 had more soul and substance than this crap.

The only reason why I've been playing this game is literally because you can make really cool ships and then role-play as a space-traveler, chilling in your ship, something I always loved in their games which thankfully they didn't ruin this time like the rest. The quest line is really generic, none of the factions interest me at all. The immersion is completely trash because the NPCs AI is absolute trash, you can enter any building basically, go to any room you want and no one will care, they'll even look at you and just smile with the ugly faces they made for these characters.

Mods for Bethesda Games used to be an addon, like a cherry on top of the cake for you to keep coming back to their games years and decades after. But for this game, they are absolutely essential even for a first playthrough. Honestly IF I ever complete this game, I'll probably never revisit it. I thought Bethesda wanted to redeem theirselves after the shitshow Fallout 76 was but clearly I was wrong and thanks to this game I have absolutely no expectations for TES VI.

Just like other major companies we all loved while growing up, these are not the same devs that had any passion making their older game titles, just like the company's goals have completely shifted, the old Bethesda Games Studio is dead and this is a souless husk of its corpse instead. Todd, thanks for everything but please retire.",False,3,2592
Starfield,1716740,185118613,"Despite all of the controversy, I actually mildly enjoyed this game.

For a AAA game, and for $70 (at time of writing, still the original cost as it was at launch) no, I wouldn't recommend this, made even worse for a $30 DLC. It's clear where some places they included some things just to say the game 'had' a feature and then called it a day, or they stopped short of finishing a feature. There were a lot of things that were 'on the cusp of greatness' that just falls short.

Starfield,1716740,185093523,"Starfield is an engaging and entertaining experience, a quintessential Bethesda game, quirks (bugs) and all. There’s an abundance of content to sink your time into, and while it’s not perfect, it’s undeniably enjoyable. That said, I did wish for a more immersive experience in certain areas, like ship piracy, which feels limited when you encounter ships you can’t board, especially bounty hunter vessels. Inventory management is also a mixed bag, creative but tedious, especially when managing resources. An unlimited storage option for outposts, akin to the containers in the Constellation lodge, would have been a welcome addition.

The main storyline and lore offer a decent level of immersion, but the constant chatter from NPCs, particularly on the ship, can be chaotic. While this adds a sense of realism, I’d appreciate the ability to adjust volumes for clarity. Exploration, one of the game’s highlights, felt slightly underwhelming due to the lack of variation among planets. Despite that, wandering through Starfield’s universe still has its charm, offering some breathtaking vistas and day-night cycles that are stunning to behold.

Core gameplay systems like scanning planets, space combat, and ground combat have their strengths. Space combat, especially against capital or multiple ships, is a chaotic delight, requiring thoughtful ship builds. Ground combat showcases decent NPC tactics, depending on your chosen difficulty level. However, resource management can be frustrating, particularly for aspiring space traders, as vendors often lack the funds to buy your wares. Bethesda, we need a Space Supermart!

Visually, Starfield delivers. While flora and fauna could use a touch more realism, the overall design, especially the vistas and planetary skies, is mesmerizing. There’s nothing quite like sitting on a planet and watching the sky as the day passes. It’s moments like these where the game truly shines.

Side content and faction missions are plentiful, perhaps too plentiful, but they do add value. However, more dynamic consequences for faction decisions and a greater variety of ground-based random encounters would enhance immersion. Dialogue choices in encounters, while decent, could be more dynamic and impactful.

Customization is a standout feature, with robust options for character creation, shipbuilding, and gear upgrades. The hard choices about where to invest your skill points add a layer of strategy that I appreciated. Still, a deeper backstory option for your character could elevate the immersion further.

While Starfield does provide a sense of freedom, it often gently nudges you back onto the intended path, likely to prevent unintended consequences from derailing the experience. This balanced approach ensures a positive gameplay experience, though replayability might feel limited due to fixed outcomes.

My favorite aspect of the game is exploration. There’s so much to see and do that it’s easy to get lost in its vastness. On the flip side, the lengthy conversations with NPCs can sometimes drag and pull you out of the action.

Would I recommend Starfield? Absolutely. But as I always say, my experience might not be your experience. Use my thoughts as a guide to make your own informed decision. If you love vast, immersive worlds and enjoy taking in the sights, Starfield is worth a try. It’s not the best game ever, nor the worst, it’s a fun interstellar romp that lets you escape into another universe. A true time sink, it’ll take you away... just like Calgon.

The game would have to be completely remade from the ground up.
First off the engine is still out of date and busted.
Worlds are copy pasted poorly designed messes of mostly empty space. 
The cities are little more than spread out shops.
Inventory space is minuscule requiring you to make frequent trips back to your ship.
You want to build your ship to have more inventory space but if you don't build a fighter style ship you get shot down.
There's no space flight, just an arena next to the planet for getting into fights or do nothing events. 
There is no planet landing or taking off, you teleport to and from space and from planet to planet.
The guns are poorly animated and often don't operate in the way the designers obviously wanted. 
Some of the guns are useless while the others have tiers of power.
The weapon upgades/mods can't be removed and put on another gun. (Attachments are not items so upgrading lower tier items are a waste of resources.)
There is base building that is completely pointless and wastes your time. 
There's challenge based progression in the skill tree. (You must complete a challenge in order to unlock the ability to spend a skill point on a certain skill.)
Some quests break other quests.

Still after a year and patches, i experience a lot of bugs, still your KI Companion is running against walls, still you are glitching trough stairs like it was 2002.
 
About the Gameplay: the whole game feels a bit numb while playing. Part wise it's more like you play a nice made mod right from nexus, than a full price product. Of course, it has its quality, the voice actors are professional, but the dialogs lack a lot of this good old Bethesda sarcasm and humor, you could find in games before like Fallout.

Instead of this feeling a skyrim gave you before when you explore this great wide landscape, you can expect way more restricted areas like caves and space stations, everything else like exploring the planets gets boring pretty fast, you need to see way too much of plain dust and sand landscapes.

Starfield,1716740,185007094,"Starfield Review: A Monumental Journey to the Stars

Starfield, Bethesda’s highly anticipated sci-fi RPG, is a massive leap into the final frontier, offering an expansive universe ripe for exploration. As the studio’s first new IP in over 25 years, it sets its sights on delivering a deep, immersive experience blending Bethesda’s signature RPG elements with the uncharted vastness of space. After hundreds of hours, it’s clear that Starfield largely succeeds in realizing this ambitious vision, although it’s not without some bumps along the way.

Gameplay: Exploration and Freedom
At its core, Starfield offers players a truly open-world experience, but this time, the world is a galaxy. With over 1,000 planets and countless space stations, moons, and star systems, the scale of the game is impressive. Space travel itself is immersive and expansive, letting players fly seamlessly between planets, engage in dogfights with hostile ships, or explore the depths of alien worlds. The flight mechanics and ship customization are deep enough to appeal to fans of space simulators but remain accessible for those who simply want to explore the unknown.

The planets themselves vary widely in their biomes, from lush forests to barren rocks. The most captivating part of exploration is the sheer freedom it offers. You can choose to follow the main story, focus on side missions, or carve your own path through the cosmos. Whether mining resources, upgrading your ship, or stumbling across hidden artifacts, Starfield encourages curiosity at every turn. However, while the number of planets is vast, some lack meaningful content, feeling like empty, procedural landscapes with minimal depth.

Story and Quests: A Mixed Bag
The main storyline of Starfield revolves around the Constellation faction, a group of space explorers seeking answers to the mysteries of the universe. It’s a solid narrative, with intriguing world-building and fascinating lore surrounding the ancient artifacts scattered across the galaxy. However, while the main story has its moments of grandeur, it occasionally feels bogged down by slow pacing and predictable plot beats. It’s a familiar tale of discovery and exploration, but it doesn’t offer the same emotional punch or complexity found in Bethesda’s other iconic games like The Elder Scrolls or Fallout series.

Side quests, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. Some are standout experiences, delving into intriguing character arcs, faction politics, or moral dilemmas. Others feel derivative, recycling similar tasks like scanning plants or gathering materials. Still, the sheer volume of content means there’s something for everyone, and even the more mundane quests can be a good excuse to explore the world further.

Character Progression and Combat
Bethesda’s signature RPG elements, such as character creation, skill progression, and dialogue systems, are present and well-executed. Players can tailor their character to their playstyle, be it as a skilled pilot, an efficient engineer, or a smooth-talking diplomat. The skill trees are robust, and there’s a lot of room for experimentation with different builds. That being said, some aspects of character progression can feel somewhat shallow, particularly when compared to other modern RPGs that offer more complex systems.

Combat in Starfield is another area that shows both promise and frustration. The mix of ranged weapons, power armor, and space ship combat is exciting at first, but it often devolves into standard third-person shooting with less depth than one might hope for in a Bethesda RPG. Melee combat feels lackluster, and while the variety of weapons is impressive, it often feels like there’s no real weight behind them. Space combat, however, is thrilling, particularly when battling in zero-gravity or engaging in tense dogfights with enemies.

Graphics and Performance
Visually, Starfield is a stunning game, with breathtaking vistas of alien planets, dazzling space scenes, and detailed environments. The lighting, especially when transitioning from the depths of space to the surface of a planet, creates a sense of scale that’s difficult to capture in words. However, despite its impressive visuals, the game suffers from occasional technical issues like frame drops, glitches, and texture pop-ins, especially on older hardware. These hiccups can pull you out of the experience, but the game’s sheer scale makes it easy to overlook them in the grand scheme of things.

Final Thoughts: A Cosmic Achievement with Room for Improvement
Starfield is undeniably an ambitious and impressive game, offering a massive universe filled with potential for exploration, discovery, and adventure. The depth of its world-building, combined with its open-ended gameplay, will keep players hooked for hours. Yet, while the game succeeds in creating a compelling space adventure, it struggles in a few key areas—namely, its storytelling, combat systems, and occasional technical performance issues.

Still, Starfield is a game worth experiencing for any fan of open-world RPGs or space exploration. It’s a monumental step forward for Bethesda, even if it doesn’t quite reach the same heights as its other legendary titles. For those willing to overlook some rough edges, it offers an unforgettable journey through the stars.",True,4,3978

Starfield,1716740,184963498,"I played Starfield upon release and recently picked it back up a little over a year later. Starfield just comes across as lazy to me. Just about every aspect of a ""Bethesda game"" is worse in Starfield than it was in Fallout 4. The game has little improvement from release with many of the same issues STILL in the game 1 year later. 

Issues:
1) The perk/skill system is over constrained. Not only does the player have to level up to gain the skill point, but they also have to complete various requirements to be able to advance in that skill. Have a skill point available? Want to level up ballistics from 1 to 2? Did you kill 10 guys? No, too bad. In addition to this, the skill system is also very bloated with combat, social, crafting and ship combat all competing for the same skill points. I think you need to reach level 350+ to get all the skills, but only need to get to level 60-70 to complete the game with a reasonable amount of time spent on side quests. Due to all these issues, the player either has to give up on aspects of the game because they are locked out due to the skill system OR the player grinds in some manner to skill up (I am 2 hours of story into this play through, but have spent 20+ hours grinding so I can get to level 65 to have most of the ""baseline"" skills I think I need).

2) Creation engine is far past its self life. The game NPCs look fairly poor, there are lots of glitches and it still bugs out occasionally. There are many games the look better and handle the demand better than Starfield.

3) The story is fine, but nothing to write home about. As with most Bethesda games, the found side content is the best part. 

In summary, Bethesda is milking their audience. I do find this game better than some other games because you can transition quickly between places of interest. The downside is that the game has a ton of loading screens. The combat is fine for the most part. Most of the main issues are with Bethesda's poor support and an outdated engine. If Bethesda wants the community to fix the game, they did a poor job with that because the vast majority of mods disable achievements.

Edit upon playing another 15ish hours after this review. 

I have uninstalled the game and hidden it from my game list. As my game progressed, the load times became longer and longer; with a load after a death taking upwards of 10 minutes on a brand new computer with the latest SSD. I can tolerate  this if I only need to load once per play session and it supposedly resets upon NG+. 

Let's stack on top of this a gear/skill check mission where space combat is required AND no supporting quests in the quest line to build space combat skills. I died twice, taking 10 minutes between 20 second attempts, and finally set all the space combat setting to very easy to get through this mission. Wouldn't you know it, the game bugs out and my space ship is uncontrollable causing me to die for a 3rd time. Instead of waiting another 10 minutes to try a poorly implemented mission due to a save issue the community has diagnosed months ago, I decided I would uninstall and play something else.

Don't trust reviews, make your own opinions, I like this game.

For a breakdown of my own opinions, consider the following Pros/Cons section. These are my own opinions so you can decide for yourself which are Pros and which are Cons for YOU.

[h2] Pros [/h2]

- Effectively endless exploration and dungeons
- The best character creation in a Bethesda game (imo)
- Spend 50 hours just in the ship builder
- Huge variety of companions with useful skills for your ship & outposts
- Romance is much more natural & interesting than previous Bethesda games
- Slow-burn main story with a surprisingly great mystery and multiple good twists
- Less load screens than Oblivion
- Planets are re-generated on every new playthrough.
- Spend another 50 hours decorating the interior of your ship.
- Shutting off your brain and surveying planets while listening to music or a podcast is surprisingly relaxing
- Game is very pretty (except for the barren planets that are just alot of brown)
- So many novelty coffee mugs to collect, I'm still finding new ones
- World-building on par with any other Bethesda game (or maybe better)
- Tons of books and terminals to read for additional world building
- Space politics?!
- Phil Hill

[h2] Cons [/h2]

- Planets are procedurally generated so exploration feels less like Fallout and more like No Man's Sky (subjective, I don't consider this a con but you might)
- Fewer romance options than previous Bethesda games (But romance is deeper)
- Repetitive dungeons (but less so than Oblivion or Skyrim imo)
- Game is too big to possibly explore everything in one human lifetime
- Outpost building is much more limited than settlements in Fallout 4
- Opening hours of the main story are very slow, but the twists it takes are crazier than any other Bethesda game so I encourage you to be patient with it. The buildup is well worth it.
- Spend 50 hours just in the ship builder
- Phil Hill won't marry me.",True,1,16929

You like Skyrim and Fallout? You'll likely very much like Starfield. There's a few features from games like No Man's Sky that would have been nice to have.

Starfield,1716740,184767694,"5/10 - TLDR: A game that promises so much but continually half-delivers. Starfield's narrative says nothing which makes it toothless and boring. Same goes for the characters and underfed environments. Outpost stuff is fun and some of the spacecraft flight can be enjoyable. 

I put about 70 hours into this game. I wanted to give it an earnest play-through before I collected my thoughts about the elements that do and don't work. Hopefully, others will find this review useful. 

Starfield kicks off with potential. The space-rock miner bit is fun and hints at a gameplay mechanic which you, the player, continue to wield for the entirety of the experience. Soon after, you receive your first ship, one of the most exciting prospects of gameplay that attracted so many, including myself, to this title. Most of us arrived to this Steam page with the hope that Starfield would fulfil our fantasy of captaining a spacecraft across a vast galaxy, exploring the cities and towns across planets, encountering troubling scenarios to solve, meeting and leaving lovers, battling other spacefaring captains, and building space outposts to secure your place across the galaxy. 

Starfield only delivers on one of those fantasies. 

THE GOOD: 
The developers did well in the creation of the outposts and their customization. It's probably one of my favourite parts of the game. There are plenty of custom elements and it's fun hunting down planets with the resources you need. Creating your little compound and outfitting it is something that this game does well. 

THE BAD: 
There is a lot. I'll start with the narrative. Starfield's core plot has no bite. Its characters are blank slates. The side-missions available on a staggering amount of planets grow stale quickly as they repeat in structure and look. I can't imagine how difficult it is to ensure your narrative is cohesive and entertaining with recognizable themes for such a massive title. But it's not impossible, because CD Projekt Red has done it time and time again. If you want an immense open-world experience with carefully crafted stories, a narrative responsive to your choices, atmospheres and places that feel real, characters that have a voice, and a plot that has decided to actually say something, don't play Starfield. Try Cyberpunk 2077. Btw the only enjoyable character is Barrett. Shoutout that guy and his voice actor. Well done.

Beyond the narrative, which is truly a let-down, the next worst element is ship flight and crafting. I'll say it: they should have let you fly onto the planet, or at least had some gameplay sequence where you get to land... if you want to. It would just tie the whole piece together. The flight in space isn't bad and there is some essence of depth to it but why are the crew not a part of the fun? What is the point of hiring or collecting a crew if they only add numerical augmentation to the flight? The crew should be active participants in the flight gameplay - responsive to where you fly, how you fly, what you shoot, where you land. The other disappointing bit of the spacecraft gameplay is the customization. While it's awesome to customize the outer pieces of your craft at spaceports, why can we not preview them after confirming a selection... before purchase. Secondly, the customization on the craft is abysmal. We should be able to move around internal elements like lockers and beds and sinks and stuff. 

I'm going to wrap the review up on romance because this is a lot of writing but I promise there is a lot wrong. The romancing sucks in Starfield. It's dry and feels so... unromantic. And yeah, there should be some physical response to good/bad romancing via animation or cutscenes or something. You can really tell that the amount of planning that went into inter-character relationships is poor. There was seemingly no investment in the characters and their relationships and it showed. 

Last thing. I promise. The design and/or look of each city looked like a poor mix of retro-futurism and utopic-futurism. Even if it was purposeful, each of the cities feels strangely cloroxed. See Cyberpunk 2077 for an example of a city and districts that felt alive.",False,3,4144

Starfield,1716740,184759000,"260+ hours, longtime Bethesda fan.

What I loved: The interior design elements aka NASA-punk theme. Combat. Photo mode.

What I liked: Spaceflight mechanics/combat, NewGame+/Starborn concept, the main story/theme, the side missions.

What I disliked: the Starborn power mini games (what kind of crack are y'all smoking at Bethesda that makes these fun?), the Ship Design perk that allows improved ship building is fundamentally broken as the player has to sink hours upon hours of gameplay to make enough credits to afford the whopping FIFTY UNIQUE modules needed to max out the perk.

What I hated: the dialogue is atrocious, when people call the Crimson Fleet ""the Disney Pirates"" it's not an exaggeration - the fact that the player never gets a choice to overthrow All Bark No Bite Delgado and become the pirate king is a maddeningly lost opportunity. On that note, you can't become the leader of ANY faction in this game. Not one. What does Bethesda have against the player holding positions of power? This entire game feels like a missed opportunity because while it does have elements to love and enjoy, unfortunately the bad outweighs the good.

This game clearly has love and soul poured into it as I see where the care and attention lies. Unfortunately it's in all the wrong places. It feels half-loved. Like half of the development team loves their jobs and other half is comprised of slave labor.",False,1,16961

Starfield,1716740,184691396,"the ship building component is beyond broken as F***... the largest components of the game are just broken, and possibly beyond fixing... 

Ship Building: more than half the time the habs dont connect correctly, missing doors... it tells you modules aren't connected but dont show where or what module... 

Questing: missions are broken with no way to progress because NPC's have to move to various locations to trigger the mission to continue, but the NPC's are bugged out and either stuck in place with no way to push into action, or hit an ""invisible wall"" that you need to push them past... 

Companions: they are beyond garbage... often getting bugged out and creating a wall you can't move past... they get angry if they see you do something bad... telling them to wait across time makes no difference apparently they can see you from over 200 kilometers away through many many buildings... they stop moving... you can't talk to them... they become barriers that keep you from moving... they get angry regardless if you shot someone or the air...
