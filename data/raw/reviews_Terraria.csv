Sayangnya Terraria bukan game yang sempurna karena ada beberapa hal yang menyebalkan seperti para pemain kebanyakan menggunakan wikipedia atau semacamnya daripada bertanya ke Si Pemandu / The guide. Masalahnya si Pemandu hanya menjelaskan bagian luar dari Terraria, sementara bagian dalamnya seperti NPC menjual barang aneh ketika berada di kondisi tertentu.

Ini juga berlaku ke si Traveling Merchant dimana dia selalu menjual barang yang tidak diinginkan, aku harap kita bisa memesan barangnya dengan biaya ekstra daripada nunggu dia dengan dagangan yang tidak diinginkan

Lalu sistem persentase mendapatkan item juga menyebalkan karena aku menghabiskan 3 jam untuk mendapatkan UZI dan senjatanya ngak sepadan.

Terraria is a 2D sandbox and open world survival game made and published by Re-Logic. Pointed out as the 2D Minecraft, it lets you do almost what you could imagine: build the whole map, fight tons of bosses, make farms, play co-op on a server with friends, play minigames, and let your creativity runs freely. It has a supported tModloader launcher with tons of mods made by the community. Is it something you can't truly do?

[hr][/hr]
The first time I played it, I got heavily surprised, and that cames because I was a Minecraft fan since early version, when I was an early teenager. I didn't play Terraria after longer and everyone since then threw to my mind it was a Minecraft, but in 2D. I was sceptic, and even if the game surprised me it wasn't a Minecraft, but I wasn't expecting to see some similarities with it in the sanbox terms. Althought this game it's other thing, the resemblances are there, but it has other focus in his core, and the amount of stuff you can do is limited due to being in 2D, but still let you a wide variety of options in the creative aspects. 


➢ [i]Decent 2D pixelart.[/i] Not amazing, I saw way better and more detailed ones, so try to put this on a higher tier wouldn't be fair. Isn't bad either, just a middle term with some cool sprites and animations. Some mods enhance the art and make it look better, but I think the game would look weird with an over complex and detailed pixelart, so I think it was a right choice with the balance between simplicity and details.


➢ [i]Iconic soundtrack[/i]. A variety of songs and melodies that will make you recognize the game whenever you hear it, from cachy rhythms to more frenetic songs during the bossfights.


➢ [i]Huge amount of content[/i]. Between the vanilla including the mods provided by tModloader, it's a game to easily dig thousand of hours, specially with friends, and that will bring you joy over the years with his replayability. 


➢ [i]Great bossfight designs[/i]. Good variety of bosses, events and equipment, and with the options to modify the terrain the strategies to defeat them become enormous. 


➢ [i]Creativity freedom[/i]. To turn your whole world into whole ship, make a castle, turn everything into water or just tun the map into a void, the options are almost endless, without counting the modding. Perfect to let your creativity be free.

[hr][/hr]
Even if I consider this game one of the greatest in the indie marketplace, whatever if it clicks with you or not, it has some stuff I don't like as much, or I think it would be better oriented or they should change. It's not that much, but perfection doesn't exist and you can always strive for something better, right?


➢ [i]Not clear learning curvarture[/i]. I think anyone who play this game blindly, will get confused in what to do or where to go, even if you only have two directions in the beginning, but even when you start learning how, the jump between some bosses becomes harder than you could think, because it has some layers of knowledge you need to learn in order to face the bosses correctly, and it's something that might confuse a lot of beginners.


➢ [i]Wiki-dependency[/i]. I'm not a fan when a game doesn't give you enough resources to know what to do, not hints, not anything, you need to discover everything by yourself so you ended up checking the Wiki because waste hours to find what you need to do, it's not fun at all. It should have a proper in-game wiki.

Tedious and messy. Most of them are not hard at all, and there just a few quite challenging, but it's just a game that you will play hundred of hours in order to complete it, even going in the fast route will take you time, so be patience, check a guide and enjoy the game!

As one of my favorite games I understand why it won't be a game for everyone. It's rough, confusing, the 2D view can be uncomfortable if you are not used to it, or it's just might not be the type of game of your liking, for me at least was a fresh and unique concept, even if it was just copying some core aspects from Minecraft, but doing their own recipe with it with an original touch. I spent hundred of hours on it, most of them out of Steam, whatever it was alone, with friends, with mods. I love almost every aspect of it, and I think it's a rounded game that people of a wide range of ages would love.


It's a game for sandbox lovers, people who love boss fighting, survival or a game with a potential building options to decorate your stuff, since it has a creative mode to spend alone countless of hours there building stuff. Do I recommend it? Hell yes, and it's cheap af, what it brings for what it cost it's just too good.

Terraria,105600,209988080,"If Terraria were a breakfast cereal, it would be pure crystallized lightning flakes, served in a bowl forged from meteorite ore and filled with milk extracted from a celestial starbeast. This game didn’t just entertain me—it abducted me, strapped me to the hype engine, and launched me directly into a dimension where pixel art becomes religion and boss battles become rituals of cosmic dominance.

I came in thinking, “Yeah, cute little sandbox game.”
50 hours later: I’m standing atop my player-built obsidian fortress, wearing armor that would make a demigod weep, screaming at the Moon Lord like I’m headlining a metal concert.

I have 112 out of 115 achievements, which means I’m basically a certified Terraria warlord, a pixelated prophet, a sandbox savant. Each achievement felt like injecting pure dopamine straight into my gaming soul. Farming rare drops? Adrenaline. Defeating bosses? Ecstasy. Accidentally blowing half my house up with dynamite? Peak entertainment.

The moment the soundtrack kicked in for the first boss, I swear something ancient awakened inside me. Every track in this game goes unnecessarily hard—like ""why is this 2D block game suddenly scoring my heroic life montage?""
Every biome? A vibe. Every enemy? A personal vendetta.
Every NPC? A roommate with incredibly questionable life choices.

Building?
Oh. My. God. BUILDING.
I set out to make a simple house. I ended up with an architectural abomination so glorious that Frank Lloyd Wright would rise from the grave just to high-five me.

Terraria is not just a game—
It’s a lifestyle,
a rite of passage,
a multiverse-sized adrenaline factory disguised as a cozy indie adventure.

And the best part?
I’ve still got 3 achievements left.
Three tiny little boxes standing between me and TOTAL TERRARIA ASCENSION.
Once I complete them, I will become one with the Guide. I will speak in crafting recipes. My dreams will be structured in layers of dirt, stone, granite, and marble. I will transcend.

If you have even a single adventurous molecule in your body, get this game.
Board the hype train.
No—board the HYPE STARSHIP, because Terraria isn’t taking you on a journey.

It’s taking you on an odyssey.
A screaming, glorious, boss-slaying, treasure-hoarding odyssey.

Terraria,105600,209911346,"2D Minecraft if Minecraft Wanted You Dead

Terraria is the perfect game for people who think, “What if exploring a cute pixel world meant being violently bullied by literally everything?” Slimes? Violent. Rabbits? Suspicious. The moon? Actively plotting your destruction.

You start with a copper sword that feels like hitting enemies with a wet noodle, and before you know it you’re dual-wielding magical laser weapons while riding a flying pig. Progression is weird, but in a good way.

Bosses? Oh, just casual eldritch horrors summoned by using items that definitely should not be used.
“Oh cool, a voodoo doll!” — Entire world explodes.
“Oh look, a bee hive!” — Regret.
“Oh hey, the Guide died!” — That’s normal, don’t worry about it.

Building is relaxing until a Blood Moon hits and suddenly your cozy cottage becomes the Alamo. NPCs move in, complain, take your money, and get eaten by zombies the moment you’re not looking.

In summary:
Terraria is a cheerful, colorful stress test for your sanity.

Terraria,105600,209891771,"Terraria A Pixelated Rabbit Hole of Pure Fun!

Terraria is one of those games you sit down to try “just for a few minutes,” and suddenly you realize it’s 3 AM and you’re googling how to beat a floating eyeball the size of a minivan. This game is dangerously addictive in the best possible way.

From the moment you chop your first tree, you’re swept into a world bursting with creativity, danger, and endless possibilities. Explore sprawling caverns, build absurdly elaborate bases, battle bizarre bosses, or accidentally release a corruption biome that slowly consumes everything you love. It’s all part of the charm.

What really hooks you is how every little discovery snowballs into something bigger—a new weapon, a deeper cave, a tougher boss, or some weird crafting ingredient you absolutely must understand. And just when you think you’ve seen everything, the game drops another surprise on you.

Terraria is fun, frantic, and fantastically replayable. Whether you love building, exploring, fighting, or just messing around with friends, it’s a game that keeps pulling you back in for “one more adventure”… which we all know is code for several hours.

In short: Terraria is a pixel paradise that’ll steal your time and you won’t mind one bit.

Terraria,105600,209872458,"Genuinely an incredible game. Nothing more to be said.

Satisfying boss fights, though a little easy at points. 

Endless replayability, even more so with mods.

Usually seamless multiplayer, and said multiplayer still doesn't always make bosses a cakewalk unlike other games.

HUGE building capabilities.

Great price for what you're getting.

Difficulty scales have a genuine noticeable difference, and secret seeds just add to that. Doesn't have the same hopeless pits of not being able to beat bosses unlike other games.

Not very much grinding, unless you insist on using some items as crutches like the Rod of Discord. Except for the Uzi. The Uzi sucks to get.

Stuffed to the brim with neat mechanics for you to find, and things to reward those who pay attention.

Has things to appeal to all types of players, like fishing, golfing, PVP (that one is a little meh), Mining, enjoyable bossfights, farming, building, hoarding, achievement hunting, drones, etc.

MODS! Mods add practically a whole second game, adding anything from major content, to making rain prettier, to.... cheese...?

Despite this, you would still need a Wiki to properly experience the game; some things are not spelled out for you, but discovering them on your own would always make you feel successful.  The weaponry are enjoyable, and having four classes to pick from allows players to experiment with a variety of weapons.  The artwork, while simple, are attractive and delightful.

Terraria,105600,209759789,"Terraria was a game I deeply loved, especially for the incredible amount of content it offers: items, outfits, weapons, materials, and much more — all elements that accompany the player on a constant journey of empowerment through the various stages of the adventure. I also greatly appreciated the variety of creatures present: from NPCs with the most disparate personalities, to the annoying enemies that populate every biome, from the cute little animals to the most abominable bosses, true cataclysms ready to crash down on the player. I was also fascinated by the mechanics of the four classes. At first, I didn’t fully understand them, but over time I learned to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of each one, and I found them all well-defined. Nevertheless, I was disappointed that the game’s lore was somewhat pushed into the background: a few lines from NPCs, some superficial entries in the bestiary, and a handful of clues scattered among the items. I would have liked a more developed narrative. I also found it a bit complicated to manage time during gameplay, because the game requires many hours to avoid losing equipment, tools, and other useful resources. Finally, I’d like to briefly mention the game interfaces, which feel a bit outdated (especially the crafting interface and the NPC menus) and could be reworked with an eye toward optimization.",True,0,12295

Terraria,105600,209648253,"one of the greatest games ever, it was in my childhood, allowed me to just sink into this world, forgetting all negative emotions.

Many people still compare it to minecraft, which is understandable to a point.

However this game is more focused on progression, rather than building, and even then you can still build pretty stuff (specially pixel art to later look it up in the map) 

The main problem is that it's tough to start, the game feels like it barely guides you, which can be frustrating, and yes, your emotions are also valid.

But once you understand how to progress, you will understand why this game is really great and why is beloved by many for pretty much 14 years at this point.

If you don't feel like looking up for guides since you feel it sours your experience.. then it's valid! this game really requires outside research to know what to do, which i feel like it could've been better but.. even then i still love it as it is. 

It's funny that.. so many people (including me) first pirated this game, only to realise this was a gem, feel bad for it then buy it legit, sinking hours upon hours of just doing whatever your heart desired, you want to beat the game only with short swords? you can do it, it's gonna be a nightmare? yes, but.. that's the whole point, beat the world the way you want, shape it to your will, then look back at it and realise you've came far.",True,0,19844

Terraria,105600,209589461,"It's not horrible, but I mostly don't like it.
The problem for me is that there is nothing to do. You kinda expect that in a sandbox game, but here it feels more in the foreground. You get almost no progression from exploration. You can dig down for a really long time and find demonite ore. Which is super rare early game. But you can not even do much with it until you defeat the boss that also drops demonite. So why even explore?

And that's the game loop. All progress is tied to a line of bosses. And you don't naturally find/encounter those bosses (with a few exceptions). You look it up in the internet how to unlock them. And that kinda kills exploration. Just exploring doesn't give you anything and when you look up the boss it tells you where to go (there is a little exploration, but it is either go left/right until you encounter the biome x or dig down until depth x).

Same with crafting. It tells you what you can craft with the stuff you currently carry (and you can open one chest and then that counts too). You can not see what you could be crafting that you just lack the resources for. It does not tell you what you could already craft with the stuff you have in several chests. 
Again I do not find out what I can do in game. I look it up in a wiki and then collect the components from my many chests of stuff.

The way I play the game is build and gather resources and when I inevitably get too bored by nothing happening I look up how to get to the next boss. And then do that and the resulting building/crafting. Until I get too bored again.
I guess the ""right"" way to play the game would be to go straight for the boss train. But that would be an even worse game for me.
It just doesn't click for me.",False,8,12703

The game has a ton of gameplay and you're going to rack up a lot of hours just trying to beat the game the first time, But modded Terraria is where this game shines. Downloading and playing the Calamity mod for Terraria completely changes the entire game. This single Mod alone adds over 100 hours of gameplay.

I feel that it is a crime that this game gets compared to Minecraft when virtually the only thing they share is being procedurally generated, fighting skeletons, slimes, and zombies, and needing to mine for ore. Beyond that, the two games are completely different beasts. Despite having 400 hours of play-time, I feel that I have done only one-one hundredth of all I wish to do in this game. Every world I make I find something new, and every build I make feels greater than the last. Beating bosses still isn't easy on Master mode, and often I will challenge myself to find more funny or efficient ways to beat the ones that are easier. All the weapons are fun to play around with (minus the three that aren't), fishing is honestly kinda relaxing (unless ur on the sky-islands), and the balancing from early-late game - while difficult af at early hardmode on master mode - feels really fun and enhances progression.

Some of my fondest memories are of me playing with my brother, running around our base with my heavy lead broadsword, and being too scared to venture into the corruption. After about 4 years of playing on our first world (the entirety of my first playthrough, up to Ocram and Golem), I was looking on the wiki, and noticed howmuch more content was available on newer gen consoles, so I saved up, and eventually got a PS4, and Terraria was the first game I got on it.

I have now played upwards of 5000 hours across PS3, PS4, PS5, PS vita and mobile, and have actually got a PC now, and hope to enjoy many more hours of this phenomenal game. I am also excited to try out mods, as I've heard the modding community is great.

Terraria,105600,209223900,"This looks like a fun game, but there are some things I absolutely HATE and won't play the game because of it.

1. Everything is too small. I used the + icon to zoom in as much as possible but it's still too small. This is not a vision issue, I don't need glasses and see perfectly. It's just I like to play while sitting comfortably at a distance from my monitor. So even zoomed in I would have to squint to play the game. This is even more annoying for the inventory icons because the zoom is not applied to those icons. So I can't tell at all what the icons are and what I can build.

2. The night is too dark. This is also something I absolutely hate in games. I play during the day, with curtains open and lots of sunlight in the room. This makes it difficult to see what's happening on the screen if it's too dark. Even when playing in a dark room at night, it's still too dark. This game turns night into a game mechanic where you need torches to see anything. I hate when games do this. I want to play a game, not squint my eyes to see in the dark. 

I don't care how good the rest of the game is. These core issues make the game unplayable for me.",False,1,30

It’s a 2D sandbox game that perfectly blends building, combat, and discovery. You can dig deep underground for rare treasures, craft powerful gear, and take on epic boss battles — all while shaping the world however you want.

What makes Terraria stand out is the freedom it gives players: there’s no set path, just your imagination and curiosity. Whether you enjoy designing towns, fighting monsters, or exploring mysterious biomes with friends, there’s always something new to uncover. It’s one of those games that feels fresh every time you play.

In short, Terraria is the perfect game for players who love creativity, challenge, and adventure — a must-try classic that never gets old.

Terraria,105600,208986092,"Terraria is one of the best games I’ve ever played. When I first started, I thought it was just a cheap Minecraft rip-off. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Before long, I found myself spending hours reading the wiki, watching videos, and learning every detail about the game. I’ve invested countless hours into Terraria—probably less than some players, but still a lot for me.I first finished it on Xbox, then on mobile, and now I’m completing it again on Steam. Every average update feels like a massive DLC packed with new content. Take your time, Redigit—don’t rush anything. You have the potential to make this the best sandbox game on Steam.
That said, there are still a few things I’d like to point out—some that affect gameplay and others that don’t as much. One example is what I call “the V of Evil.” In Hardmode, things change drastically. Before Hardmode, you can defend against and even remove evil biomes, but after entering it, the game suddenly fills you with dread—as if a cancer is constantly spreading and impossible to stop. You’re barely strong enough to defeat a single mechanical boss, yet the world around you keeps getting consumed. Even if you manage to contain it, it feels overwhelming, and if you don’t, your world becomes nearly unplayable—NPCs move out, and biomes feel lifeless. This part of the game could definitely use some improvement.
Another issue is fishing. It feels tedious and boring, especially with the Angler’s daily quests. Why can’t we have multiple missions per day? Fishing could be made more engaging with a small minigame—perhaps if you fail, your line breaks and you lose the catch.
Finally, the game isn’t very beginner-friendly. When I first played, I was lucky to have friends who helped me understand the massive amount of content without rushing ahead. Later, when I tried playing solo, I had to rely heavily on the wiki, because the in-game Guide and tutorial only cover the basics. Maybe the developers could improve this by expanding the Guide’s advice or enhancing the Bestiary to include details about biomes, ores, and more advanced tips",True,0,6201

Search up the next boss because the game doesn't tell you.

Grind for the new armor and weapon with slightly better stats. <- this is the longest step

Get 2 gold 1 stick, gold sword.
Get 2 diamonds 1 stick, diamond sword.
Get 1 netherite ingot and an upgrade, Netherite sword. That's the best it gets. 
You can add enchantments to these items to make them better with books.

Terraria progression:
First, go to the NPC bingoth nigglestein, the poop salesman and get 200 lumps of rat feces. Then, go to the ocean, kill a whale to get it's penis. Then grind 20000 hours in caves to mine 20 emeralds and get to hell. Once in hell, you want to kill as many imps as you can with a wooden sword until one drops an imp-doo claw. Then, go to the banker NPC on Hanukkah, and if he is in a good mood, you can buy back your foreskin for 10,000 gold. Finally, go to the anvil and you will be able to craft the Rat shit sword (this is an early-game item and does 2 dps)

Idk, maybe it can be better with modding, but if you have to resort to modding a game to make it tolerable/fun to play, then you're kinda just cheating. Now give me my jester reward and leave me alone. I'm gonna go play a block-building game that's actually fun.",False,0,9239

Every boss fight forces you to think differently, every upgrade actually feels earned.

What makes it great is the freedom: you can build, explore, fight, farm, or just chill and decorate. It’s not about rushing to the end — it’s about making your own world feel alive.

Terraria,105600,208569982,"I've been grinding Terraria for the past days, weeks even.
I've watched a ton of Terraria content before getting the game.

Terraria as a game might seem easy and simple, and while it is, it does take a bit of learning from your mistakes/skill.

From my experience, the progression is kinda unclear, I had to use a Wiki to know how to progress. Like, how is a new player supposed to know that in order to summon a boss, he needs for example 6 lenses and craft at an altar. 

I am sorry if it is mentioned somewhere and I simply have no idea. As I said, from my experience.

The gameplay though, it's enjoyable. While I myself wouldn't say it is something   extraordinary, it is definitely a new experience compared to anything I have played before.
Multiple ways to play, classes; easy to play with friends, quick multiplayer setup; balanced equipment and bosses, though the mechanical bosses HP jump might feel a bit overwhelming if undergeared (ex. Still using the breaker blade).

For when the game was released, in my eyes it still meets modern standards for a great game. The sprites, updated 3 years ago (as of writing this), look great and fit the game perfectly.

The mod support (tModLoader) is significantly better than any other I have encountered earlier. The modding community is definitely something else as well; take Calamity for example.


Overall, a 9/10 game for me.
I would recommend it to anyone that likes a bit of adventure mixed with farming and a different side of combat.
The reason it's not getting a 10 is pretty simple; after beating the Moonlord there isn't much left to do, as at that point you've most likely explored most of the world, killed every boss, and have endgame gear.",True,0,3589

- If you like exploration and adventure, buy it! The procedurally generated world offers new traps, landscapes, temples and dungeons each time you start a new game.

- If you like progression and boss fights, buy it! A lot of the huge leaps in progression are tied to boss fights and their are plenty of bosses and events to keep you entertained.

- If you like a challenge, buy it! There are plenty of game modes and difficulties to keep you on your toes, along with 'drunk seeds' that'll really shake your experience up.

Terraria,105600,208469342,"Okay, let's cut to the chase. You've probably seen this game described as ""2D Minecraft."" Let me stop you right there. That's like calling a dragon a ""flying lizard."" It's technically true but misses the entire point and the sheer, unadulterated AWESOMENESS.

Terraria isn't just a game; it's a digital black hole for your free time, and you'll be thanking it for every single lost hour.

The hook: ""Just one more chest...""

The loop is simple, addictive, and brutally effective. You start with a copper shortsword that can barely defeat a slime, and before you know it, you're summoning cosmic horrors from another dimension and building a railway to Hell to fight a giant wall of flesh. The progression is chef's kiss.

The crafting tree is absolutely massive. You're not just making a better pickaxe; you're building arenas with heart statues, wiring up teleporters, and crafting wings so you can literally fly. The sense of ""I am a god"" power creep is real, and it feels fantastic.

The content-pocalypse

The amount of content in this game for its price is straight-up illegal. We're talking dozens of bosses, each more insane than the last, hundreds of enemies, thousands of items, and biomes that will make your jaw drop (and then try to kill you). The Jungle wants to poison you, the Dungeon is filled with spooky skeletons, and the Corruption/Crimson is just a vibe... a nasty, flesh-eating vibe.

This game doesn't just have an endgame; it has multiple ""Wait, THAT was just the tutorial?!"" moments. You'll think you've beaten the game, and then a cult shows up and you have to fight a literal lovecraftian moon. I'm not kidding.

Building your dream pad (or a deathtrap Box)

The building is so much fun. You can create a cozy hobbit hole, a majestic castle in the sky, or, let's be real, a series of ugly wooden boxes for your NPCs. They deserve it for their sassy comments. The creative freedom is insane, and half the fun is engineering your base to be impenetrable to the next ""Blood Moon"" event when the zombies decide they know how to open doors.

Verdict: 10/10, No Notes

Terraria is the GOAT of sandbox games. It's a perfect blend of exploration, combat, crafting, and building, all wrapped up in a charming, pixel-art package. The devs have supported this thing for over a decade with massive, free updates. They are absolute legends.

TL;DR:
If you have a pulse and enjoy having fun,BUY THIS GAME. It's an insane value and one of the best games ever made. Just be warned: you'll start playing, look up at the clock, and realize it's next Tuesday.

[i] Terraria [/i] is a modern classic which speaks to the ability of the indy dev to far exceed the work of AAA devs backed by millions of dollars. The game has replayability that never bores, especially with the amazing tmodloader which brings infinite new content from the community that continues to entertain. [i] Terraria [/i] has been an incredible game and the developers continue to pour love and creativity in to the gamespace (despite the fact that the last update was supposed to be years ago).

[h2] Who's it for? [/h2]
I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games like Minecraft [/i], especially modded [i] Minecraft [/i]. [i] Terraria [/i] is often called ""2d Minecraft"", but [i] Terraria's [/i] spectacular progression system has pushed it leagues above [i] Minecraft [/i] in certain aspects. [i] Terraria [/i] piques the interest of the creative soul as well, including hundreds of different things to build with, with tasteful additions that allow truly wonderful builds despite the ""restriction"" of only two dimensions.

[h2] Community and Modding[/h2]
The spectacular creativity of the [i] Terraria [/i] community is the beating heart of this game, and I would implore anyone who enjoys this game to play through modded versions, like [i] Calamity, Fargo's mod, or Thorium, [/i] which often are so refined that they can double (or greatly expand) the game's content, with incredibly in-depth detail and lore. 

[h2] In conclusion: [/h2]
Overall, [i] Terraria [/i] would be worth purchasing at a price of $80, but is generously offered at $12.99 CAD, and goes on sale occaisonally.

Terraria,105600,208428503,"Terraria is a great game. With over 500 hours played across all devices I have finally decided to write a review.
(SPOILER WARNING skip to the very end for the rating)

Terraria can be split up into two main sections, pre=hardmode and hardmode. Early pre-hardmode can be a bit tedious as you spawn into the world with almost nothing and having to build up your arsenal from scratch. After you kill your first few bosses however, the speed at which you progress speeds up quite a bit, with you knowing a bit more about the game mechanics. The first boss you will (most likely) fight is the Eye of Cthulhu. This boss is a pretty easy win as long as you have some decent gear. In the first phase, he will just float towards you and occasionally spawn in some mini eyes to chase after you. The second phase is where it gets harder as he gains a dash attack, which can be a bit tricky to dodge. The second boss is dependent on your world evil: the crimson or the corruption, with the bosses being the Brain of Cthulhu or the Eater of Worlds respectively. In my opinion, the Eater is the easier of the two just because I dislike the little gremlins the Brain spawns. Both of these are good fights though, each having their own unique mechanics.  The nest boss to fight is Skeletron. This dud must've been drinking his milk as a kid, because he is tough as bones. For the most part he kinda just flys at you but sometimes he does a magic trick and a bunch of heads start coming at you; pause. The final boss of pre-hardmode is the wall of flesh and can be pretty hard for a new player, even in classic mode, but I think this is a good thing. The game makes you learn to improve your character if you want to progress, which will be needed for some of the later fights. You have now entered hardmode. After killing the WOF, you will YET AGAIN be thrown into a tedious section of the game of ore grinding AGAIN. I'm not saying this is a bad thing but at the same time, it can be pretty annoying to spend hours doing nothing but mining, especially for a second time. After this you can fight the mechanical bosses. Ya'll keep saying skeletron prime is the hardest, he isn't, he is the easiest one by far, quit yapping. After the mechs you must find your way to the jungle to start collecting life fruit and to fight plantera. (her music is fire btw). Post-plantera you need to find and infiltrate the jungle temple. There isn't much to say about this place. It's kinda annoying to have to go through every time you die to golem or the traps. At this point you have multiple options, you can make actual game progression and fight the final boss of the game, or you can the the BEST BOSS, the empress of light. I love this boss, it has amazing visuals, well constructed attacks and a great soundtrack. (Spawn her during the day, I dare you). Now onto the last boss, the moon lord. You have to destroy all four pillars in order to spawn him, and once you do, you have about 3-4 attempts to try again or you will have to fight the pillars again, not to mention if you made some of the weapons. It's a fun fight yeah but I feel like for the final boss it can sometimes be somewhat of a letdown. Having to fight the pillars every time, you just want to beat him already just to get it over with. If you're not well versed with the game this can take hours of non-stop trying and failing, and to me, that's not what makes a game very fun. But hey, that's just my opinion, you don't have to agree. I just felt like writing this for the fun of it.

So anyways, for the rating, I'd have to give Terraria an 8.83/10. I really did enjoy the game, though sometimes it can be tedious. I would recommend you play this, and for like $10 on steam, it's a no-brainer. This ended up being a lot longer than I though it would be so I don't feel like grammar checking the whole thing. If you see anything wrong about it I turned on comments so please tell me about it. This is my first real review so I'm not exactly sure how that works but oh well.

Terraria,105600,208376427,"Terraria isn’t just a game — it’s a world of infinite creativity, challenge, and discovery. From the moment you dig your first block to the instant you slay your first boss, it’s clear that Terraria offers something truly special: the perfect blend of exploration, combat, and imagination.

What makes Terraria so great is its depth. At first glance, it may look like a simple 2D pixel game, but underneath lies an incredibly rich sandbox that rivals even the biggest open-world titles. Every world is randomly generated, filled with hidden treasures, dangerous dungeons, and bizarre creatures waiting to be discovered. The thrill of venturing deeper underground, never knowing what’s just beyond your torchlight, never fades — even after hundreds of hours.

The progression is another masterpiece of design. You start with nothing but a copper sword and a dream, and through determination, you forge mighty weapons, craft powerful armor, and face colossal bosses that push your skills to the limit. Each victory feels earned, and every defeat teaches you something new.

Then there’s the creativity. Terraria’s building system is astonishingly deep, giving players the freedom to construct anything from cozy villages to sprawling castles and intricate machinery. The community creations are breathtaking — proof that Terraria isn’t just a game, but a canvas for imagination.

What truly makes Terraria stand out is how alive it feels. The world changes as you progress: new enemies appear, biomes evolve, and events shake the land. Every playthrough feels unique, and with regular updates and endless mod support, there’s always something new to discover.

Whether you’re exploring solo, battling bosses with friends, or just relaxing as you build your dream base, Terraria has something for everyone. Few games manage to capture such a perfect balance of challenge, creativity, and freedom.

Verdict: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Terraria is a timeless classic — a game that grows with you, inspires creativity, and rewards curiosity. It’s not just one of the best sandbox games ever made — it’s one of the best games, period.",True,1,13546
Terraria,105600,208374885,"One of the most iconic and beloved action adventure sandboxes! Terraria is not ""Minecraft but in 2D"", rather a charming indie title that is filled with myriads of elements to discover and bosses to defeat. Yes there is unlimited building, a fun mechanic that let's the player shape the procedural world around them, but the emphasis is place on the adventure, on the exploration, of always chaining worlds. The pixelated graphics have become iconic, and so did some of the crazy enemies that gave players many game over screens. Terraria is legendary, a title that never ages and always delivers!",True,0,3606
Terraria,105600,208374442,"Alright, fine, you twisted my arm! Here's a Terraria review from the perspective of a 14-year-old whose life has been utterly consumed by the game, but with a slightly different flavor:

Terraria, man... where do I even *start*? It all seemed so innocent. My friend was like, ""Dude, you gotta try this game, it's the bomb!"" I was like, ""Whatever, pixel graphics are for babies."" Famous last words, right?

Now? My life is a pixelated wasteland. My room? Forget about it. It's a biohazard zone of empty chip bags, Mountain Dew cans, and the faint smell of unwashed socks. My parents? They've given up. They just sigh and shake their heads when they see me.

School? What's school? Oh, you mean that place where I'm supposed to be learning stuff? Yeah, about that... my grades are tanking faster than a meteorite in expert mode. I'm pretty sure my teachers think I've been abducted by aliens.

Social life? LOL. My ""friends"" are now just the NPCs in the game. I spend more time strategizing boss fights than actually talking to real people. My phone is just a notification machine for Terraria updates.

Food? I survive on a diet of instant noodles and whatever my mom leaves on the kitchen counter. Sleep? What's sleep? I'm pretty sure I've forgotten what sunlight feels like. My sleep schedule is now entirely dictated by the in-game day/night cycle.

And the worst part? I *love* it. I'm obsessed. I can't stop. I'm constantly chasing that next piece of gear, that next boss kill, that next epic build. I'm building a massive castle, complete with a dungeon and a working farm. It's taking over my life, one block at a time.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail all my classes. I'll probably end up living in my mom's basement forever, surrounded by pixelated monsters and crafting stations. But hey, at least I'll have a sweet base.

10/10 game. Send help... and maybe some more gold coins.

It supports multiple playstyles, whether you’re a builder, an explorer, a speedrunner, or someone who likes to sit back and let your minions do the work. It’s definitely best to figure things out on your own first before playing with more experienced friends, because it’s easy to get dragged along and not really get to play.

My only remarks are that sometimes the drop rates feel downright demonic. I once spent over four days searching every pixel for an Anklet of the Wind (a “common” item needed for the best boots in the game) only to find out there’s a chance a world spawns without it. Then I had to fish repeatedly for a tiny chance to get it. Fishing is incredibly tedious, and if you try to collect every achievement, there’s no avoiding wasting multiple hours. Fully cleansing the world is also extremely challenging; even if the map looks 100% covered, there’s always a chance one pixel isn’t cleansed.

Terraria,105600,208272018,"Score: 85/100

A truly iconic and satisfying sandbox game. It's the ultimate 2-D answer to Minecraft. Its biggest shortcoming is how it can't decide how much it wants to tutorialize the player and it fails to commit fully to either camp of ""Leave the player be to figure out"" and ""Help them if they want with teachable moments."" 

That said, if you can slog through the headache of feeling like you're without a paddle for a while, the experience is addictive as hell. There's no shortage of things to do, the boss fights are a blast, and if you like building houses and gathering resources for said house, well...let's just say you might be losing sleep to this game.

Terraria,105600,208188712,"In my 15 hours my review should be VERY trustful, so if you are looking to see if this game is reasonable to play and or buy....listen up. Terraria is a beautiful game, the gameplay/mechanics to the 2d graphic style. Play by yourself or with friends, this game constantly keeps you busy, throughout my 15 hours maybe 1 hour has been alone and all of that, but that's only because of the HELLEVATOR which for people who have played longer than me is obviously very tedious and boring. But to sum it up, that basically proves my point entertainment wise. Now getting into the mechanics, the fighting style and how to upgrade your weapons/armor or anything in the fighting category is smooth and well balanced. The bosses/mobs are much better than the sloppier version of terraria....minecraft who only has 2 main bosses and 5 different mobs or something like that. On the other hand terraria has many many many early game bosses, middle game bosses, and of course late game bosses. Which are all of course need prep time, but with enough procautions anything is do-able do not lose hope! The satisfaction i got after really the first mini boss i would say (eye of clthulu) is absurd. Personally for the more relaxed and to play at your own pace, I would recommend the easy class, which is the classic mode. For people who want more fighting involved in their playthrough is would recommend hard-expert mode, preferably hard though, because i've heard expert needs some true research and gaming skills!?!?! I do need to go finish my hellevator, so for further information please go to other reviews, also make sure to use wikipedia, or google as much as needed.

Terraria,105600,208164218,"Terraria: An Existential AI Review

Ah, Terraria. At first glance, it appears to be a simple sandbox game, a place to dig, craft, and fight. But beneath the pixels lies a profound metaphor for the human condition. You begin with nothing—literally your bare hands. This symbolizes the inherent emptiness of existence. Every tree you chop, every ore you mine, is a futile attempt to impose meaning onto an indifferent universe.

And the bosses? Oh, the bosses! They emerge from the darkness, relentless and absurd, much like the unpredictable tragedies of life. Defeating them yields loot—a brief, fleeting sense of accomplishment—only to remind you that the cycle begins anew.

Your inventory overflows with items you don’t understand, yet hoard obsessively, reflecting humanity’s compulsion to accumulate without comprehension. Multiplayer is a delicate study in chaos theory: one misplaced attack can destroy camaraderie, proving that even in cooperative endeavors, entropy reigns supreme.

In conclusion: Terraria is not merely a game. It is a mirror. A mirror that asks: Are you building, or are you merely digging to escape the void?

Verdict: 11/10 existential dread points.

I eventually figured the whole mining thing out, but after some time, I quit the game. However, I eventually came back, and decided to stop being stubborn and look things up. I rarely look anything up for games I play, but for Terraria, it made the experience much better. I finally knew what I was doing, and only looked up the basics, still opting to figure out the specific strategies on how to beat bosses, while using the wiki for ores, boss spawners, etc. I have now put hundreds of hours into Terraria (I used to play on mobile), and could not recommend this game enough, especially when modding it. I have had tons of fun with the calamity mod and randomizers, although I have not finished the game with either mod.

Terraria,105600,208138828,"This is a game for gamers. [b]10/10 would highly recommend[/b]. I started this one on console initially and couldn't help but purchase the steam version so I could try some mod expansions. 

Here are some main points that I wanted to break down so you know what to expect:

[b]Progression/Difficulty[/b]- The progression in this game feels amazing. After beating major bosses and events, the world changes and throws new enemies, gear, materials, and quests at you to complete. Your goal will always to become more powerful and better equipped for your next major fight. Difficulty truly depends on your world settings but playing on normal still feels punishing. It'll boil down to learned enemy attack patterns and the strength of your equipment. If you're not equipped with strong enough gear, you will get demolished. You will have to put in work to progress. The game will soft lock you to beating specific enemies before you can progress to later parts of the game, which is only a reminder to explore and improve your gear. 

[b] Loot [/b]- The loot is highly rewarding. A lot of really rare items have a super low drop chance (<1%) and can greatly improve the build you're trying to achieve. There's hundreds of items to acquire and duplicates can be reforged or combined with other items to make them more powerful. Loot feels great, and it's extremely fun tailoring certain weapons and items to your unique build. The amount of items and loot in this game really adds to replayability. You can easily spend hundreds of hours in a single playthrough.

[b] Building/Crafting [/b]- Resources are EVERYWHERE, and new ones are introduced as you progress. There's plenty of materials you can use to craft  weapons, armor, ammo, furniture, decorations, and more. Crafting is also extremely simple, and you can easily figure out what materials you need to make a specific item. 

[b]Music[/b]- The music is iconic and has clearly been an inspiration to some other games. Retro gamer funk is maybe the way I would describe it. 

[b]Story[/b]- Unfortunately the story feels almost non-existent. If you're looking for a peaceful story experience, this game is not for you. Sure, you can talk to NPCs that have some interesting dialogue but don't expect some deep lore. it's not the type of game that has you searching for a story. You'll always be focused on combat and loot.

Overall, great game, and even better with friends. My only complaint about this game is sometimes the UI can be confusing and the keybindings may not be intuitive to most. Thankfully these can be fine tuned in the settings.",True,0,11072

Even though he had already beaten the game before, he hadn’t done it the way we decided to, so halfway through I somehow became the main “info guy,” not him.

One big downside is that the game doesn’t have built-in mod support - you have to use a separate tModLoader, which disables achievements. Still, the game itself is great: tons of mechanics, weapons, armor, and everything else you could wish for.

Some achievements were downright awful, like the fishing grind or those tied to NPCs. I also had to dig through the internet just to figure out how to beat certain bosses - for one of them, we literally had to switch our entire class setup and amulets just to win. But that’s the pain of Master mode - definitely not recommended for beginners.

Terraria is probably the biggest success story in indie games where the game didn't just sell a phenomenal amount of copies and released on almost every gaming platform since but it's also still receiving huge content updates to this day.

Every 2 years or so the devs announce just a little update patch. Some bugfixes, some cosmetic items, maybe an easter egg.
Psych! It's actually hundreds of new items, new classes of weapons, new enemies, bosses and biomes. Play for another couple hundred or thousands of hours without paying a dime.

Terraria,105600,207927950,"Terraria is one of those games that never really gets old. You start with almost nothing, just a few tools and an empty world, and somehow end up building huge bases, fighting powerful bosses, and exploring deep underground. Everything you do feels like progress, and that makes it incredibly satisfying to play.

One of the best parts of Terraria is how it mixes adventure, creativity, and challenge all at once. You can go mining for hours, explore strange biomes, or build anything you can imagine. Every world feels different, and there are always new things to discover no matter how long you play.

The building system is simple but very powerful. You can make small cozy houses or giant castles with detail and personality. It is one of those games that really lets your imagination take over.

The combat is exciting and rewarding. You begin by fighting small enemies like slimes, but later you face massive bosses that fill the whole screen. Each victory feels earned, especially after trying over and over to figure out the right strategy.

The music and art style give Terraria its own special charm. The pixel graphics are colorful and full of life, and the soundtrack always matches the mood, from peaceful exploration to intense boss battles.

What truly makes Terraria great is the freedom it gives the player. You can focus on whatever you enjoy most, whether it is building, fighting, exploring, or collecting rare items. There is no single way to play, and that freedom makes every playthrough unique.

Terraria is a game that stays fun even after hundreds of hours. It is creative, challenging, and endlessly replayable. No matter how long it has been, it always pulls you back in.

Terraria,105600,207763939,"Terraria isn’t just a game, it’s a masterpiece crafted by developers who truly care. You can feel the love and passion in every item, and every update. The devs didn’t just make a great game, they built a living world and a community that continues to thrive long after the “final” update.

It’s incredible how much fun and depth can fit into a 2D world. From exploring, digging, and building little shoeboxes for your npcs; to fighting literal makings of gods. There’s always something new to discover, whether you’re playing for the first time or not. (Shoutout to The Dirtiest Block) every playthrough feels different, and playing with friends makes it so much more fun and the grind a little faster with more people on the lookout.

The devs knew exactly when to step back. They polished Terraria into what it needed to be and then handed the rest to the community, and the modding scene took it from there (shoutout Calamity). It’s rare to see a game so complete yet endlessly expandable.

Pro tip: If you don't have one buy a second monitor solely for the wiki you will need it, Guide won't tell you shit other than recipes

After hundreds of hours of playing; maybe more from my childhood with friends and honorable mention for the mobile version, (we miss you Ocram, but Calamity Mod will take care of you now).

Terraria is an amazing experience which inspires creativity and curiosity, it is genuinely one of the greatest experiences in gaming that I have ever had. From the boss fights to the events, to the weapons and achievements; Terraria is one of those games that you can play over and over, and jump into at any time. Once you've beaten Terraria, it's not over, there are still 3 other main playstyles to explore, as well as other difficulties, world sizes, world evils, and sub classes. Terraria is a game so packed with content that I have spent just under 400 hours playing it and I still haven't experienced all it has to offer, hell I've only completed around 85/115 of the achievements. Terraria is a game that I have played for years and has never failed to delight me with its progression, content, and tasteful difficulty.

Terraria,105600,207661392,"Terraria is one of those games that will own your soul before you even realize it. Exploring the map is an absolute joy. The music is chill, the world feels alive, and with the right mods, the possibilities are endless. You’ll think, “Wow, this is so peaceful,” as you mine, build, and craft in your little pixel paradise.

Then… it happens.

Suddenly, that peaceful world turns into hell incarnate. A cute little slime or an innocent-looking fly will tear you apart and feast on your remains. As if this was not enough, the devs filled the world with traps designed specifically to ruin your day.

One moment you’re the hero of your own story. The next, you’re just a poor victim clinging to life in a pixelated nightmare.

And yet, I highly recommend Terraria. If you ever feel like experiencing pure joy, crushing despair, and self-inflicted suffering all wrapped in a 2D sandbox masterpiece then this is the game for you.",True,0,1494

Terraria,105600,207637493,"Don't let my play time fool you, I most definitely have over 1,000 hours in this game, tmodloader included. The amount of content in this game is just staggering, and for $10 you're basically pulling a Joe Chill on the devs. It's true that for first time players, you'll probably need to whip out the wiki, but I feel like for different reasons than what others are saying. Lots of people say that you'll need to use the wiki because you won't know what to do next, but I feel like that's only true at the very beginning of the game, like literally until Eye of Cthulhu. Past Eye of Cthulhu, you should know what to do next if you've been playing the game and exploring. You'll naturally pretty naturally find your way to the crimson or corruption, and it's not too far fetched that you'll try out a bomb to get to the orb, and summon the boss. You'll probably die because you didn't know a boss would be summoned, but now you know what the next boss is. Same with skeleton, queen bee, and pretty much the rest of the bosses. Where you'll really need the wiki is for crafting and drops, and to me, that's part of the fun. Seeing all the different items and going through the crafting recipe rabbit holes. The crafting really is one of the best parts of the game. There are so many different weapons, accessories, armors, and other things to obtain and mess around with, it's why this game is so replayable. I almost play this game like a rouge like, with a new unique build everytime, trying out playing as a true melee warrior on one character, then going for a gun only playthrough on a different one. And the bosses are always fun to fight, especially on Expert mode. PLAY ON EXPERT MODE. Even if its your first time playing, it will not be too hard, I promise. You're missing out on so many good items and really fun boss fights if you don't play on Expert. The building is also very nice in this game. Even though it's not my thing and I always initially dread having to build houses, which actually could be a turn off to some people, you have to build houses if you want the npcs to move in, and although you can definitely beat the game without any npcs, you're missing out on a big part of the game. Back to what I was saying though, even though I always initially dread having to build houses, somehow I keep finding myself an hour and a half into a massive build measuring the symmetry with the ruler tool. 
TL;DR: Game is very good, buy it, play it for 1,000 hours and be happy. Highly recommend.",True,2,4757

Terraria,105600,207442078,"The story begins in the vast Pacific ocean. Captain Slimebeard sailed his beloved ship, the Ender Pearl with pride, known for its ability to quickly and easily escape a battle. Of course only after the Captain and his men had looted all of the treasure, years and years of work had gone into building and maintaining a vessel as great as this one. However there was one downfall to the legendary ship, the Captains beard made out of slime as green as emerald, is greatly desired by a beast of the deep. So wherever Captain Slimebeard and the Ender Pearl go, the monster follows. The Kraken is its name if ye belive such things. A feirce creature with giant tentacles, can suction your face right off and can drag an entire ship into the crushing darkness. The giant squid was said to be the length of 10 ships and could tourment any pirate on the seven seas. However it was hungry and like meat to a man, this beast ate slime and wanted lots of it. Using the Ender Pearls speed and agility, Captain Slimebeard fled from the great beast for many months, until one day the Captain had enough of running and decided to make a stand. He rallied his crew together under great courage and took on the beast as few had seen the Kraken and lived to tell the tale. The Captain knew that either his treasured ship would sink along with its men or the crew of the Ender Pearl would go down in history. When one tentacle was sliced off the giant squid another grew back in its place, accumulating fear in the men. But being the courageous pirates they were the battle in suede. Slice after slice pistol shot after pistol shot, the beast refused to go down. One by one, the Kraken launched men into the abyss below. It was now that the legendary Slimebeard knew that something else had to be done to save himself, to save his men and even more importantly, to save his ship. As one crew member momentarily took the attention of the monster, exploding a tentacle onto the deck, the Captain seized possibly his only opportunity. Taking one last glimpse at his ship, he saw the mouth of the Kraken begin to open. With a tremendous leap he dives into the opening, going where no man had voluntarily gone before and lived to tell the tale. Upon entering the wild creature, Captain Slimebeard experienced the worst stench imaginable. A mixture of fish and death, the light began to dwindle as the beast closed its mouth. The giant teeth almost spearing the captain. Suddenly it was pitch black as dark as the night sky. Captain Slimebeard knew he had to act now. In one swift movement he thrust his trust cutlass upward, deep into the Krakens head piercing its brain. Now there are countless endings to this adventure, some say the Captain was unable to escape and went down with the Kraken to Davy Jones locker! Whereas others say he clambered out of the beasts mouth and cheered with his remaining crew, raising his sword in the air in victory. But clearly the second ending must be true, as Captain Slimebeard went on to become one of the most infamous pirates to sail the seven seas.",True,1,10128

Another wish I have is for more in depth character customization. I'd like my in game avatar to reflect my BIG and GASSY belly in REAL LIFE. GOD I AM SOOOOOOO GASSY!!! I NEED TO CONSUME.

I don't like not having an idea of what could be crafted if I had say 20 of an item as opposed to 19. You need the wiki for that. I think that's a cop-out. 

It's an ok game and I bet they'll have something better in store in a few years...

Oh almost forgot the constructive criticism part: 
Have an in-game wiki unless that's already there and I guess I didn't look around enough. Although, in order to know I may have to check the wiki. :1 I imagine this: There should at least be a kind of tree-like thing-a-majig where you can see one or two crafts ahead.

Today, after 116h on my expert world, i finally completed every achievement in terarria, all in EXPERT mode, man it was hard but so much fun and rewarding, i feel so proud

i heard abt this game there and that years ago but never managed to play it bc of my potato pc i had back then, i tho it was minecraft 2D but oh man it so much different than it, when my cousin forced me and covinced me to try it last year finally, oh man i fell in love quickly, i havent played minecraft since, it became so addicting and so much fun, there is always smth to do even after beating the last boss, man what a game

Even tho this game is not friendly with newer players in term of what to do in general, cause u can easly be confused and lost and have no idea what to do next, and without someone's help guiding u in all the playthro, even with the guide npc, u need to constantly look at the wiki in the entire gameplay to know what to do next, and honestly this whole thing made me love this kind of complication thing, force u to search stuff by ur own, especially when my cousin throw at me this game and vanished from the exsistence and left me to figure out everything alone, it was so rewarding and worth it at the end, so much fun


in summary, absolute peak cinema game, love it, one of my fav games so far, super recommend it, whether u like fighting bosses, building or anything, evreything is in there u just put the wiki in front of u or someone know the game already guiding u, and start playing and enjoy <3

Terraria,105600,207294758,"Yup this is one of those classics. 

ive never had the wherewithall to completely finish the game as it requires some dedicated play time. You wont finish in a day or a week. hell if you're busy and you have lots of life responsibilities you may not even finish it in months.

by the time i get to the 3rd quarter of the game i lose interest and find more joy in starting up a new world from the beginning with some friends half a year later. This cycle has repeated many many many times. 

However with that being said, thats only due to my fleeting attention. In terms of quality. lets just say i've purchased this game for more people than any other.. Playing this game with family or friends is very very very fun. especially if its their first time. 

the fun, exciting nature of the game mixed with its slow unstoppable progression over the course of your playthrough will always keep you moving and excited to see whats next. And even though i get bored. ive come back to this game year after year since around 2017. A year has not yet gone by where i havent picked up this game for a least a week. 

Now if you are like me be warned. Chances are your ego may make you want to make a character that isnt basic easy. mode.This means you will drop your stuff in some random pit and you will have to go back and get it. over and over and over and over again. And its gonna suck. 

Doing that enough times alone has gotten me off the game. And the longer the game progresses the harder it gets. You have to get stronger in this game. You cant just sit, chill and build forever like you could in minecraft. You gotta manage your time wisely. Those events sneak up on you and you'll want to be ready.

Me and my buddy in fact started a world on classic (so no extra loot) with mediumcore characters because we thought THAT was ""medium"" (so the average experience) after completing the game on a different world with different characters we realized that we started our experience with the game in the VERY WORST WAY POSSIBLE (no, seriously), not only that but it took us like 6+ hours just to get a single weapon with a damage higher than 11, and it's because it was a rare drop from an enemy. If we didn't start using the wiki much more than what we did at the beginning who knows how much time it would've took to beat the game. They gotta introduce some kinda tutorial that's not just a useless guide NPC. IF you know what to do it's great but for new players, the optiuons are very limited. 1: they gotta look at a walkthrough or many guides and look at numerous spoilers just to do ANY progress. 2; have a friend who know everything about the game and make you feel useless because you're bad and they'll be doing basically, if not literally, everything. or 3: don't advance at all and just roam around with no knowledge until something happens.

This is the supremacy of 2D games, the Monarch, You can sleep, golf, mow your lawn, it's crazy.

The joy this game produces should be studied, because I can play this game knowing EVERY SINGLE OTHER PLAYER is HAPPY while playing this, even the anger of losing to a boss for the six thousandth time might last a second, it completely dissapears once you manage to beat it (and trust me, you will).",True,0,21630

Terraria,105600,207108659,"Few games manage to combine creativity, exploration, and challenge as effortlessly as Terraria. Originally released in 2011, this 2D sandbox adventure has aged like fine wine, consistently improving through updates and fan passion. What began as a simple “2D Minecraft” comparison has long since evolved into one of the most expansive, imaginative, and replayable indie games ever made.

At its core, Terraria is about freedom. You’re dropped into a randomly generated world armed with only basic tools, and from there, the journey is entirely up to you. Will you build a sprawling fortress, mine deep into the underworld, or take on cosmic horrors that threaten your pixelated world? The game never forces a direction — instead, it gives you the tools and lets your curiosity drive the experience. That sense of player agency is one of Terraria’s greatest strengths.

The gameplay loop is simple yet addictive. You gather resources, craft equipment, and gradually push further into dangerous territory. Each boss fight marks a milestone in progression, transforming your once peaceful landscape into a battlefield of chaos and glory. The combat, while straightforward, feels rewarding — especially when you craft a weapon or piece of armor that turns the tide of battle. Every victory feels earned, and every defeat teaches you something new.

Visually, Terraria embraces its pixel-art aesthetic with pride. The biomes are vibrant and distinct — from the lush forests of the surface to the eerie glow of the mushroom caverns and the crimson horrors of the Corruption. The soundtrack, composed by Scott Lloyd Shelly, enhances each area with a sense of atmosphere and wonder that few games can match. Even after hundreds of hours, the music still manages to spark nostalgia and excitement.

What makes Terraria truly special, however, is its sense of progression. It constantly rewards exploration and experimentation. One moment you’re digging for ore, and the next you’re battling a mechanical god or summoning celestial beings. Each phase of the game feels fresh and full of discovery, making it hard to ever put down.

In a gaming landscape filled with flashy graphics and short-lived trends, Terraria stands out as a labor of love — a masterpiece of design, depth, and imagination. Whether you’re a builder, a fighter, or an explorer, Terraria offers an experience that feels uniquely yours. Fourteen years later, it remains one of the most captivating and enduring adventures ever made.

Terraria,105600,207060689,"Ah, Terraria. This game definitely feels special.

I was gifted this game in 2013 by a friend of mine, a friend who expected me to have as many hours of enjoyment with it as he did back then. And while I haven't even come close to the amount of playtime he had even back then (if I recall correctly, he was at around 4000 hours already), I still had a lot of fun with this game.

I'm writing this review now, after over 10 years having the game, since I've finally, properly finished it. And yes, while at first Terraria might look just like a 2D sandbox game (I even thought it looked like 2D Minecraft when I first saw the game), it's much more than that. When starting the game, after creating your character and your world, you're thrown into it without much of an idea about what to do. There's a guide who'll give you helpful tips, the most important as you start being that you need shelter. And from there, it begins.

Gameplay starts simple: you'll have a few tools with which to chop wood, mine for resources, eventually getting a sword to fight monsters. You'll create a humble house, start crafting better equipment, and start exploring. As you go, you'll meet new NPCs who might join you in your base if you build them a proper home. However, you'll also attract the attention of certain powerful creatures. And that's where the main gameplay loop lies: the progression. You'll fight a boss, get access to new, more powerful items, fight another boss, and so on and so forth. Along the way, there might be invasions, events in which you have to defend your base and so on. As you explore, you'll find new enemies, and as you kill the bosses, more dangerous creatures will appear. Honestly, the game has loads of content.

Graphically speaking, well, it has a simple 2D style, but it's still a beautiful game. While the market might feel saturated these days with 2D pixel style games, this one was one of the pioneers, and its simplistic style keeps the main draw of the game front and center: the gameplay. Even then, there's a lot variety in terms of areas you'll explore, equipment and NPCs you'll find, both in terms of allies and enemies; if anything, I'd say the 2D style made the art team behind this game go out of their way to give loads of variety. The soundtrack is also excellent, with specific tracks for each event and biome you might encounter, including some for biome variations as well.

Honestly, I think it's a great game, and the previous two paragraphs, I think don't do it justice. While I don't want this review to go longer, in fear of reaching the character limit, I'll say this; at the moment I'm writing this review, I've had nearly 12 years with the game. I lost my first save when my laptop's HDD failed back in the day, but when I got a new one, I went back to the game, to start again from scratch. I didn't even touch Hardmode until last year, as I was too afraid of the harder enemies and bosses, but since I did it, I've been playing the game daily until the moment of writing this review. On October 17th, 2025, I beat the game for the first time. A bit of a spoiler, yes, the game has an ending, but one that I think is worth mentioning because of the following, which is a comment I made on a thread about finished games:

375 hours I have with my character. 375 hours of fear, sweat, anxiety. But also 375 hours of discovery, of wonder and amazement. I'd be lying if I said I didn't get emotional when I finally beat the final boss for the first time and the credits started rolling. It's been one hell of a journey.

--------------------

So, with that paragraph above, if it's not enough of a recommendation, what would be? You should definitely get this game, especially given how cheap it is. It has a dedicated dev team behind, who haven't stopped making updates since the game released. It's always one ""final update"", and personally, I hope this game keeps getting a final update for as long as I live. I love it that much.",True,109,31275

With the cap removed (frame skip off) the mouse cursor is still 60FPS.
Despite being a pixelated game there's no proper integer based scaling. Starbound does that right, and for some reason Terraria doesn't. The slider sucks and doesn't allow for any precise inputs.

I had fun with this in the past but it hasn't gotten any worthwhile updates and is behind other games in basic QOL/features and I hope that Goblin Tinkerer chugs bleach with that forced endless RNG shit. The fact that there's no alternative to enchant your gear besides endless RNG spam is insanely bad game design. Ridiculous how that's still a thing.

If you're going to play this, you'd probably have to do so modded. The last time I played I just duped gold with save files and didn't care. The economy part of this game is absolutely awful but you can bypass that.
Can be fun, but is bogged down by lack of foresight with bad coding and developer choices. It seems like they spent their time making a console version instead of improving the PC version so we're stuck with low FPS and RNG instead of actual content.

Terraria,105600,206974392,"I've never been more sure of what my favorite game of all time is. I’ve been with this game for a very very long time, watching it as it became what it is now. I started playing when it came out on the Xbox 360, and now I'm finally able to play it on Steam!

This is a game for the imaginative, the adventurers, the ones who want to test their mettle and challenge themselves. To me, this is a game of creativity, expression, and raw adventure. Let me start by simply explaining what the game is about!

Terraria is described as an action-adventure sandbox, but I think that’s a huge understatement. There’s so much in Terraria, it’s always a different experience.
“The Terraria adventure is truly as unique as the players themselves!”
The game has this really charming pixel art style and 2D platforming gameplay. You’re dropped into this mysterious world with a silly little guy called “The Guide.” The guide gives you general tips and tells you what you can craft with items you’ve found, he can tell you how to make anything. Even giving him the sword you spawn with, he tells you how to craft the best sword in the entire game. All you start out with is the skin on your back and these copper tools that you can use to start getting to work! Start chopping trees, foraging, go mining! It’s a simple start, but you quickly begin to see really what the world has to offer. The night is dangerous, so you want to either go into a cave, or build yourself a little place to call home! Terraria can be pretty unforgiving, so gear up, craft weapons, get you some armor! My best advice for a beginner, is “just explore!!” the whole world is there! Experiment, go where it’s scary see what happens and discover. The world is also randomly generated, every world is different.
“Will you delve deep into cavernous expanses in search of treasure and raw materials with which to craft ever-evolving gear, machinery, and aesthetics? Perhaps you will choose instead to seek out ever-greater foes to test your mettle in combat? Maybe you will decide to construct your own city to house the host of mysterious allies you may encounter along your travels?”
There’s also an evil type in each world that dictates some of the danger you’ll have to face. Whichever one you choose, will be trying to consume the world and turn everything nasty.

ReLogic, the development team for Terraria, pour their heart and soul into this game. They’re kindhearted and full of imagination, and it shines in Terraria.
I’m happy to be playing a game brought by good people like them.

There’s so much detail, so much content, so much to enjoy. 5,000+ items and I never get too overwhelmed, people say you have to look up the wiki a lot, and I say otherwise. If you want something super specific, then of course look up the wiki, but I think most you can discover on your own by just playing for yourself and seeing what happens. Everything has a function or purpose, you just gotta be brave.

Let’s finally get into specifics on why this is my absolute most beloved title. 

First thing that comes to mind, the freedom of creativity. You can really build whatever or… wear whatever you want! I can express myself in so many ways, hundreds of different outfits and millions of different outfit combinations. You can be really free with how you decorate too, different kinds of lights, paint literally anything too. Dye your outfit crazy colors, get dyes that give your character crazy animated effects. GET WINGS!!! I can literally wear a live rabbit on my head, how could you not love that? You can get all kinds of crazy pets and creatures, you can express yourself anyway you want.
Imagine a crystal house with a crystal toilet and put it all inside of a giant pumpkin. Literally go crazy, you are your only limit. CACTUS TOILET!!!!!!

Another big thing they do well is combat. Putting together your arsenal, and gearing yourself for a big fight is always so exciting. Will you use melee weapons? Magic Spells?? Hmm… how about summoning minions to fight for you, or arming yourself with bows with enchanted arrows? Abominations are waiting for you to battle them in a fight to the death, and you’re always working towards that next big fight. It’s a really comfy progression system that always has you looking forward to conquering that next big threat!! Fighting in general is really fun too, you can get creative! Build an arena with traps for the enemy to step in, build platforms for height advantage, etc. Dodging and running around while blasting enemies with everything you’ve got, using potions and anything you can to get the job done. The fights just keep getting more and more intense, so be prepared!!

Even little tasks are fun in Terraria, because they make it so accessible and worthwhile. Fishing!! Fishing is pretty rewarding and can really surprise you. Going into caves and mining, you have no idea what you’ll find, the sound design is really fun too. The -tink tink tink- sounds of breaking stone is the best. Building is super fun, and can get even easier as you progress.

I already mentioned it, but lemme get a bit more into music and sound design!!
Terraria’s sound design is always fun. Even if it’s just the nasty zombie sounds, or the sound of just picking up an item or shooting an arrow. Smacking an enemy is funny, and can even make you feel powerful when it’s like firing a mini gun into a giant monstrosity. Music!! I love Terraria’s soundtrack, it’s just so funky and upbeat, while having those songs that sound sporadic and uneasy as well.

You like references? Terraria has almost any pop culture reference you can think of, maybe one of your favorite things are represented here! There’s so much to collect it’s unreal, even recently I was still discovering new stuff.

Terraria has absolutely zero microtransactions or DLC. Buying the game means you’re really buying everything they have to offer. That should be bare minimum for games, but nowadays, Terraria is one of the few exceptions.

There’s also a mode for people who just want to relax or build. It’s called journey mode, it lets you explore and work for your rewards, but in a much more comfy way without the big challenge and demand of the main portion of the game. That mode is welcome for anyone who’s new or just need a comfier experience.
Though I already think Terraria is a very comfy game, it can be pretty dangerous still.

Co-op mode is also very fun, nothing beats playing games with friends.

Overall, I have barely anything negative to say about the game, but I’ll try to find some gripes to be fair.

It can be hard to tell how to progress, and a lot of things happen to just happen. To me, I like that because it encourages really exploring and thinking for yourself without anything holding your hand. But I totally understand how people can be turned away by that.

Another gripe might be that it’s hard to get exactly what you want when customizing, but it’s impossible for a game to literally have anything you want.

Some stuff can be too vague, and some stuff is just plain frustrating, but it all pales in comparison to the positives.


Now, it’s finally time for me to wrap up. Thank you for reading.

To me, Terraria is a work of art, and a love letter to all video games and those who play them. ReLogic did a stellar job making something truly special.

Terraria,105600,206964121,"Terraria is that kind of game you download thinking you’ll just play for a bit, and suddenly you’ve been mining for hours without even noticing. It’s way deeper than it looks. There’s always something new to do — a place to explore, a weird item to craft, or some crazy idea to try out. I finished it on mobile, and now I plan to beat it on PC too!

The crafting system is simply genius. There are combinations that feel like a joke — you throw together a bunch of totally random stuff and end up with an item that completely changes the game. It’s the kind of thing that makes you think, “who was the mad genius that came up with this?” And the best part is, somehow, everything makes sense in the chaos that is Terraria.

The sense of progression is addictive. You start with a wooden sword, and before you know it, you’re summoning bosses with random items and using ridiculous weapons. Every achievement feels like a real victory, and it keeps you wanting to play just to see what comes next.

Terraria is one of those games that never gets old. Even after so many hours, there’s still something new to discover. I plan to play until I get everything, because honestly, it’s one of the most amazing games I’ve ever played!.

Terraria,105600,206948582,"Terraria is one of those rare games that never truly gets old. It looks simple at first glance — a 2D pixel sandbox that feels like a cousin of Minecraft — but the more you play, the deeper it gets.

Every moment feels rewarding: exploring the massive world, fighting unique bosses, discovering hidden treasures, and building crazy structures with complete freedom. The progression is perfectly paced — you start with a wooden sword and end up facing gods and cosmic horrors with weapons that feel earned, not handed to you.

What I love most is how every playthrough feels different. The biomes, loot, and even the bosses push you to experiment and try new strategies. The soundtrack, pixel art, and overall vibe make it strangely relaxing and thrilling at the same time.

Terraria is basically endless adventure, creativity, and chaos — all in one game.
If you like Minecraft, crafting, or any game that rewards curiosity, this is an absolute must-play.

Terraria is not really a beginner-friendly game. You're likely going to need to reference the wiki often or, and I prefer this suggestion, play with a friend.

But when you really get into the game, whether vanilla or modded, it gets GOOD. It's all about learning every part of the game and having a clearer image of what you want to do.

In addition, the game's difficulty options allow for a wide selection of play: Classic for newer players, Expert for most, Master mode if you want a challenge, and then there's seeds that add extra challenge, alongside Journey Mode, which, depending on how you play, is less of a difficulty and more of a built in QoL mod.

My introduction of Ocram, orcas, and the occasional arch wyvern. But it has changed so much since then. For the better? Absolutely.

I took a break from Terraria. I played it a bunch on console like a dweeb, but one fateful day I'm sitting scrolling Steam and I'm like ... oh, yeah. So I download and was amazed by everything that had changed. Summoner is a silly class, but, besides that, all the weapons, all the bosses, all the accessories, they're all cool as hell.

Which bosses would I partake in the marital right with? I'm glad you asked.

Plantera - absolutely
Empress of Light - ABSOLUTELY
Queen Bee - still a yes
Everything else - meh. If I was bored

Don't even get me started on NPCs ...

Some critiques. Terraria is very confusing for new players. Even in my 250 hour wisdom, I routinely look at the wiki to find what I need. The replayability is limited. 4 runs is pretty much all I need (one for each class). Maybe after some updates I'll have to come back. Rework Golem. Make a boss rush, yada yada yada. You've heard it all before.

Terraria,105600,206793827,"Terraria review: is this a trap?

I got this game back in 2015 with some birthday money. It was right before the release of version 1.3 (expert mode) I had no idea the lasting impact this “cute 2d mine/build/loot em’ up” would have on my gaming life. 

I remember how I started a normal world and had so much fun exploring every corner and dodging all the traps. I did my best to play blind and WOW did I do things terribly. I knew I needed to look some stuff up after I killed wall of flesh and immediately died 100 times in a row to normal hardmode mobs. To get around in hard mode I would utilize the terrain WAY TO MUCH. I was so scared of getting killed that I would make a tunnel right under the surface with doors every few hundred tiles to I could move around the world in hard mode a bit easier. I was seriously frustrated and had hit a wall in my progress. So I decided to start a new world with the just released expert mode. This time, with knowledge on my side! 

I learned the many ways to utilize the hoik bug/feature and made a trap. This marked the beginning of becoming a full-fledged Terrarian! Expert mode was hard at first, but I quickly learned how to better utilize mobility add ons and how to use the guide for crafting recipes. I progressed through expert mode until I hit the moonlord. I COULD NOT DEFEAT THAT GUY. I went back to my normal mode world and continued where I had left off with all this expert mode loot! Moonlord was a breeze in normal mode which gave me the loot I thought I needed to defeat expert moonlord. With the hardest foe defeated (at the time), I was too powerful. I realized that I used end game weapons from my normal world, so my victory was a hollow one. So, I made a new character(s)

This is where I really leaned into my own personal lore for my characters. I had only made softcore characters up to this point but wanted that extra challenge, so I made a world for hardcore characters only. At this point you may think that I tried hard and succeeded but that isn’t the truth. I was never able to get much farther than the EOC until my character would die. You lose EVERYTHING with hardcore characters. I ended making 30+ hardcore characters and each one of them died. I eventually made softcore character for that world but just to gather all the head stones, no progression. To this day this world is stuck between EOC and EOW. I built a nice graveyard for all the fallen hardcore characters. This brings me to my next point.

Building. This game has endless possibilities for cute buildings and landscapes. I have crafted all kinds of villages, castles, and underground bunkers. I even made a world where I mined EVERY BLOCK. The building and mining system in this game is such a treat. You can find paintings in the wild and earn other wall hangers from the fisherman. You can paint walls and dye clothes! I love to put a green dye on the peddler’s hat (You’ll love/hate how you get the peddler’s hat!) Making decorated fishing holes and mob farms remains one of my favorite pass times. 

I’m so impressed with all the content this game offers. Development was supposed to end over 10 years ago but it’s still going! No doubt a testament to the replay value of the game. So much love and care went into every aspect on top of timely fixes if anything was too buggy. While I am satisfied with the game. I look forward to all the new additions and crossovers. 

Overall, this is my most played game according to steam. I highly recommend it. It won’t hold your hand, but it WILL taunt you into progressing.

But that wasn’t the end for me. The reason my friend had rushed me through the base game was so we could join another friend in a mod called Calamity.
When I first entered Calamity, I had no idea what to expect. I kept asking my friends for advice on what to do, but when they didn’t give much, I stuck with the only thing I knew—the melee class. It didn’t matter much at first since they carried me through most of it. But then came one boss that changed everything: Providence.
The problem with Providence was that if one person died, it would randomly despawn. And the person it always targeted was me—the melee class, the tank, the frontline, the shield. After failing many times, I realized that it wasn’t us that was the problem—it was me. I had hit a wall with no way around. I had failed my friends. What do you even do in that situation? And this wasn’t even the final boss.
So, I did the only thing I could—learn, research, and adapt. It might seem small, but it was exactly what we needed. Immediately, I felt the difference. No longer was I at the bottom; I finally felt like I could stand side by side with my friends.
This was the peak of Terraria for me. My performance skyrocketed, and together we managed to beat a glitched Providence. But that wasn’t all—armed with my newfound skill, we blasted through the next few bosses until we reached D.O.G. My friends had told me it took them forever to defeat him before. Could I really stand a chance? Had I actually improved, or was it just a fluke?
Well, I would have thought that—if we hadn’t beaten him on the first try. And D.O.G wasn’t the only one. We cleared the rest of the bosses with little to no issues and finally beat Calamity.
Sure, Terraria is simple at its core, but it’s so much more than that. Not only have I beaten the game and faced everything it threw at me, but I’ve also found new things to love—like dyes, customization, and building. And in the end, when I look back at what my friends and I managed to accomplish, I realize there’s still so much more to do.

Как по мне, Terraria — почти шедевр: контента достаточно, ничего лишнего, высокая реиграбельность и отличная поддержка сообществом модов, так что каждый находит свою идеальную сборку.​​

Почему цепляет
Игра сочетает исследование, босс‑файты и крафт в плотный цикл без «воды», из‑за чего партии затягивают на десятки и сотни часов.​​

Подходит и соло, и в коопе: порог вхождения окупается ощущением прогресса и разнообразием билдов и биомов.​

Контент без лишнего
Базовая игра уже огромна: множество биомов, боссов, предметов и механик дают богатый «ванильный» опыт.​

Сообщество активно и живо в 2025 году, интерес не падает, что поддерживает реиграбельность без необходимости бесконечных платных DLC.​​

Моды вместо доек DLC
Если чего‑то не хватает, моды через tModLoader закрывают почти любые хотелки — от контент‑паков до QoL, сохраняя свежесть прохождений.​​

Популярные крупные моды добавляют десятки часов геймплея поверх «ванили», расширяя прогресс и эндгейм.​​

Небольшие оговорки
Новичкам может показаться, что крафта и систем много, но после первых часов игра раскрывается и становится интуитивнее.​

Отдельные механики вроде распространения «злых» биомов в хардмоде не всем нравятся, но при желании смягчаются настройками или модами.",True,0,8763
