Hollow Knight,367520,210570337,"Its good, but it is also a bit overhyped. I'd rather recommend Ori 1 or Ori 2, but I had fun playing Hollow Knight. It gets a bit tedious, sometimes. 7/10.",True,0,2158
Hollow Knight,367520,210565514,"Hollow Knight is an incredible game.

When I first bought it, I wasn't sure whether I'd like it. I had never played any metroidvania before, never even any game featuring proper platforming!  I was far from good at the game, but it was just so captivating that any time I failed, I had no intent to give up. I still remember fighting [spoiler]Hornet for the first time[/spoiler]. That was the moment I fell in love with the game.

The combat is just so much fun. It never gets boring (as you can see by my playtime...). The music is wonderful. I haven't kept count of how many hours I've spent just listening to the soundtrack, but it's definitely quite a lot. 

I have never challenged myself in any game as much as in this one. I think beating [spoiler]Path of Pain[/spoiler] is where it all started. First that, then suddenly it was [spoiler]radiant Hall of Gods, radiant Hall of Gods again? Then the third time...? Look, beating bosses hitless is a lot of fun. And then, my greatest accomplishment, which took me almost half a year - Panteon of Hallownest with all bindings at once. It was a painful process, but I don't regret a single minute of it.[/spoiler]

To sum it up - the game is a ton of fun. It has a lot of content and is ABSOLUTELY worth the price. Now that Silksong is out... I will still be coming back to Hollow Knight from time to time. As amazing as the sequel is, Hollow Knight will forever stay in my heart, just now with Silksong alongside it. Thank you Team Cherry for this masterpiece <3",True,0,50191

The Deeper I went into Hollownest the more intrigue I was for discovering, and this is why finding the most recondite place or looking for fake walls gets so exciting and rewarding.

There are multiple endings you can obtain, lots of things to collect, a multitude of bosses and enemies, and plenty of optional content to give you a challenge; oh yeah, challenge, this game is hard, if you don't like that, don't play. 
Hollow Knight does NOT hold your hand so you may get mad at times. Things are shown rather than told most of the time

Not to mention, the OST is absolutely beautiful and so is the art direction, you can really see it in the world building, the story was quite interesting to experience. I found myself getting really captured by this game's atmosphere and multiple times would I get distracted by something interesting while I was going to do something else.

Hollow Knight,367520,210142678,"I feel it is my moral and legal obligation to file this public statement about Hollow Knight. Not about the gameplay, which is excellent, or the art, which is stunning, or the music, which is so good it briefly made me forgive a sentient maggot for consuming its weight in mystery goo. No. I am here to talk about something far more alarming.

The Grubfather is an unmitigated disaster of a parent.

Let us begin with the setting. Hallownest is a labyrinth of OSHA violations so severe they belong in textbooks under the heading ""How to Fail at Civilization."" There are:

1. Bottomless pits with no railings
2. Spikes stored in quantities appropriate for medieval torture museums
3. Platforms that move, crumble, or explode depending on their emotional state
4. Acid pools placed directly beneath common walkways
5. Elevators that operate under the guiding principle of ""hope nothing is underneath""

And in the middle of this carnival of workplace safety nightmares, the Grubfather decides that the best place for his hundreds of extremely fragile larva children is scattered randomly across the kingdom like collectible trading cards.

These grubs are not even hidden in safe places. They are shoved into the walls of spider dens, tucked behind warriors who fight like caffeinated wasps, or placed in jars right next to explosive creatures that sneeze napalm. If you pitched this childcare strategy to any responsible adult they would call the guards.

The Knight, an unpaid intern by all appearances, is the only one doing anything about it. This tiny bug-paladin is the sole employee of Hallownest Child Protective Services. Every rescued grub cheers with pure joy. It is heartwarming. It is also damning. These children have clearly never experienced consistent care, supervision, or even a moderately secure storage solution.

And what does the Grubfather do when you bring his kids back? He sits there slurping, showering you with pocket change like a grandfather who forgot Christmas, occasionally coughing up trinkets of questionable origin. I have seen vending machines with more emotional range.

As more grubs return, the noises coming from his house grow louder. I will not attempt to categorize these noises. My therapist insists we avoid using the word ""eating,"" but if it wiggles like a grub and sounds like a blender filled with pudding, I reserve the right to raise an eyebrow.

Hollow Knight is incredible. It is one of the best games I have ever played. But let the record show that the Grubfather is either the worst parent in recorded history or a creature who treats parenthood like a gacha mechanic. In any functional kingdom, he would already be on several watchlists.

Still five stars. The grub rescues alone are worth every minute.

Would I recommend the game? Absolutely.
Would I recommend leaving children with the Grubfather? Only if you enjoy weekend-long expeditions through OSHA’s personal vision of purgatory.",True,0,1360

Hollow Knight,367520,210045736,"Hollow Knight is a game that speaks to one’s heart.

It makes you rage, it makes you feel like you have lead fingers, and it makes you want to give up everything at once.
But it pulls you back, again, and again, and again.

I only have 40 hours in the game so far, in the past 2 weeks, that’s how much I’ve logged, but the lore, the emotions, the story have all hit me like a truck, even if I haven’t yet finished it. Thank God I avoided all media of Hollow Knight, because it makes my playthrough so much more enjoyable.

Now, let’s talk about some moments that really spoke to me.

When I first took out the False Knight, I felt a wave of joy in my soul. I was genuinely happy for taking out a worm.
When I fought Hornet, I raged so much because of her fast attacks and my greediness that it helped me learn to be patient.
When I finally beat the Mantis Lords after like 5 attempts, I was happy that I could figure out how to read patterns and play to them.
When I came back to Myla after the Soul Sanctum, I uh, I broke a bit, to be honest. The only thing I wish I could do is have an item to stop it before it’s too late for our singing bug.
When it all turned orange (which is where I am right now) I realized I need to hurry up and clean out the attic.

Hollow Knight is a game that makes you feel so much emotion, so much joy, pain, and happiness, that it feels unreal.

I genuinely thank Team Cherry for this game, and I can’t wait to finish it by dancing with a moth (whatever that means, courtesy of a friend, @LoopaDoop).

Hollow Knight,367520,210021125,"I just completed my first playthrough and I now realize why this game has been recommended to me for years.

Pros:
-Combat is so fluid
-Boss battles are fun and can be learned (except for a couple that NEED certain charms/powerups)
-Asymmetrical Story Line (fun, but also a con)
-Music is phenomenal
-Artwork is pheonmenal
-Regular enemies are easy to understand
-No ""hand holding""
-VERY challenginging

Cons:
-Assymetrical Story Line (I got lost and didn't know where to go/what I needed in some parts)
-The start is a slog, but gets really fun once you get some abilities
-Some 'dialogue' is annoying

I didn't enjoy the game in the beginning. The story is super convoluted and I needed a lot of Lore videos to understand what I just played. The story is not easily told, or understood. The limited abilities/movement in the beginning had me very, very confused, but once we got about 10 hours, or so, into the game. I was quickly addicted and couldn't get away. 
I used the 5 days I had off of work to ""beat"" this game for the first time, and do not regret it at all!
Overall, I give this game a high 9/10 or 10/10. I had a great time with this game and only completed it with 69%. (no joke, couldn't make that sh** up) Some things got very difficult, and having no direction can get confusing, but when things click and you remember things you can traverse that you couldn't in your first hours, the games starts coming together quickly. 

With that done...I can now go try to 112% the game.

The hand-drawn art, haunting music, and subtle storytelling create an atmosphere that stays with you long after you stop playing. Every area feels like a piece of a fallen kingdom still whispering its history, and exploring it is equal parts beautiful and melancholic. The combat and movement are tight, precise, and deeply rewarding. Progress isn’t handed to you, you earn it, step by step, room by room, sometimes triumphantly and sometimes stubbornly. Yet that struggle makes every breakthrough feel genuine. The game trusts the player, and in doing so, creates a bond rarely seen in modern titles. What truly sets Hollow Knight apart is the emotional journey: the loneliness, the perseverance, and the strange warmth found in unexpected places and characters. It’s a game that doesn’t need to shout; it speaks softly, and that’s what makes it powerful.

TLDR: An unforgettable experience and a must play for metroidvania fans and newcomers alike.

I understand. I finally understand why this game has the fan base it does and why Hollowsong hype reached unbelievable levels leading up to release. Hollow Knight is a journey that tested my perseverance at multiple points, sometimes edging close to me questioning if I should throw in the towel. HK kept me enthralled with its incredible world building and the deep satisfaction earned by overcoming whatever roadblock I was stuck on. Admittedly my history with metroidvanias is very limited, but I'm eager to dive deeper into the genre after this.

HK wastes zero time getting you into the game, a theme that was persistent throughout my 45 hour playthrough. It rarely takes control away from the player and when it does, it does so briefly and for good reason. The story and world are there for you to engage with at whatever level you desire. There is a lot of interesting lore and backstory to Hallownest, the ruined subterranean kingdom you explore. What HK does even better is its character, enemy, and boss design. There are literally over 100 enemy types, each with unique and interesting designs. The bosses are simply a delight to fight thanks to their presentation, creative move sets, and of course, the music. When the Dung Defender first dives onto the screen I could not contain the huge grin on my face. Other bosses like Soul Master and the Mantis Lords are excellent examples of showing rather than telling when it comes to defining a character's personality.

The world of Hollow Knight is the true star of the show and is incredibly addicting to gradually explore as you unlock more abilities in typical metroidvania fashion. I was originally worried about environmental diversity given the game takes place underground for almost the entire duration, but the developers do an excellent job mixing things up. Biomes feel unique but also fitting and sensible whether you are in typical rocky caverns, crystalline tunnels, a literal underground city, dense jungles, or more. You have to purchase each biome's map from an NPC in a specific location in that biome. This map gives you a basic layout, but requires further exploration if you want a complete map. I think this is great, although I am less of a fan of the map not updating until you sit at a bench. I could also take or leave the fact that you cannot see yourself on the map unless you use up a charm notch, but it is not the end of the world.

Okay, the combat is also the star of the show. What can I say, this show has a lot of stars. Hollow Knight's moveset is initially very simple since you are left with basically just a nail to swing, a heal, and the ability to move and jump. That is literally it, but as expected with the genre, you will gain abilities as you explore such as a dash that can be upgraded to allow traversal or even damage, spells, special nail attacks, and more. Techniques such as pogoing, in which you use the momentum from striking downwards on an enemy below you to keep yourself in the air, further add to the game's depth. Beyond that you have charms which, when equipped, give special bonuses or even abilities. Charms have a notch value and you are limited in how many charms you can equip by the number of notches you have, although this can be upgraded. This forces you to make decisions about which charms to use and it is common for different setups to work best for different bosses. All of this comes together when you are engaged in boss fights with arenas and tactics that test your aptitude as the Hollow Knight.

The music is unsurprisingly fantastic, but the sound design, especially for the enemies and NPCs, is really creative. Entombed Husks and Flukemons are particularly notable for how disgusting they sound, perfectly fitting for where and what they are. The only things I found lacking were a few platforming sections and some annoying enemies, usually of the flying variety. I think flying enemies as a baseline tend to be a nuisance, but certain ones like Primal Aspids and Crystal Hunters take this up a notch while also being found in tougher platforming sections.

These moments are fleeting and increasingly rare as you, the Hollow Knight, become stronger. By the end of my playthrough I felt nearly unstoppable outside of the most challenging boss fights. This game came a long way from its beginning as a game jam project on Newgrounds, which was considered a bad game at the time. I am going to let a little time pass before I dig into Silksong, but I am very excited for my next taste of Team Cherry.",True,1,2656

Hollow Knight,367520,209946054,"Honestly, does this game even need an introduction? its an awesome game made by 3 Ausies with pure love and joy, like what more could you ask for?

Its a metroidvania and a good one at that. There is constant backtracking, which some people might find annoying, but it only makes it all the more rewarding if you actually remeber where youre supposed to go.

The fights are very challenging, but not too hard eighter. If youre expecting dark souls level bosses, then you might be slightly dissapointed, as it wont take you hundreds upon hundreds of attempts, but youre not gonna beat them on your first try eighter. Very well balanced if you ask me.

The fighting system is good, as its not just the same thing over and over again. There are many different bosses, but also many different spells that you collect throughout the whole game, so you dont get overwhelmed at the start, but your options expand over time (then again, most people dont use them unless its requiered).

What this game excels at however, is the movement system. Similarly to the fighting system, you acuire new mechanics as you progress and it even makes the fighting in the game feel way better when you know how to use each move.

Overall, i couldnt recommend this game enough. I think everyone should try it at least once. A lot of people lose interest before they even get to greenpath (second main area), which is a real shame, but if it really doesnt entice you enough to keep playing, then maybe metroidvanias arent for you.

Hollow Knight,367520,209912126,"I haven’t fully finished the game yet, but I’m at about 96 percent. This review is mostly for players who are trying to decide whether to get Silksong or Hollow Knight first.

I recommend starting with the first Hollow Knight because Silksong is a bit harder. Learning the basic mechanics in the first game will help a lot before getting into Silksong.

One nice thing about Silksong is that it has no DLCs yet, so going for full completion feels more straightforward. In Hollow Knight, there is the main 100 percent game and then three extra DLCs. If you like to play without guides or spoilers, those DLCs can be harder to find and complete.

Basically, try the first Hollow Knight before Silksong. It will make the experience smoother and more enjoyable.

But why write about a game's flaws in a positive review?

So, let me get something straight: I came to Hollow Knight with high expectations (it was my friends favorite game before the sequel released) and it DID NOT dissapoint.
Hollow Knight is a brilliantly crafted metroidvania. The biomes are really fun to explore with little trinkets hidden around every corner. Every ability that you get feels like it really improves your movement/combat.

The bosses are very unique and certainly have a different style than in most other games. I think they flow nicely though.

The game has charms which allow you for near-endless customisation of your abilities to suit your playstyle.

The music is also great, with the best biome tracks being [spoiler] Crystal Peak, Soul Sanctum and City of Tears [/spoiler]
and my favorite boss tracks were [spoiler] Hornet, Mantis Lords, Sealed Vessel and The Grimm Troupe [/spoiler].

The story is fascinating, but you'll probably need to watch a youtube video to understand it. I'll admit it's not told that well.

What else is there to say... the game is really pretty, that's for sure.

Oh yeah, Hollow Knight has several endings, plantly of achievements and side quests, so I wouldn't worry about replayability.

Yeah, in conclusion, it's a great game which I really enjoyed. Definitely recommended and [i] please [/i] don't give up at the first area, it's the least interesting place in the game and I promise it gets way better after the first... hour? 1,5 hours?

one more thing that really surprised me in the game was in deepnest. you have bugs crawling out of the ground, massive centipedes walking along their paths, you descend and descend. everything wants to kill you. eventually, you make it across one big hole. you dont know whats at the bottom. you cant see, its very deep. you take a plunge into the unknown, ready to slay the beasts that stand in your way... instead what greets you is a peaceful respite. a hot spring, a bench, a safe place to rest. a comfy little checkpoint before moving on deeper into the horrors of the deepnest.",True,0,2374

For how difficult the bosses are (<- that's good) benches are extremely far away (<-that's bad) you lose half your HP before you even reach them. And you can't even practice them in anyway before that. Half of the journey is travelling to the boss rooms.

The nail arts are so inapplicable in an actual combat scenario it's basically just there for show. You can hit them once per hard fight if your pre-prep it before you get there and that's.. that's it...

Backtracking is INSANE, and the fast travel is *extremely* limited. It is also extremely unclear where you should go in this game, one wrong step and poof enemies just delete you or you're in a boss room without even knowing. It reminds me of the SNES times where you needed a booklet with a guide to backseat you the entire game.

Hollow Knight Review

Hollow Knight is honestly a fantastic game, though at first, I wasn't that impressed. In the beginning, the gameplay feels pretty basic and you don't have a lot of skills or flashy abilities. The early upgrades you find aren't too challenging to get, so it can seem a bit simple at the start.

But once I got deeper into the game and started encountering the bosses, everything changed. The bosses are one of the best parts of the experience—they’re interesting, memorable, and really elevate the exploration. I also realized I was playing with the DLC already included, which added even more depth. It took me over 30 hours to beat, and I enjoyed nearly every minute.

I do wish the game had a few more ways to experiment with different weapons—like maybe a big axe or some kind of ranged weapons, bows, or arrows—just to add a little variety. And maybe having more bosses per area would be nice for even more of those epic fights.

Overall, though, it's a fantastic indie game from a small studio, and I’d easily give it a 9 out of 10—maybe even a 9.5. It's memorable, it's great for what it is, and I absolutely recommend it.",True,0,2572

Hollow Knight,367520,209775848,"The TLDR of Hollow Knight is simple: It's an extremely high quality Metroidvania that is well worth the price.

It reminds me of an old school Blizzard game in the way that it doesn't do a lot that's really new or boundary pushing, but instead takes a grab bag of familiar and popular elements and combines them in a satisfying way all while polishing them to a mirror sheen.

This game is a 2D action game with light RPG elements and medium platforming elements.  The game is one big interconnected map where exploration is gated behind abilities found after either boss battles or exploration.  The light RPG elements are most similar to Zelda: A Link to the Past - extra health and mp nodes, new spells, and new weapon techniques.  The RPG elements may go a touch further with charms that can enhance basic stats like damage to a degree.  This enables a basic ""build"" customization system, albeit one that is simpler than many other metroidvanias and 2D souls likes. 

Two elements of the game stick out as the best it offers: The combat and the Music.  
     The combat features some extremely precise controls which allows for precision maneuvers.  The arc of your jump is controlled by how long you press the jump button and the same precision is applied to your horizontal movement as well.  Bosses have contact damage and fair hitboxes, therefore fighting them often requires the precision offered by the controls.  I found the combat challenging but not unfair for the most part.  Admittedly, I didn't bother with the vast majority of extra combat challenges, only a few of the extra dreaming bosses added in by the DLC.  I fought Grimm a few times but never beat him.  I unlocked the more powerful dream nail but didn't complete the white palace.  I only unlocked the most basic ending.  When the time came to start finishing those big end-game challenges, there were two matters of personal taste which turned me to the direction of choosing to move onto another title on my very crowded.  I'll discuss those when I talk about the weaker parts of the game.
     The music of this game is excellent, and it combines with an overall great sound design that actually has a noticeable effect on the gameplay.  Musical cues are often present to provide the player a cue to what's happening, and even when the music isn't working towards that, the tracks are all extremely high quality.  The only aspect of the sound-design which I don't care for is the deafening of the sound when struck in combat.  In a similar fashion to the much maligned ""red vision"" (although not nearly as bad), I find the hollow knight ""black vision"" after taking damage to be a tad too distracting.

Now we'll deal with what are, in my subjective opinion, the weaker aspects of the game:  The story and the art design.  
     I'll get the art design out of the way first.  I first want to recognize that I don't in anyway believe it's half-assed or poorly conceived.  It was very intentionally designed, it's consistent, and its themes show through in basically every area.  The problem is that it's just not for me.  It's a simplistic bug theme that fell through a Tim Burton filter and then landed in a Dark Souls ""decayed kingdom"" pit.  That was just never going to resonate that strongly with me, but I can admire how much work (especially given the team-size) went into making the most of they have.
     I wish I could bring that same level of grudging praise to the story, but alas, I don't find the ""story"" near as defensible.  The story is a poor Dark Souls rip-off that is transposed onto a bug kingdom instead of a traditional sword and sorcery setting.  The NPCs who are part of the ""plot"" speak in basic riddles, but most of the NPCs don't know wtf is going on with the plot because the plot is practically non-existent.  You're a non-talking amnesiac in another fallen/ruined kingdom that suffering from a spat of corruption.  It's the same damn plot as every Dark Souls game and every wanna be Dark Souls game.  It's another ""lorey"" a ""story"" that is told almost exclusively through Lore about the past, rather events in the present.  Also, I'm very tired of try-hard ""tragic"" NPC stories where you save a bunch of NPCs only for them to die in the end.  That elicits little more than a shrug of my shoulders.

So the story not being compelling was a big reason that I didn't bother with the extra-end game challenges, however the second major factor is my general dislike of difficult platforming.  This is in no way a knock against the platforming of Hollow Knight.  As far as I can tell, Hollow Knight's platforming is high quality as those things go.  I just consider difficult Indie platformers as a niche that is not mine.  I tried Super-Meat Boy and didn't care for it.  I never bothered with Celeste or any other highly regarded Indie Platformer.  It's just not a genre I care about.  None of the platforming in this game gave me serious pause until I got to the white palace, which is one big platforming challenge.  The other endings are gated behind this challenge, and because I don't care about the story, I didn't bother trying to achieve those additional endings.

Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time with the game.  If you like 2D Dark Souls type games, traditional 2D action games, or Metroidvanias, this game is probably for you and certainly worth its price.",True,0,2717

Hollow Knight,367520,209746598,"I really wanted to like this game, but this is probably the most overglazed and overhyped game of all time. It is regularly called the ""Souls-like Metroidvania,"" but a better comparison would be to call it the Fortnite of Metroidvanias becuase it's not really that deep, but appeals to mainstream gamers who aren't really that deep into the Metroidvania genre, or gaming as a whole. And don't get me wrong, this game is fun at times, but it excels at nothing and is rather bland as a whole. If you are looking for a visually striking, creative and innovative Metroidvania with challenging or even souls-like combat, play Blasphemous or Symphony of the Night instead. This game is not that, contrary to what others say.

As a Metroidvania, it is probably the most shallow and uninteresting Metroidvania I have ever played. The level design is extremely repetitive and bland, The exploration appears open yet lacks any vision and ends up being largely linear and involves you often walking in circles until you find a hidden door you missed. There is very little movement growth, really only getting a dash, wall jump and double jump. Back tracking is not rewarding because by the time you get anything out of it you've already run through the same area 10 times already. The environments also lack visual clarity and often look more or less the same screen from screen. While some Metroidvania's make more use of the map than others, A large portion of this game's upgrades are just adding rudimentary features to the map like showing your cursor on the map or marking merchants on it. This really isn't much of a Metroidvania as much as it is a walking simulator because the movement is so slow and you spend so much time trudging through the same areas over and over.

As a Souls-like, the Combat is extremely shallow and a complete letdown. Combat in it's entirety really just boils down to just mashing a single button and has virtually zero depth. Parry timing is extremely tight and while it does nullify a single instance of damage, it's ultimately better just to button mash and deal damage than it is to strategically bait out a parry. Dodging provides zero Iframes and is purely a traversal tool here, further limiting combat to this passive game of chicken where you run in, mash, run away, repeat. Even among Metroidvanias, which to be frank, usually have lackluster Combat: Hollow Knight stands out as exceptionally repetitive and bland in virtually every aspect. The only reason this game gets called a souls-like is because it has corpse running (IE: Death = you must recover your body or all your currency is lost) and because it has a parry button. Controls are sluggish and the opposite of tight. Frankly, calling it a Souls-like is an insult to Soulslikes.

The Art style and Lore seems to carry this game in the eyes of many, but to be honest, that is also rather basic and shallow. Character sprites are minimalistic, bland and even when they are distinct from one another, there isn't much interest to them. The NPC's also have virtually zero dimension to them, so there's not really any reason to be invested in them or their (non-existent) stories. Assets and Backgrounds don't really match in terms of style or level of detail. Characters have thick, blocky lines and no shading or detail whatsoever, while backgrounds are highly detailed, shaded and static.

If I didn't get this game for under $5, I would probably really disappointed. It's not a terrible game, but there are flash games of equal or superior quality from like 2008 both graphically and mechanically.",False,2,2157

I've rarely seen this kind of storytelling, where you are given nothing but hints and clues as to what is happening. Most games I've played will give a background on the main objective or the overall story, or the story will be made apparent to me about half-way through the game. However, this game has its story hidden in the world around you, and you'll have to pay attention to grasp some semblance of understanding as to what is happening. This game was the first time I actually had to take notes. Like, pause the game, think about what happened, and write about it in my notes app. And I've still got no clue as to what's happening!

A Metroidvania with a lot of collectibles, many and hidden areas to discover and explore, to get stronger, and to progress more and more. I was surprised at what things one comes across when just wanting to explore an area, giving some pleasant surprises which I've liked a lot.

The difficulty felt very fair to me, most bosses being done first try, but there were quite the exceptions among them which forces the player to go into serious mode. Some challenges which require some good skills, a good balance between comfortable gameplay and required focus to overcome the harsher tasks.

I delayed to finish the game simply because it was fun to still look for what I couldn't solve until that time, only looking up one thing, and two to confirm my thoughts. Beating it to 100%, one can say I've found 99% of everything myself, and it felt good and rewarding.

The soundtrack fits very well into the entire game's atmosphere, gloomy and sometimes beyond, making it a pleasant game for the ears as well. 

There's only one and odd complain I have about the game.

Hollow Knight,367520,209649744,"Like many others say, the game is good enough until you realize how unforgiving the checkpoint system is. Most reviews I see talk about this. You reach the first really tough boss, end up losing over and over again and are reset to a checkpoint that is miles away to walk all the way back and try again.

This is a souls like game that instead of offering you retries, punishes you for dying. Oh you lost? Now walk all the way back from beginning. Also you lose all your upgrades until you reach the point where you last lost. Then HOPE you don't die again to waste more time traveling back to the fight AGAIN.

IT's a cute game, good music, good graphics, fun game play. AWFULLY unforgiving checkpoint system with no retry option for tough battles. Quality of life is VERY low on this game. I may not play again for a long time if ever. I've wasted my money.",False,2,562

Hollow Knight,367520,209648710,"I've never played a metroidvania game before. I thought I wouldn't like it, but I love it.

The art design is beautiful. The characters, the animations, the scenery, the soundtrack, the ambience, and the voice acting are just perfect for the playful, but melancholic atmosphere of Hollow Nest, which I would argue is a little gem of world-building by itself. It's what carries the game most.

As for the game-play, its very snappy and satisfying, clever at times. Given its difficulty reputation I feared it would frustrate me. Surprisingly, despite some off-putting moments, it didn't. Yes, there are parts of the game where dying can be a bit too punishing (i.e. large distances or lengthy sequences after the last checkpoint), some where the difficulty spikes way above average to almost ridiculous degrees (e.g. [spoiler]the last stage of The Coliseum of Fools[/spoiler] or [spoiler]the saw section of The White Palace[/spoiler]), and some where it seems a bit of a filler (e.g. traveling way too many times to the same, unluckily distant, already visited places). Still, I wanted to discover the world and its story so much that it didn't bother me. On the contrary, I thought the harshness of it fit the setting.

I have a habit of playing games that require good timing and coordination, so don't be fooled: it is quite challenging if you're a casual player. But don't let that discourage you. :-)

My only gripe with the game is that there are a few points where it's almost impossible to figure out how to progress without taking a look at a guide or spending enormous amounts of time retracing steps and guessing possibilities because it's hinted nowhere near well enough. I did the former, but I guess the latter is part of the appeal for some.

Hollow Knight,367520,209642997,"Late to playing this game, since I initially overlooked it due to it not being my typical style of game. I got caught up in the Silksong hype and decided to finally give it a try first.

Just about finished with the main story (going for the True ending) and have to say, I understand the hype. I'd easily add it to my top 5 games list, and love so much about it, from the gameplay and controls, to the atmosphere, story, and enemies. I'll admit, it's difficult (and rewarding) and I'm definitely not very good at this style of game, but through all the deaths at boss battles, I can't stop coming back. I don't think I'll be the person who does all the rematches or toughest battles in the game (who knows, many have likely said that), but I've enjoyed nearly every boss and challenge, always wanting to come back to finish it, no matter how many times I've died (similar to how I feel about Cuphead). 

My only caveat, is it is not one of those games that gets easier as you go, even with new abilities. It stays difficult, which I think is good, but not for everyone. If someone comes into this expecting an easy adventure, this is not the right game for them. Just good for people to be aware of that, but if someone wants to take the time to learn and explore what Hollow Knight has to offer, and has the patience to struggle through it, it is so worth it.",True,0,2832

TLDR; fuck you read the damn review

Hollow Knight is a metroidvania. About bugs. I hate bugs irl, which makes it ironic for how much I adore this game. Everything is perfect. The combat is fluid and swift once you master it, the platforming is satisfying and rewarding to learn, exploration is direly important, and in mix with both combat and platforming, is consistently rewarding to collect one of the 44 charms, 3 spells and 3 upgrades, 3 nail arts, 6 materials for the nail upgrades, multiple skills to discover more, and countless items, currency, and rewards.

The fallen kingdom of Hallownest is both charming and enigmatic, and is a wonder to explore. The kingdom and its inhabitants, from the somber Dirtmouth, to the beautiful capital, to the harrowing Deepnest, each area is able to get you immersed into it, and asking yourself about its history prior to your  entrance. Every area has many secrets that will require players to use the platforming, combat, or just their curiosity to discover and learn about its lore.

Each npc, vendor, and massive variety of enemies are all masterfully crafted. Even the smallest bits of dialogue from the most unimportant character will reveal a new piece of the puzzle to solve the mystery of what happened to this kingdom. Vendors, even when uncharismatic, will still grab your attention and will make you want to learn more about their backstory, or at the very least, what they have to offer. Enemies will range from cute little guys to intimidating beast, the masterclass warriors.

All 44 bosses (besides like 2 of them) are engaging and majestic, each one requiring you to learn and adapt to their movesets to survive the encounters you'll have with them, ranging from passionate rituals, to savage brawls, to skillful duels, and emotional clashes to decide the kingdoms fate. No boss truly dissapoints.

Of course, none of these aspects could shine as brightly as they do without being accompanied with Christopher Larkins's divine soundtrack. No area, enemy, character, or scene is accompanied with an unfitting theme, all soundtracks are able to elevate each moment to the grand stage of your mind.

Spent like 20 minutes writing this review, so you know its worth it. More effort than I put into most of my assignments.

Please play this game, it has left a permanent mark onto my life, as the best 15 dollars I've ever spent, and [b] my favorite game of all time. [/b]

Hollow Knight,367520,209547193,"This game is a lot of fun, with the music, atmosphere and and art style being the big standouts for me. Combat is great too, for the most part, and the story and lore is interesting, if deliberately opaque and inaccessible. My biggest problem with Hollow Knight is that some parts of the game seem designed to be annoying and to waste your time. I'm mostly talking about boss run backs. Just for example, putting 3 platforms in the corridor leading to Hornet in Kingdom's Edge to stop you from getting to her in one crystal dash is just obnoxious. Some bosses have a lot of enemies you have to fight to get back to them every time, but I don't mind that as much as the ones that just take a lot of time to get to, because Team Cherry wanted to do some atmospheric story telling on your first go, and decided that shortcuts for subsequent fights weren't something that they wanted to do (looking at you Nosk.).

I think that deliberate opaqueness is a part of what makes progressing through the game feel interesting and engaging, but it can also create needless frustration. Never communicating certain movement options to the player can make some parkour sections really hard, and make you feel like an idiot when you do figure it out. 

Also, the lack of player character choice regarding interactions with certain NPCs baffles me, as do some of the arbitrary restrictions placed on who you can and cannot kill. Team Cherry has a very deliberate experience they want to create, and sometimes that can take you out of the game when you can't do X thing now because they want you to experience Y later. This can be pretty jarring sometimes.

Despite all of the above, I really like Hollow Knight. It's probably one of the best games that I've ever played. Most of the things that annoy me about it seem to be deliberate choices on the part of the developer, which I respect even if I don't like. Buying a game like this for 8 euro is very very reasonable. So far only Skyrim LE for 16 euro all those years ago has been better value for money. Some people say that a playthrough will take 20-30 hours, but given that I'm 53 hours in and think I still have another 10 at least to go before I reach an ending, I'd take this with a grain of salt.",True,0,4173

GOOD GOD THIS GAME IS AMAZING. I have played it pretty much everyday for the past 2 weeks, it's all I can think about when I'm away from home, it's insane. The gameplay is so smooth and easy to pick up on, and the combat is fluid and fun.

You can tell the devs put a lot of heart and soul into this game, there's so much content it's almost overwhelming.

The soundtrack is probably the best part in my opinion (already bought that too). It's a gorgeous, melancholy score that perfectly accompanies the different areas you travel to throughout the game.

The soundtrack is incredible. Every area has music that perfectly matches its atmosphere, from calm and mysterious to tense and haunting. It really pulls you into Hallownest.

Gameplay is where the game shines the most: tight controls, challenging but fair combat, and exploration that constantly rewards curiosity. When you fail, it’s on you. When you win, it feels great.

Summary:
Forge your own path in Hollow Knight! An epic action adventure through a vast ruined kingdom of insects and heroes. Explore twisting caverns, battle tainted creatures and befriend bizarre bugs, all in a classic, hand-drawn 2D style.
-------------------------------
What is in the game:
Hollow Knight is a huge Metroidvania where you explore the vast kingdom of Hollownest and discover its history. It has a giant main quest with a ton of side quests and side content you can find with a lot of different bosses and enemy types.
-------------------------------
Thoughts:
I regret putting this game off for so long. This is the best Metroidvania I have played so far in trying out the genre. It has amazing gameplay that feels fun and challenging, amazing visuals, great music, a huge amount of content, and a really cool and interesting world and story. While there aren't many recurring characters in the story, the few there are are all likable and all feel unique. I really like the way it tells the story, where most of the time it leaves it up to your interpretation and doesn't tell you stuff directly. The game is just really goddamn fun; I couldn't put it down. While I didn't get ALL of the content because I just didn't really want to do the stuff that was left, I put off finishing the game to get to 108% completion with all the side content before doing the final boss, and I highly recommend doing side content if you play this game too. I also likes how doing the side content all mostly felt natural, I barely had to search up how to find anything, and what I did was just me forgetting some stuff from the beginning of the game. Overall, please try this game at some point; the overwhelmingly positive reviews are there for a reason.
-------------------------------
Mid PC Optimization:
This ran at 400 fps constantly; you shouldn't have any fps issues with this game.
-------------------------------
Time to Beat:
~20 hours for just doing the main content, and probably ~40+ for 100% of the content (actually 112%).
-------------------------------
Price:
☑ Buy it full
☐ Wait for sale
☐ Don't buy it
☐ Free
For the huge amount of content, amazing quality, and indie team, I 100% think you should buy Hollow Knight full price.
-------------------------------
Graphics:
☑ Amazing
☐ Good
☐ Average
☐ Bad
☐ Awful
The art is simply amazing; all the animations look great, and the environments all feel unique and are beautiful. And very importantly, I feel like this game never has environments that make the enemies kind of blend in; you will never miss enemies because they blend in. I feel like I can't really do the art justice; just look at the store page screenshots.
-------------------------------
Gameplay:
☑ Very Fun
☐ Fun
☐ Meh
☐ Bad
☐ Awful
The gameplay just gets more fun as it goes on; it's a rewarding challenge. At first, I'll be honest, it starts a little slow, but after maybe 2 hours, it starts clicking more as you get more and more abilities. Exploring the world is great, and all the enemies feel unique. Side content is all fun, and you actually feel like it's worth doing, unlike a lot of games. I also feel like this game is just really clear with where you need to go; I rarely got lost, and when I did, it was just because I'm stupid. I also like how the side content added in updates doesn't feel too tacked on; it feels like it was always there for the most part. Overall, it's just a really fun Metroidvania that makes you just want to keep going and keep exploring.
-------------------------------
Music:
☐ Amazing
☑ Good
☐ Average
☐ Bad
☐ Terrible
☐ None
The music is really nice; while there isn't much I'd listen to on its own, there are some boss songs that are absolutely amazing, the music in areas is all good, and there are enough tracks to keep them from getting repetitive. Overall good, and it really elevates the game and fits it.
-------------------------------
Bugs:
☑ None that ive seen
☐ Not impactful
☐ Negatively affects gameplay
I don't think I ran into a single bug the whole game, well, except for all the insects.

Here is some things about hollow knight:

Hollow Knight is a 2D action-adventure game set in the vast, ruined insect kingdom of Hallownest, where players explore a non-linear world, battle strange creatures, and uncover the secrets of a mysterious infection. The game features classic Metroidvania gameplay, where players control a small bug-like creature to explore, collect abilities, and defeat bosses. Key elements include a focus on hand-drawn art, a challenging combat system, and a detailed, atmospheric world with a haunting soundtrack.

Once this game opens up, there's so much to explore, background lore to discover, and fine tuned game mechanics to master and fall in love with. It was hard, but fair.

After the release of Silksong and the step up in challenge it provided, I decided to get the game again for PC and see what it was like to return once again. The result is that I discovered how much better I had gotten at it than I realized. I could actually do Steel Soul quite easily, get the speedrun achievements, and finally try the pantheons. After a week, I have 100% a game I was certain I never would.

Ultimately, I can't recommend games by Team Cherry enough. I think they have a knack for using their gameplay to teach you all you need to know. As someone who had over 30+ attempts on certain bosses the first time he played this game can attest, it's possible and you don't have to be lucky.

i´ve come to this game because of the release of hollow knight silksong.
the fact that this game is only developed by 3 people and they could create such a masterpiece is stunning.
this game also is really hard and the whole point in it is to die,respawn and get your loot again, and then you know how to play the area.
this metroidvania is so beatiful 
there are different endings based on how you played the game and the game rewards you for exploring the map with new actions.
it may seem like the combat isn´t that hard, but with time it gets more complex.
in my opinion the best 15 dollars i´ve ever spendt.

Hollow Knight,367520,209395940,"8/10. Don't get me wrong this game is absolutely amazing in so many ways. I think team cherry knows what they're doing and are a great studio in so many ways. However, with that being said i think this game does have certain small balancing issues that make no sense to me. Like, for example, my last experience with this game was suffering with the mantis traitor boss. It took me at least 30 attempts of constant fighting and the boss fight was unfair through and through, mind you this is an optional boss that unlocks nothing actually useful and provides no meaningful benefits to fighting. Now, the hollow knight, one of the only non optional boss fights in the game, with the same equipment, same charms, and same everything took only one attempt.

Hollow Knight,367520,209382100,"This game is so much fun, but it seems like it desperately doesn't want you to find that out.

I tried to play this game numerous times after it looked so fun in clips I saw of various bosses, but the start was just so confusing and boring that I struggled every time. I felt like I was looping through samey corridors with no idea where I was supposed to be going. I believe this was my fourth time trying to start Hollow Knight, and I told myself that I would just stick with it until I hit that good point, and it finally came.

Once you get past the rough start, this game is extraordinary. Simple but challenging combat, loads of satisfying movement options that you unlock throughout the game, a really cute art style, and tons of secrets to find across the world. I found myself really really enjoying the game once I got into the swing of things.

However, this game does have two painful downsides that I had to mod the game to overcome, otherwise the game just felt like it was artificially stretching out its runtime - the checkpoint and fast travel systems. 

Whenever you would die, you'd respawn at a bench and you'd have to collect your soul to regain all your money. This is fine. However, the benches can sometimes be quite far from boss rooms. There are some bosses that are a three or four minute journey away from the nearest bench, meaning every time you die there's effectively a four minute loading screen after each attempt. This isn't engaging or anything, this is just painful. There is a mod that respawns you in the room you died, which fixed this issue for me by allowing me to jump straight back into boss fights.

The other issue, the fast travel system, is purely because there are so few fast travel points. The world in this game is huge, and each area has a fast travel point. If you've got an area you want to check out for one quick thing, that can sometimes take you upwards of 20 minutes to get there and back to where you came from. This game is full of backtracking and using your new abilities to find secrets in existing areas, so the lack of a variety of fast travel points really hurts this game. The bench warp mod fixed this for me and allowed me to get into the meat of the game much more consistently.

So while this game is a ton of fun when you're actually exploring or engaging in combat, the rough start and sluggish unmodded pacing definitely hurts the game a lot. Fixing the majority of those issues with mods, this game becomes an absolute joy to play.",True,1,1875
Hollow Knight,367520,209381923,"It's truly a fun game, the combat was not what I'm used to but quickly became a favourite of mine, and the story is really intriguing. It is a great exploratory adventure that's satisfying to play.",True,0,1214

Hollow Knight,367520,209379087,"Hollow Knight is a versatile and expansive experience that any avid gamer should have in their indie game utility belt, and fits a bunch of different preferences

In terms of the art style, the character design can be often adorable, whilst the environment sets a dark and gothic theme. The sound design, too, is impeccable, from the oddly satisfying shrieks of various bugs to the wonderfully cinematic soundtrack behind everything.

When it comes to story, it may not be the most obvious at first what's going on, but one of the joys in playing this game is uncovering the past of both the empty protagonist and the dead kingdom in which you explore. There are also many secrets to discover, often providing further story insight, or even entire subsections of the game. Every single friend and foe, location, and all in between comes with extensive lore built in.

Gameplay, while at times becoming frustrating in parkour and combat challenges, ultimately increases the psychological reward in being able to complete. Fair warning: each boss will take generally between a single try to up to ten or twenty attempts to defeat, so you'll have enough room to take in the importance of both being attentive to enemy move-sets and strategizing your own moves. Speaking of which, you will have ample upgrades to acquire throughout as essential parts of the progression. A perfect mix between the Metroidvania and Souls-like genres, if you ask me. All of the enemies have their quirks and each boss is entirely memorable in their glory or lack thereof. 

Also, when I say expansive, you can go from putting small scavenging bugs in their place in the start of the game to infiltrating dreams, completing a dark ritual for a sinister circus, and even slaying gods!

All within the cheap package of Hollow Knight, for your gaming needs.

Do i suggest it to people who love metroidvania games or to people who want to get into the genre? Definitely! This game has charm and beauty seeping through the seams. There also a SHIT tun of things to do that are completely  optional and aren't necessary in the slight way possible. For example [spoiler] doing all the bindings in the pantheons (boss rushes) [/spoiler]. I've spent 72 hours on steam alone and roughly another 70 hours on my xbox. This games has so much to it and i love it. its an almost perfect games but some of the areas when exploring are terrible. there either have really shit platforming design or really shit enemy design. For example [spoiler] queens garden [/spoiler] is a really annoying area to traverse through due to its annoying platforming that you have to go through and the annoying enemies that slow you down. it isn't too annoying of an area but its enough to make feel like im suffering. the same goes for [spoiler]the hive[/spoiler] . the only difference being that [spoiler] queens garden[/spoiler]  is visually stunning. speaking of visually stunning almost all areas are beautiful. the only ones that aren't are the ones that are designed to look gloomy or creepy (except from [spoiler] the hive[/spoiler]. that area is an actual ball ache to look at for me) . the areas use these beautiful colours that will give you an eyegasm. another thing that will make you eyes cum is the art style and the character designs its so good. everything is hand drawn to perfection and nothing ever feels out of place. and the character designs are a whole thing its self. every enemy is designed around the area its in and all of them fit together to make either beautiful or gloomy that fits the mood too well. and the lore of the game is whole different rabbit whole that i wont be going down and one i don't understand but you don't need to fully understand it all. you can try and piece it together yourself or watch a guide. personally i got some of the law from friends who had been playing before me and somehow ive made more progress than them and they've had the game longer than i have by literal months or years. thats how much i love this game. there are a total of 5 endings. which two are basically the same ending but changes slight visually and another two endings that are basically the same but the cut scene is a little longer basically showing off something. (may be lore related. i haven't got a fucking clue). another thing to talk about are the bosses. most of them are amazing. they either teach the player through the beginning of the game, give some challenge to the player but are still enjoyable or are so hard it makes you want to rip your teeth out. i love the majority of the bosses. most of them aren't that bad except for a few that are just more tedious rather than hard but the bosses are still one of the best things about the game. another one of the best things about the game is the soundtrack. its amazing. it fits the game so well and most of the songs you could easily fall asleep to and a few are actual bangers.

Intel i3, no GPU, 4–12GB RAM struggling for life.
I thought the game would lag harder than my future…
BUT NO.

It ran smooth like silk.
Even my laptop fans stopped screaming for once.

And the game itself… bro.

The atmosphere? Depressing but beautiful.

The music? Makes you emotional for no reason.

The bosses? Beat me like I owed them money.

The world? Full of secrets, pain, and charm.

The lore? Confusing at first, but addictive.

And Hornet?
Queen.
Just queen.

The game taught me patience, timing, and how to die in 0.3 seconds.

I swear no other game made me rage AND respect it at the same time.

✔ Exploring
✔ Fighting
✔ Deep story

Hollow Knight,367520,209272859,"Honestly I don't get why this game is overwhelmingly positive. Is it good? yes, but overwhelmingly? IMO no.

Half if not most of the game is running around trying to figure out what you're supposed to do, I don't find that fun. I would have preferred to have directions or a hint on where to go or something.
Yes exploring is fun, but not when you spend most of your time going over the areas you've already been, running around trying to find what the next objective is. Imagine GTA V but without mission markers. It gets boring and annoying having to google everything.

Later on you can buy markers to put on your map. Great! just mark where I've already been or where I want to come back, right? NOPE, you get a max of 6 markers (for each color) for whatever reason.

Ok I'll just remember where I've been, right? Well, what happens when I don't play for a few weeks then come back? already forgot everything.

Then during boss fights, or I guess in general, if you die, instead of respawning nearby, you respawn at the last bench you saved at. It's not fun and frustrating dying and then having to walk all the way back while taking damage along the way.

Then there's also the fact that, for whatever fucking reason, in order to see where you are on the map you need to sacrifice a slot which could be used for other upgrades. Same thing for automatically picking up dropped coins from monsters, like why aren't they just permanent upgrades?

I'll probably still finish the game, but I wanted to share my frustrating experience for a supposedly top rated game.",False,1,667

Between the fun bosses as well as exploration, I can say that out of the thirty hours I have sunk here, I have enjoyed a significant majority of them. That is not to say it is all sunshine and rainbows, as there are many sections that I found very annoying, especially runbacks on bosses. This is especially true for a few bosses such as WK and the bee guy. Furthermore, there is a complete change that occurs after a certain checkpoint that makes traversing one area extremely annoying.

Pros of Hollow Knight I loved the early/mid game and how mysterious the game feels to some one who has never played the game before and the nail combat plus the movement felt real nice to play with, and the challenge of the game did not feel bad at all to me I sure felt it with some bosses and areas but it never felt impossible. Cons of Hollow Knight I want to start this part if the review by saying I did beat the game and got skill but that aside I still feel like I want to point the cons of the game that I have with it. Con one for me will be the art style of the game I am not calling the art bad it just did not pop to me, con two the late game in a whole I did not like the late game of Hollow Knight and for me the late game of Hollow Knight to be after you have done all dreamers and for me I also explored the whole map and picked a fight with every boss I found but I still did not feel good fighting some of these bosses such as White-Defender, Lost Kin, and all dream bosses as a whole accept for Nightmare King Grimm witch to me is the best boss in the whole game and the best boss that team charry has ever made. (not I never beat all Pantheons I got to P3 and then felt satisfied enough with myself to move on to Silksong)   

 At the end of the day this game gave me a strong 4/10 I liked a lot of good aspects of the game but I feel to me the the cons I have outweigh the pros in my eyes.",False,2,5116

The lore, the enemy and character designs, the combat, the exploration, it felt magical...

Like the world, characters, music is just 10/10 but like the combat feels so clunky idk and the lack of options in it (nail+spells and that's it). I wish there was more options how to approach the fights, either with different weapons or mechanics other than pogo-ing (there is a ""parry"" system but the game doesnt tell you about it so you will not even know it until you see a vid on YouTube explaining it) this brings me to the biggest flaw of the whole game and that is Team Cherry doing weird and annoying gameplay choices. Infected crossroads being the biggest one. Why block parts of the map for no reason? Then theres a bit of a personal flaw i have and that is benchwarping. The amount of backtracking you have to do in this game is insane which isnt the problem, it is a metroidvania but having a good fast travel system should be in every single one. And Hollow Knight does it the worst. With the stag stations. I wish we got a ability to warp to the benches we rest at as in other metroidvanias like blasphemous. Also the main bosses are really fun but when you do the dlc bosses they are for some reason completely cracked on coke and you have almost no chance of reacting (unless you are a psychopath that has 10k hours in it).

I hate contact damage, the combat is built around melee attacks, so it just doesn't work with contact damage, I think it would be much better if the enemies did a block and if you walked through them then you'd take damage, I think that would make the nail arts actually usable.

But this popped up for 7 euros in the store and I was very bored.. but it turned out to be a great call! 

Fun game, I did start getting a bit lost early on so found a guide or two to get my bearings. 
I won't go through everything in detail but I just liked the overall look and feel of the game. 
It was fun, it was simple, it was great!  I might try the follow up at some point based on this game alone.

The only things I didn't enjoy were some of the more arbitrary challenges... like kill this same guy 5..10 etc times as he gets stronger. Like the white defender.. I think I fought him twice and then lost interest.

Sure, it’s not the easiest experience, especially for newcomers. But the idea is simple: if you keep dying in a certain area a hundred thousand times (and still are), chances are you’ve wandered in too early and need to level up - both your skills and your character.

Hollow Knight,367520,209103798,"I write as a busy person that just completed the main storyline after 30h. Hollow Knight was one of the most enjoyable and compelling single player experiences in a while. I usually avoid challenging single player games. Call them ""souls-like"" if you want. But Hollow Knight feels like a gate-way drug into the genre. Coming from more leaned back platformer experiences. 

What makes Hollow Knight compelling: a very simple game loop crafted to perfection. What initially looks like a tiny map due to your limited abilities, knowledge and skill opens up to become one of the most interconnected and challenging world filled with interesting ideas tied together by a mysterious story.
Everything is a bug that wants to hit you. But no scenario feels the same. The design potential has been explored to it's fullest! The art work is stunning, the music is immersive. And the boss fights are pure fun. You will die a lot, but every boss has learnable patterns that can be defeated with the right strategy and enough will-power.

But the true genius is how due to the metroidvania gatekeeping the devs managed to encourage backtracking, promoting intrinsically motivated navigation and exploration of new areas necessary to progress the story, without showing one quest marker the entire game. 

I am sitting at 63% completion and I am aiming for the 110% completion achievement: gonna squeeze every last bit of fun out of this masterpiece!

I did not fall in love with this game immediatelly like thousands of others did. I despise many aspects of the game. Most of all - exploration. The map is hard. I could not remember places I already visited. Halls look all the same. I felt like I was wandering around same places all the time, not knowing where to go next. In early game, death was very punishing and unmotivating.

I did no finish my first playthrough. Few months later, I came back and this time I decided to ditch exploration. I simply followed a guide on IGN and followed recommended path. I also installed VanillaMap mod and simply revealed whole map and items. Second mod I used was enemy HP bar. Now we are talking. Suddenly, I enjoyed everything, fights, progression, platforming.

And then comes the best part. Colloseums and Pantheons. I spent a quarter of the game only on these. For me, this was the best part. Fights and battles unlike anything else I have experienced. I have to tell, getting the last % of 112% in the fouth pantheon drove me crazy. But beating this felt the most rewarding in a long time.

Hollow Knight,367520,209077098,"'Recommended, BUT...' sort of deal.

Hollow Knight is a boss battler that identifies as a metroidvania. You play as THE Hollow Knight himself as you walk (eventually repeatedly dodge-dash) slowly through all sorts of dingy caverns, slashing away at all sorts of heinous invertebrate beasts with your toothpick. Normally i'd make a cheesy plot summary here but i'm not really sure if there was one since the dialogue requires an English Lit degree to decipher. Or, at least not playing after a long day.

As the game tries to be a Metroidvania (named for its expansive, maze-like map structure separated into 'areas', and backtrack focused design), 100% of what you'll be doing is exploring, slashing, and backtracking to gain an ability that allows you to overcome terrain obstacles and move to the next area. Eventually, you unlock an area focused around [spoiler] refighting bosses you've defeated [/spoiler], which is where i imagine the actual game takes place.

I'm just going to get the good stuff out of the way first. This game really excels in two areas: The boss battles, and the voice acting and sound direction, might just be the most masterful and memorable of any game i've ever played, and i don't say that lightly. The bosses in particular require close observation, patience, practice and skill. The visuals are fine, good even at points, for a 2D game.

Everything else, though, drags the game down far enough that i really want to mark this as a 'not recommended'. Despite everything i'm about to get into, i do feel that the game is just about too well made for that.

As a metroidvania, it's very [strike] hollow [/strike] barebones as many standards of the genre are absent. There are very few [spoiler] traversal upgrades [/spoiler] , and when you do get one, there are very few places to actually use it for anything. The map is small, movement is very slow, and [spoiler] this is not upgraded at any point [/spoiler] , so the world feels like an absolute slog to get through. There are no alternative weapon options [spoiler] and nail upgrades are limited to strength increases; they absolutely just leave you with your little toothpick the whole time [/spoiler]. You have basic directional projectiles and can heal but no other, interesting magic options. There's no equipment, alchemy, stat increases, stats [i] to [/i] increase, buffs, consumable items, or really any interesting or unique collectables. You pretty much end the game in the same state as you started it.

Some of these things are instead included in the 'charm' system. These give you bonuses or upgrades, but only a few can be equipped at a time, with each one having a different number of 'slots' it fills. This works really well for the bosses, as you can mix and match charms to create different builds to take in... but it singlehandedly kills the remaining 98% of the game as [spoiler] many of your upgrades, including those to movement, melee and ranged attacks, soul, all sorts that would be expected as just normal upgrades in any typical metroidvania to make traversal fun, or bearable in this case, are limited to only 2 or 3 at a time [/spoiler]. Even then there's still plenty that's missing.

If i've earned an upgrade that makes traversal bearable, why should i have to leave it off so i can keep using another upgrade that makes traversal bearable, when i could use both and make traversal fun, even? I think either the charms should've used an on/off system and the notch system saved for the boss rebattle modes, or [spoiler] a lot of the charms should've just been standard upgrades like these abilities/upgrades are in any other metroidvania [/spoiler] , and then bosses rebalanced around these. That would go a long way to improving the sense of growth and progression, and making the game feel a bit more fleshed out without any of those other metroidvania staples i mentioned. That's just what i think, anyway.

There are also a few other questionable decisions; My main one is how you can't reach full completion in one playthrough, or even by just taking your time and trying to enjoy the game. Not only because achievements include multiple instances of speedrunning, permadeath modes, and even one of a branching path near the end i think, but because there are some permanently missable things that count to full completion!! There's also the [spoiler] Colosseum of Fools, which is great and enjoyable, it's just that it's in an area which is supposed to be devoid of civilisation and it's full of excited spectators [/spoiler]. It's just a bit immersion breaking. [spoiler] I think it should've been closer to Dirtmouth, but not accessible until the same sort of time as usual. [/spoiler] As i mentioned before, the dialogue is also quite difficult to follow, which makes the plot, lore, worldbuilding, etc. a bit blurry. I had a few more nitpicks but i think i've made my point. I can't remember them right now so they can't be that important.

If you like replayability or boss battles and don't mind at least one 30+ hour slog, pick it up next time it's half off and you'll probably feel it's worth it. If you're a completionist, after a metroidvania, or like to move on after beating the final boss, definitely give this one a miss; you'll probably just end up annoyed or disappointed.",True,0,1981

Hollow Knight,367520,209060569,"Came back to leave a review after completing Silksong. I found Hollow Knight really hard to stick with and dropped it multiple times before finally finishing it prior to playing Silksong. 

My biggest complaint is that the storytelling is super vague and expects the player to pick up a big chunk of even the main storyline from environmental clues that aren't necessarily easy to make sense of. I can see how this method of storytelling appeals to people, but it's definitely not my cup of tea, and I struggled to maintain interest. I powered through the game and even after getting the ""true"" ending, still felt like I didn't really understand what is going on at all until I watched a video explaining everything which, looking back, I would never have been able to pick up myself.

Storytelling aside, the combat felt really one-dimensional. Having played Nine Sols before and Silksong after, I can't help but find Hollow Knight's combat system and boss fights lacking and boring, mostly relying on positioning and avoiding enemy attacks with a jump and a simple dash. While I understand that HK's combat is designed and balanced around enemies inflicting touch damage, I'm not a big fan of it, and found that bosses who rely on killing the player with them accidentally running into it are generally just less fun than bosses with more complex skill/movesets. And while Silksong has the same exact system, the combat just feels more fun and rewarding because of how fluid Hornet moves, and the addition of some movement abilities, with the biggest gamechanger being Clawline as a gap-closer or a way to deal with aerial enemies. I understand that Nine Sols has a completely different combat system and it's not fair to compare the combat of the two, but Nine Sols' parry-focused combat is perfect and just feels way way more rewarding than HK's and if you haven't played Nine Sols you should!

Hollow Knight,367520,209015606,"Before I start I would like to say that as of time of making this review that I am only 10 hours in.

this My boyfriend got me this game on sale after silk song got released and they were really excited for me to try it. I haven't ever played a metroidvena or whatever its called though I have played Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, Elden Ring, and Lies of P several times so I am familiar with Souls like. 
     What hurts me is that I cannot for the life of me see how/why this game is so praised as the ""end all be all"" of games. The world is and full of lore and has cute characters, though the levels feel like they go on forever and its the same enemies in each place just swapped out or just a reskin of a previous enemy. 
     The only boss fights I have encountered so far that I actually enjoyed were Hornet, The Soul Master and the Dung Defender. The reason why I liked those fights was because you get to have a 1v1 with a powerful character that doesn't feel like there is other outside bullshit trying to hit you, the reason why i like Dung Defender even though he throws random bullshit at you (literally) is because it only lasts for like...5 seconds? and they don't feel so hard to dodge.
     Characters like The Broken Vessel feel fine until you see that those orange fucks spawn in just to fuck with you piecing him up because he is honest to god, pretty easy. I am on my first play through and killed him first try even with having my soul container broken due to my shadow being elsewhere.
     Another character, The Watcher Knights. This is the boss where I had to put down my keyboard (yes, I use keyboard and mouse instead of a controller, I did the same to the previous games too) and turn off the game. The Watcher Knights suffer from being easy, though by lack of imagination have to add another one with unpredictable A.I. that roll at you at speeds of mach fuck. Now, you might be asking. [i] wait! didn't Dark Souls 3 have the Abyss Watchers? [/i] Well. The thing with the Abyss watchers is that, Yes. There are several bullshit factors that make the fight more difficult, though they are mitigated by the fact that other Abyss Watchers fight the main Boss in his second form, which gives you ample time to fight the weak one that is on your ass so you can beat up the actual boss...with The Watcher Knights it is clearly copy and paste. I haven't beaten them yet, so I am unsure if the boss fight gets better or worse. Though, Jesus Christ? 
     I was semi okay with the Mantis lords being like this due to the fact that they pretty much mimicked each other, sorta like pontiff sulyvahn from Dark Souls, though yet again the mantis lords can be summed up with ""Here is the first one, now do it again lmao but with another one of those bug bastards, get fucked buddy."" And they don't even have different designs or move sets? The Mantis Lords and The Watcher Knights, like I said, are copy and paste just to make the fight harder without having to actually design the bosses to be hard. There is so much lore to this world that I don't understand though I can feel around me, that was carefully put together. Though, when it comes to the boss fights in the mid game it just feels so lazy and actively makes me want to play other games.

     Honestly this can probably be summed up to ""skill issue"" which, I'll accept my fate to. Though I will not rate this game poorly because I have not finished it. When I finish this game I will make an edit at the bottom of this review to continue my thoughts, or to eat my words. I do hope that this game gets better, I actively want to like it and be a fan boy like my boyfriend though it is difficult trying to enjoy this game compared to other Souls likes I have. 

Edit: I have now 14 hours in the game and have completed it. 

I am glad that the mid game just had horrid bosses, though perhaps this game suffered from getting in too late and leaving too early. I liked the boss fight at the end, though it really feels like half of the bosses in this game just is really lazily done in my opinion. 
Like I said before, this was a gift from my boyfriend. I haven't hardly seen any gameplay of Hollow Knight until now since ive been playing it. My boyfriend and Others said that the boss fights were really a highlight in this game though after completing it I feel let down. Perhaps I was looking at this game to hard from the standpoint of a Souls-like enjoyer, maybe this game completes itself by being a good metroidvania? perhaps. this is the only metriodvania type game I have ever played so I have zero reference of what a good one is.

",False,0,52
Hollow Knight,367520,208983681,"The game does a wonderful job of keeping you entertained throughout the entire experience. The boss designs are awesome, with perfectly calculated attack patterns and styles. The animations, and everything else you can think of, are done perfectly.

I finished the game in 32 hours, though I have to admit the last few hours were a bit boring. This was because I saved all the grinding for the end and did all the fun parts first. As someone who gave up on the game across four different saves, believe me when I say: buy this game. Even if you finished a cracked version, go and buy it to support the developers.

I also want to mention that the game isn't as hard as streamers make it seem. Like I said, everything is calculated perfectly. The game doesn't throw impossible fights at you; instead, it gives you limited opportunities and lets you explore. It won't let you kill the final boss right away, but it lets you push your limits as much as you can.

For example, at the start of the game, you'll see a [spoiler]Grub.[/spoiler] There are three ways to reach it:

You can pogo off a fly in the room.

You can wait, return after you've obtained the [spoiler]Mantis Claw.[/spoiler]

You can wait even longer, after getting the Monarch Wings, to save the [spoiler]Grub.[/spoiler]

The game never forces you to play one way. This is a very simple example, but the game does this so well that you often feel like there are no limitations.

Also, since some streamers make the [spoiler]Path of Pain[/spoiler] look incredibly hard—it's not. It took me about 40-45 minutes to beat. For context, I sometimes struggle with basic platforming even with the [spoiler]Wings and Claw![/spoiler]

Hollow Knight,367520,208945365,"Precept Three: 'Always Be Rested'. Fighting and adventuring take their toll on your body. When you rest, your body strengthens and repairs itself. The longer you rest, the stronger you become.

Precept Four: 'Forget Your Past'. The past is painful, and thinking about your past can only bring you misery. Think about something else instead, such as the future, or some food.

Precept Twenty-Seven: 'Eat As Much As You Can'. When having a meal, eat as much as you possibly can. This gives you extra energy, and means you can eat less frequently.

Precept Thirty-Four: 'Don't Eat Immediately Before Sleeping'. This can cause restlessness and indigestion. It's just common sense.

Precept Thirty-Nine: 'Eat Quickly and Drink Slowly'. Your body is a delicate thing and you must fuel it with great deliberation. Food must go in as fast as possible, but fluids at a slower rate.

Precept Forty-Four: 'You Can Not Breathe Water'. Water is refreshing, but if you try to breathe it you are in for a nasty shock.

Precept Fifty-Five: 'Bow to No-one'. There are those in this world who would impose their will on others. They claim ownership over your food, your land, your body, and even your thoughts! They have done nothing to earn these things. Never bow to them, and make sure to disobey their commands.

The world contains a huge number of secrets and nuances e.g., entire locations could be hidden. Though I don't think some of them are fair or consistent. Usually there's something to give you a hint, but occasionally there are, like, floors/walls without any indications that there's something under/behind them. But I'd say at some point you will need to google anyway. I believe this is forgivable for this game since it is almost impossible to find all secrets by yourself.
- Quite interesting [b]lore[/b] and [b]atmosphere[/b].

[b]Cons[/b]:
- [b]Bosses[/b]. 80% of damage comes from contact damage when they make a sudden sidestep. 
[i]I don't think that's a good way to make a battle difficult[/i]. I would understand if bosses had a rich move set, but usually it's just 2-3 moves and the bosses rapidly move around the arena and damage you with their body. So the boss fights in most cases don't feel fun at all.
- [b]Flying/teleporting enemies[/b]. I cannot describe how I hate fighting them. It feels like you don't have enough means to confront them. They either constantly fly away from you and you have to catch up to try to get them or when trying to run by and ignore them, they simply overtake and contact damage you. Both behavior models are very annoying. The worst part is that there are quite a lot of them. To finish you off, when you hit them, you push them away, beginning the cycle again.
- [b]Tempo[/b]. The game slows you down a lot for some reason. You can't constantly keep going, there's always something that makes you wait. Especially when you need to go down with a lot of spikes on platforms or enemies and you need to constantly check if there is something below, and you're going to go down a lot. And if you get hit by a spike you get respawned unpredictably, so for the first a couple of seconds you spend to understand where you are. Elevators are personally painful with spikes on top, you can't simply jump down, so you have to call it first, wait, and then go down. There are also enemies designed to block your way or overtake you quickly to do so. At first it could be fun and you could spend a lot of time on each thing on your way, but eventually it becomes a routine and a pain in the ass.
- [b]Another boss attempt[/b]. Usually, you need to run one hell of a long way to make another try to kill a boss and with the environment forcefully slowing you down, it can be annoying e.g., [spoiler]the 2nd fight with Hornet[/spoiler], there's a long arena with nothing but a few ledges which don't let you use your flight so you have to just run there. And once you arrive there's often an unskippable animation before the fight and you have to watch them over and over. I've heard this is even worse in the sequel and I truly don't understand why it is supposed to be fun in any way.
- [b]General combat issues[/b]. It could be applied to all the points above. There're often situations when you don't know about enemies but they know about you. So they could attack you behind the screen. It is a regular situation and it is no fun. They could also just run away from you to where you can't see them and then contact damage you. So you often cannot play proactively meaning you have to wait, wait and wait for your enemies to do something before doing something yourself to be sure. Plus, many enemies like shooting homing projectiles going through walls that can get you by surprise and that feels very cheap.
- [b]Controls[/b]. They don't feel responsive sometimes, like there is no buffer for what you just pressed. Feels like there's a small delay after your input before you can input again. I often encountered situations where my inputs were just ignored without any visible reason why. I don't like it. I also had a problem with unintentionally triggered double jumps near corners or walls.

[b]Cons[/b] but debatable:
- [b]Abilities[/b]. I am sure some people may like it, but for me it was too slow and disappointing. What you get right away in most games, you have to slowly discover here, like double jumps, wall jumps, or a dash. Most games come with something interesting to stop you from going further, but here it is this simple. And often the game stops your progress with just a slightly bigger gap so you can't jump over it with your normal jump. It didn't feel rewarding for me, more like I was given back what I was supposed to have had to overcome something insignificant.",False,5,2780

Hollow Knight,367520,208901777,"Initially picking up this game in Oct. 2024, I spent about 45 hours slowly exploring and figuring things out myself, getting to 80 percent outside of the titular boss arena.

After a 10-month break, the initial plan was to finally look up online hints and guides to take care of some minor side quests and hidden rooms -- nothing serious or difficult. This got old quickly and I considered fighting the titular boss and ending the game. But then I had the thought: ""I wonder what that White Palace is like. Guess I'll have to fight the 'dream' bosses."" This was the literal game changer.

From there, I began looking up different charm builds and combat strategies, whereas previous I just compiled and did things haphazardly. After dispatching each of the dream bosses, it was the brutal punishing platforming of the White Palace. While in the White Palace, I once again had the thought, ""I wonder what the Path of Pain is like."" Twenty-plus hours* of frustration, cursing, wanting to quit, and literal pain, that, too was dispatched. But I wasn't done yet.

One thing turned into another: ""I wonder what the Colosseum of Fools is like""; ""I wonder what the Grimm Troupe DLC is like""; ""I wonder how to complete the Delicate Flower side quest,"" and so on. Each of these I completed, not efficiently, but I was locked in. When I thought I had finally beat the game by dispatching the titular boss, the Internet informed me after the fact of the real final boss: the Radiance. Even though I thought I was done, I just couldn't live with myself knowing the actual final boss hadn't been defeated. After some more hours of frustration, cursing, wanting to quit, and literal pain, the Radiance was finally defeated. This was last night.

At 108 percent and 108 hours**, as someone who went from almost ""calling it good"" to beating the Path of Pain, entire Colosseum of Fools, entire Grimm Troupe story line while beating Nightmare King Grimm in a wrist brace (thanks again, Path of Pain), attaining all the charms, masks, and shards, and beating the Radiance (again in a wrist brace), I am quite satisfied with my ""Hollow Knight"" experience. 

Recognizing my mental and physical limitations, I will regard the Pantheons with wonder and admiration. Major props to those who attempt these gauntlets, and major kudos to those who can beat them. As for me, I'll take my impulsive over-achievement and look forward to the next installment.

*Offline play not factored in to overall Steam runtime (don't like my Internet on while sleeping).

The difficulty does ramp up later, and the DLCs and endgame are definitely tough, which can be demotivating for some players. I have had moments where I just wanted to quit, but the lore, story, and sheer depth of the game kept me going. The multiple endings were a great bonus too, and it all felt worth it in the end.

And the more i explored the more i liked it. 

Now hollow knight still isnt a game I would usually play, Im not a very big fan of metroidvania souls likes. But after getting a few endings and seeing about 85% of the game at the time of writing, I can see why its praised and prized by its fans.

Hollow Knight,367520,208853547,"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

If you want a game that makes you feel things. ranging from being amazed, to being lost, and bashing your head against the wall, then, this is the one.

On a serious note, everything about this game is just great. Music? Phenomenal. Atmosphere? Likewise. Story? Tear shedding. Art style? Just perfect.

Almost every boss is fair and makes you think that it was your fault for losing. The bosses are fun, challenging, and rewarding.

Even if you beat the game normally, there are many more things you can do. There are many endings to get, story to uncover, charms to collect, quests to finish, and, of course, fight the freaking sun.

I can't believe this work of art was made by 3 people, major companies could never.

Along with the combat, as it gets more complex over the course of the story.

The bosses aren't too difficult and only take time to learn how they play and move, and once you figure that out it gets easy and potentially even enjoyable to finally defeat that one boss that you always struggled on.

I’m not really into platformers and I can only do about 11 deaths in a row with any souls like before I consider throwing my steam deck against a wall but hollow knight isn’t built like any game. It’s so simple and engaging with just the right level of challenge to make me constantly try new approaches and techniques. 

It’s the perfect game to pick up and play for a bit in between work as well as compelling enough that I come back thinking of new ways to beat bosses and explore the game world. 

On top of the brilliant base game turns out TC have been releasing free content for years!

Hollow Knight,367520,208809413,"Hollow Knight is one of the finest 2D platformers ever made. Combat feels smooth and satisfying, with each boss battle testing your patience and precision. The normal bosses are well-balanced and easier to read, while the Dream bosses push your reflexes to the limit, offering thrilling and challenging fights.

Exploration is the heart of the game — from the eerie depths of the Forgotten Crossroads to the regal heights of the White Palace, every location feels alive and mysterious. There’s no right or wrong path — just explore, and you’ll constantly discover new secrets, shortcuts, and surprises.

Geo farming feels natural rather than grindy, as enemies, colosseum battles, and exploration all reward you consistently. Charms and spell upgrades add meaningful customization, and spells themselves can devastate mini-bosses with the right build. The Path of Pain stands as the ultimate platforming challenge for those who crave mastery.

With a beautiful soundtrack, emotional NPC stories, and smooth traversal upgrades, Hollow Knight never stops rewarding your curiosity. Even after 100+ hours for full 112% completion, it remains satisfying from start to finish. For its low price (around $4 on sale), the sheer content, polish, and atmosphere make it a must-play.

Team Cherry created not just a game, but an experience that defines what a perfect Metroidvania should be. Looking forward to diving into your second masterpiece, Silksong, soon.

But I loved this game so much that when I got it on Steam, I had no disappointment replaying the game from square zero (I loved it). Combined with this game's well-thought out narrative, stunning soundtrack and beautiful art, the game play spans around 30 hours of fun in the core narrative and a whole 80 or so for players who want to take it further (like me). I have about 200 hours on this game at time of review (about 120 on my PS4) and I still have some extra hard challenges I can do. 

This is a must-play for almost everyone (it's also only 15 USD).",True,0,3861

Hollow Knight,367520,208728897,"I don't care what anyone says, the map design in this game is atrocious and the amount of backtracking is simply mindblowing, the game deserves a downvote just based on that. 

I don't generally mind a bit of backtracking and I can appreciate non-linear games, but here we only get an illusion of non-linearity since there is only one actual path that you need to take to progress further, you just don't know it until you find it. This leads you to taking the wrong turns constantly as you try to find the one and only path, which means endlessly reclearing the same corridors. Now, this wouldn't be that bad if there was a good mini-map, markers or landmarks that would help you get your bearings, but no - there is nothing of the sort, instead you get various shades of gray as you traverse the Same Corridor #69420 for the 10th time. It also wouldn't be that bad if going off the only and only path was rewarding in ANY way, but in 99% of cases you will get nothing or a few geos.

All that directly links with the second point that is constant backtracking, which can be somewhat limited if you already KNOW when and where you'll get a certain feature that you'll need to unlock certain doors or collect certain items, but when you're playing for the first time? Yeah, have fun (you won't).",False,2,1196

It is soul-like so it can be challenging at times but it makes you want more. Can you make it easier? Yes (mods) can you make harder? (yes mods). Yes there are mods for the PC version of this game if i didnt made it clear enough.
Lets clarify that i just finished my second play-thru before getting to Silksong and I can say for sure that this is my comfort game.

Hollow Knight,367520,208665978,"It's a great game with amazing visuals. The first 80% is generally fantastic, with very few stinkers in between the bosses. The lategame though? No thanks. Bosses spam attacks, there's a bunch of crap flying around and there are no clear gaps in their attacks which can be exploited without taking damage. If you don't mind spending 10 hours learning unfair bossfights to actually progress the story, go ahead. It's not for me. The last good fight I fought was the hollow knight, completing the normal game. For the last 32% with alternative endings, it's just not worth it. It's a grind, it's a slog, it's boring, it's annoying and it just feels like they ran out of ideas and compensate for this with more projectiles and bigger hitboxes that effectively make pogo and dash not viable. In this sense I guess I was hoping it was more like Blasphemous lategame. Extremely difficult, but mostly fair and skill based. I hope silksong is better.

Still, amazing value for money. I just don't want to spend days training muscle memory to fight a boss. It's no longer a skill issue at that point, you're learning all the attack patterns to pixel perfection because that's the only way to win. Either that or give up and spam spells.

Hollow Knight,367520,208647615,"Hollow Knight is a precision-focused Metroidvania set in the ruined insect kingdom of Hallownest. Exploration drives the entire structure. The map unfolds through deliberate navigation, hidden paths, and gradual acquisition of movement abilities. The pacing is controlled and rewards careful observation.

Combat is simple but demanding. The nail provides short-range attacks with tight timing windows. Enemies telegraph patterns clearly, so success depends on spacing and discipline. Boss fights escalate this design. They test pattern recognition and consistent execution rather than stat-based power.

Progression relies on ability upgrades and charm loadouts. Abilities unlock new regions, while charms modify combat, mobility, or survivability. The system allows meaningful customization without excess complexity. Builds remain readable and grounded.

The world is delivered through environmental storytelling. NPCs appear sparingly and provide limited guidance. Most narrative context comes from ruins, encounters, and implied history. This creates a quiet tone and a sense of discovery without direct exposition.

Art direction is hand-drawn and sharp. Regions differ in color, architecture, and enemy behavior. Animations are clean and readable, which matters for precise combat. Visual contrast ensures threats remain identifiable even in dense areas.

Audio design defines atmosphere. The soundtrack uses subdued piano, strings, and ambient layers. Sound cues mark enemy actions and hazards with clarity. The mix preserves informational signals during high-intensity fights.

Hollow Knight succeeds through tight controls, disciplined world design, and restrained storytelling. It offers long exploration, high mechanical challenge, and strong environmental identity.

Gorgeous. 
So simple yet so alive in every aspect. The movement feels natural. The enemies feel like they belong where they are. The combat is very challenging, but rewarding all the same. The story is dark and nuanced with hints being left all over filling in blanks, but also raising more questions. Every mechanic is meticulously crafted and balances itself. The limited upgrades work well with having to equip different charms as to fit different scenarios, bosses, or other situations.

When I first started playing I was absolutely horrible at everything I tried to do, I haven’t played neither metroidvanias nor many platformers before attempting to play this game and it surely was visible in how I attempted everything…
So I took a break from it, a rather long one at that, and I came back after playing some simpler games of the sort aaaand the comeback was much more pleasant than the first attempt. I still wasn’t too good at it, but slightly less frustrated about that fact, so I tried again and again, slowly watching myself getting a better grasp of the mechanics.

The dark atmosphere is top notch, and so are the boss designs. It's tough and punishing, but it felt much more fair than a lot of its more recent copycats.

Nightmare Grimm aside, beating a difficult boss was usually a matter of taking some time to calm down and find my focus. Attacks are mostly well-signaled, and getting through them is a matter of not making (too many) mistakes.

Bosses also didn't feel as damage-spongy as a lot of what Metroid Dread had on offer.

Im glad I didnt pay for this game because id be really mad at myself. This game seems to have been designed with a literal disdain for anyone who dared waste $20 on it. The ""fast travel"" system is a joke. You spend more time trying to get back to where you thought you should have been going than you do actually playing the fucking game. I think my favorite part is the input lag in a game that requires really precise timing on certain things. Without mods I would have put this game down after about 5 hours. Being forced to spend a notch point on a compass or picking up currency might be one of the most braindead things in this game besides the fact that you cant just simply teleport between save benches.

There's [i]very[/i] few movement unlocks, and tragically little to discover outside of currency for such a large map. The map also unfolds incredibly linearly for the first 75% of the game which is not ideal.

Hollow Knight,367520,208589161,"Hollow Knight is, simply put, a masterpiece. I've played many games before in my (albeit relatively short) life, and this one seems to top them all. At first, I was hesitant to purchase the game due to my unfamiliarity with the metroidvania genre, but the release of Silksong drove me to give it a shot, and I can now confidently say it was worth it.

As one of the few cracks in this otherwise lustrous, perfect gemstone, the game's slow beginning is a small hurdle to overcome prior to enjoying the experience to its full extent; if you're looking to purchase this work, please keep such information in mind. It is undeniable, however, that once in its clutches, Hollow Knight will not let go of your attention with its addictive gameplay loop, intriguing exploration, and thrilling boss fights.

Aditionally, it's worth mentioning that the game has no intent in protecting the player from the consequences of their own actions: misplays will absolutely be met with proportional setback, but the realistic nature of this dynamic makes it all the more satisfying to best Hallownest's challenges. By no means is this a negative point, as long as you remain open-minded and conscient of your own faults.

I'm having a blast playing it right now. At first I just want to play it, rush it and get to Silksong but it looks like I'm going to pour hundreds of hours to this game and try to 100% it. This has to be one of the best games I've ever played. Thank goodness I bought a Legion Go S and decided to play this game. I'm only 17 hours in but it felt like I was playing it longer than that.

If you're hesitating to buy this game, don't. Just get it. This is the best 10 bucks you'll ever spent in your life! It will start of slow but once you kill a boss or two, you'll get addicted. Even the backtracking doesn't feel like a chore. You'll wanna back track and explore some moreeeee. Just beware of a fking flying mosquito with an an orange butt. Those guys are annoying af. I'm excited playing Silksong but I will take my sweet time playing this game first.

Spawn points are here and there, so you're not walking so far if you die and have to collect your sole before you die again and lose all your money.  However, the huge problem I have, is there's NOTHING to tell you where you should be going or what items and such you should have and\or have enabled.  I wish I would have known this before I bought it.  I've been trying to work my way through with guides and such, but it's just a pain in the ass, and I'm getting bored quickly with it.  The mapping system is basic, and only when you find the maps for all the regions as you slowly progress.  You'll find yourself constantly trying to get money, cause everything cost money, even just to mark stuff on the map.

Hollow Knight,367520,208572675,"[h1] Preface [/h1]
I took 3 attempts to finally get into the groove with this game. I gave up the first 2 times because I'm not about that metroidvania life - I'd keep roaming around the same 5 places with dead-ends till I go insane, completely clueless about where to go next to unlock the upgrades I need to get past the said dead-ends.

One day I came across a friend on discord who was playing this with a guide - my initial instinct was ""isn't that cheating? lol"" but his very pragmatic response was simply ""No. Guides in these metroidvanias proxy as the where-to-go-next markers you see in most other games."" - like an overhead pointer or a marker on the mini map. I realized that using a guide effectively renders HK a part puzzle-platformer + a series of almost soulslike boss fights. Which I can get behind.

[h1] Appreciation [/h1]
I am glad I stumbled upon that VC that fateful day. Now, after having nearly completed this game with IGN's guide on a second screen, I can safely say that this game has [i]by far the most value for money[/i] in a video game I have ever experienced (lightyears far, seriously), nothing even comes close. It is my new favourite game. (Dethroning Arkham Asylum took some beating - it holds a special place in my heart due to fond childhood memories.)

If I knew what I was getting into, I'd have happily paid $60 for the pleasure to wield a nail in this absolutely gorgeous, vast and diverse masterpiece. 

[h1] More on value for money [/h1]
Now that I know what this game is really like, I almost feel guilty for purchasing it on sale. Now I would deliberately wait for a sale to be over to purchase Silksong - I'm beyond certain that that game is also worth more than some EA titles combined.

It is also criminal that [i]they made all DLCs free[/i]. God bless this one studio working wonders while charging 1/3rd of what this game is [i]at least[/i] worth.

Most AAA titles - not just the slop, even the critically acclaimed ones - AND revered indie titles these days cost $30-70 (more for expansions) and sometimes don't last beyond 6 hours, though the average period in my experience tends to be around 12-18 hours for only the single player campaign (excluding side missions, etc). There are some rare standouts that take longer (The WItcher 3, RDR2, Elden Ring, etc.) but even they - indie or AAA - cost $60-70 at full price. This game flies in that face of the whole industry with the value it provides for a modest $15.

What's even more impressive is that the titles I've listed above are critically acclaimed, deeply-cherished-by-the-community ones. Most AAA games these days don't last beyond 16 hrs, nor do they house any real quality. Hollow Knight is so vast, deep, and high-quality - EA would've milked 3-4 games out of this package for $60 each if they were to develop this concept.

The sheer vastness cannot be articulated - you just have to experience it. It'll hit you when, after having explored the first few sections of the map, you venture deeper into hallownest and return to the initial sections at some point. It made my jaw drop with wonder when I reflected ""this is all the same game. These sections are not from a prequel, it's all one game I bought for $4.""",True,2,2322
Hollow Knight,367520,208572299,"While I'm not over the moon for this game like most people, I can't really justify giving it the thumbs down either. It's a very playable, pretty fun platformer that has a few flaws that bother me. The graphics are very nice and uniquely Hollow Knight, you won't find another game that looks like it other than its sequel. While the music is iconic and for good reason, I have to knock the sound design a little bit. The game has sound cues for literally everything around you, which gets overwhelming in certain rooms where there are many sound effects all playing over each other at full volume constantly. That may seem like a small issue, but it really takes you out of the game in some areas.

As for the gameplay itself, it's pretty great. The controls are responsive and fluid, with the only trouble I had being with the wall jump not sticking to walls sometimes. None of the movement upgrades you get will blow your mind or anything, but they complement each other very well. When you have your full moveset, going around the more obstacle-heavy rooms really fast certainly makes you feel like a god gamer. The combat is a little bit more limited, though. Aside from a few special attacks you can unlock through the course of the game, the only attacks you're usually left with are your main weapon and a limited use projectile. Thankfully, most of the boss fights are designed with this in mind, giving you ample opportunity to attack. Being able to stagger bosses to give you precious time you can use to use your healing ability, which is slow and leaves you vulnerable, is incredibly smart from a game design standpoint. This game isn't nearly as difficult as it's sometimes described as, at least not if you simply wanna get to the end, and that works in the game's favour in my opinion.

What would've worked better though, is if they ditched the more punishing gameplay elements. Having a very limited healthbar where you need to make space for yourself to recover it is fine, it adds a a little bit more pressure onto the player. Losing all of your money on death and having to chase it down afterwards just does not work in a game like this, though. It's very frustrating if you end up in an area you're not quite ready for yet, die, and have to trudge through there again just to recover all the stuff you've lost. Because the game is all about the exploration aspect, and because you're given very little guidance on where to go next, it's pretty inevitable that this will happen to you at least once on a first playthrough. Traversal also takes longer to get from one end of the map to the other than most games, fast travel is very limited, and certain paths get blocked off over time, which makes the later parts of the game pretty tedious when you have to go around nearly the entire map just to unlock the final boss.

Overall, it's a pretty good game despite my problems with it. I couldn't really find myself caring that much for the lore or anything, there are games in this genre that do it better in my opinion, but I like seeing the memes of it on the social medias so it's all good.",True,0,569

I can see why Silksong was so anticipated for so long. If I didn't already know there was a sequel, I'd be upset after finishing this game to have nothing left.

This might be one of the only games I've ever played where I genuinely cannot think of a single thing I do not like about it. The combat is great, the music is great, the exploration is super fun, the different areas/biomes are really well designed and all the music for each one complements it perfectly, the character designs are all super cute and funny, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is interesting but not obtrusive, the movement is really satisfying especially as you unlock more abilities, did I mention I like the music in this game? I guess at times it can be a little annoying to run back to a particular boss after dying especially when you die multiple times but that just makes it even more satisfying to finally beat them or when you unlock [spoiler] the Godhome and can fight each boss without fear of dying at all[/spoiler].

Hollow Knight,367520,208534257,"Hollow Knight is such an oddball game to me in the sense that it's an incredible experience when the devs actually design it to challenge you but most of the game is painfully boring.

The spirit mechanic on paper is fine as a conventional meter system but I think the healing mechanic hurts it. I don't like the fact that it allows wreckless play because most enemies aren't actually capable of doing more than one piece of damage to you before they die and the amount of meter you build by attacking them alleviates it quickly. The few enemies that do are usually slow moving big bodies that either can be trivalized with an attack + dash away tactic or you can safely dash over their heads. This wouldn't be so bad if wasn't for the fact that in the moment to moment, enemies don't typically control much space or pose any threat to you through attrition in a way they can in other metroidvanias. It's way too easy to just ignore them 80% of the time. There's also the issue that since healing takes up the spirit meter you're typically discouraged from using any other ability that utilizes that system since the reward and cost of using any ability isn't worth it when keeping yourself alive is far more rewarding. It gets worse with the weird tuning where nail upgrades make bosses have more health which makes your abilities weaker.

The level design is a mix of mostly empty hallways with pits and areas that emphasize verticality. Enemy layouts are cookie cutter, usually 3-4 fodder enemies in a hallway or a few easily ignorable flying enemies in more vertical areas. On the rare occassion you may get an enemy that's good at covering space such as the Soul Twister's but the game rarely feels the need to make enemy encounters threatening. This is probably to make the travel between areas less tedious given how limited the fast travel mechanic is but it still feels like a chore especially with how much gating the game has. This may be a necessity given the scale of the game but it just results in a lot of boring back and forth between areas where you'll often end up ignoring enemies after a certain point.

Aside from this Hollow Knight does offer the occassional platforming setpiece. These are easily more interesting than most of the moment to moment in Hollow Knight but I feel their main issue is that they're usually overly reliant on one ability and are too easily solved. Even still, I'd much prefer this than the norm with Hollow Knight because it's at least making use of certian mechanics. These setpieces are too sparse and usually optional.

The way Hollow Knight presents its map system is pretty unique but I wish they'd commit to it. Very early you get upgrades to transform it into a conventional metroidvania map system when the initial premise is you have no map marker and had to read the layouts yourself. On some level I feel this would have been received poorly by a lot of players and you could make the case that it just adds drudgery to a simple concept, but it just comes off as cowardly to not make this the default experience. The caveat they make for this is not severe enough to matter and in any situation where you might not want the pin for tracking your part of the map is within areas that likely will have a seat for you to change it anyway. 

Hollow Knight's progression is slower than most metroidvanias and that's to its detriment. The game has a lot of bosses but most function under the assumption you only have the dash ability and thus it's a slog to play through because these boss fights are so boring and one note. Too many bosses are overly generous in terms of how big their start up frames are for their attacks and arenas are usually fairly sizable to make dodging them easy. Usually the way bosses are designed in that they focus on one or two attacks and after being hit a number of times they do the attack another time sequentially and I find this boring because you're never changing your solution when engaging with these different phases. What worked the first time is going to work again the second time. It's not until [spoiler]Hollow Knight[/spoiler] where the game's boss fights finally acknowledges that you have more mobility options than just the dash and god I wish the game did this sooner.

Nothing about the plot or lore grabbed me. A lot of it is excessively cryptic and the game doesn't really give you much reason to care or ponder what any specific message means. I guess there's some lore heads who like piecing it together but with the bits I decided to invest in it all came off to me as so tepid and uninspired. The crypticness has a purpose in defining its overall vibe but the game didn't sell me enough on its vibe for me to care.

I completed the game within 20 hours and I was under the impression that the post-game wasn't inviting anything valuable to engage with. But my peers insisted I try it out and well... I gotta it admit it changed my perspective of the game.

The Trial of fools is a damn solid gauntlet that actually had me thinking about the utility of my arts and it's also a case where the specific point you decide to do it changes the experience. Not having the shade cloak; for example, has you thinking about enemies in a very different way. I also love that it tightens the space for certain enemies, making you far more thoughtful about your movement options. It can be a bit tiring to go through multiple attempts given that you might be only filtered by one part of the gauntlet and the rest of it ends up feeling tedious but I respect the game demanding that level of consistency from you.

The White Palace convinced me that Hollow Knight has merit as a platformer. This is the only case where I felt the game was making me utilize multiple different mechanics and also allowing for ways to approach challenges in unorthodox ways. I think what I like about it too is how it shows the flexibility of the dash button given that it's useful for both platforming and combat. Combining that with the double jump is such a satisfying way to get over obstacles. It was so cool seeing the boost ability be utilized here in the way it was as well, given that the main game only really uses it for gating. My only problem with this section is that there are some areas where it obscures sight of a saw hazard and you could get damaged due to lacking the knowledge that it exists in that area. But other than that, a surprisingly well-designed platform level.

The post-game/optional boss fights are so bizarre to me in the sense that they feel alien to how bosses are usually designed in the main game. They're a lot more varied in the type of attacks they use and they'll also utilize multiple attacks at once to cover space. [spoiler]The Radiance[/spoiler] is such a great example of this. But others like Lost Kin use spawning enemies to add challenge too, which they clearly didn't have the balls to do in the main game. I gotta say, when I started the Godhome boss gauntlet it highlighted to me how boring most of the game's bosses are and it made me lose all enthusiasm for doing it.

So it begs the question, why did I put this in ""not recommended?"" On a certain level, I think Hollow Knight is fantastic. But it's also a case where like... only 10% of the game is actually engaging to me, which is more egregious in how a lot of it is DLC. The game's highs are incredible, but I don't even think the game has lows. It's just consistently boring for most of its playtime. The game has such a strong foundation yet Team Cherry rarely feels compelled to push it, and that's what makes Hollow Knight so disappointing to me.",False,7,2083

I'm into a few rogue-likes/lites, Undertale, and some Nintendo games. When Silksong released and the hype was crazy, I decided to buy Hollow Knight.

I don't think I could have bought a better game with that money.

At first, I thought that it was weird to have an open world sidescroller game, but they actually did a great job making an open world. So far the progression seems very well-paced. I am never bored playing it and I feel like I am unlocking new items at a great pace. The bosses are difficult enough that I'm not breezing through them, but they're not so difficult that I'm getting discouraged (I know, I'm just at the start. I'm aware that I'm fighting the easy bosses). Overall, I would rate the game 9.5/10 because I can't kill that annoying Zote the Mighty guy. If I can kill him later on, I will change my rating to 10/10

[h2]Art & Atmosphere: The Beauty of Desolation[/h2]
Hollow Knight is not just drawn—it’s crafted. Every frame, every wall, every faint glimmer of light in Hallownest feels deliberate, as if painted by a melancholy artist who understands both wonder and grief. Its hand-drawn world breathes with sorrowful elegance, a haunting beauty that lingers in every corridor. Each region—whether the forgotten city bathed in rain or the fungal caverns pulsing with quiet life—has its own soul, its own story to whisper if you’re willing to listen.

[h2]World Design: A Maze of Meaning[/h2]
The kingdom of Hallownest is vast, layered, and intricately interwoven. Paths fold into each other with masterful precision, creating a world that feels alive, ancient, and waiting. Every shortcut unlocked, every hidden chamber found feels earned—a testament to your perseverance and curiosity. Exploration here is not just a mechanic; it’s a pilgrimage.

[h2]Gameplay & Combat: Precision in Motion[/h2]
Hollow Knight’s combat is pure rhythm—graceful, sharp, and exacting. Every strike, every dodge, every leap carries weight. It’s not about raw strength, but mastery through understanding. As your abilities grow, so too does your freedom, until movement itself becomes an art form. There’s poetry in its precision, beauty in its balance. The bosses, too, are lessons in patience and observation: merciless yet fair, demanding respect but offering triumph to those who endure.

[h2]Story & Music: Whispers Beneath the Earth[/h2]
The story is never handed to you—it’s found, hidden in the ruins, in forgotten words, in fading memories. Hollow Knight trusts you to piece it together, to see meaning in the silence. The music, composed with haunting restraint, becomes your companion—a blend of sorrow and serenity that deepens every emotion without a single word spoken.

[h2]Pacing & Patience: The Weight of the Beginning[/h2]
The early hours move slowly, restrained by the limitations of your fragile form. Yet, in that restraint lies purpose. It teaches humility. It asks you to earn your strength, to savor each new ability as liberation. The journey begins with struggle, but ends in transcendence.

[h2]Final Verdict: A Timeless Descent into Beauty[/h2]
Hollow Knight is not merely a game—it’s a meditation on persistence, loss, and discovery. It rewards curiosity, punishes arrogance, and quietly teaches resilience. Few games manage to speak so loudly through silence, to build a world so broken yet so full of grace.

Team Cherry didn’t just make a platformer; they built a world that feels remembered.
A place you don’t simply play—you inhabit, you endure, you fall in love with.

Hollow Knight,367520,208510579,"There are three things I got from buying many Nintendo consoles over the years to play Pokemon games. One - fun from playing Pokemon games, two - zeroing my savings account, three - my love of Metroidvania genre as Metroid and Castlevania were the only worthwhile things beside Pokemon I could play on those consoles.

Hollow Knight is a good game, a monument to indie games and a middle finger to tripple A segment but not exactly best Metroidvania.

Music and sounds are very good and fitting, I have many tracks from it playing frequently in my favorite playlists.

Art design is conceptually unique and flawless aside from colors. 80% of the game is the same, constant mud stain of grey and blue with squint of white and black in it. Some would say it's fitting to the overall game atmosphere and they're not wrong. After all calling it Dark Souls of Metroidvanias or Dark Souls 2D has to come from somewhere.
Sadly unlike Dark Souls and for instance Ender Lillies I found it really boring and tedious after a while. I ended up happy every time I discovered new or revisited one of the more vivid areas like Green Path or Fungal Wastes.

Story is solid but quite fractured. Similar to Souls series by just playing you learn enough to have a general idea with much being unknown,few scraps available via characters dialog, items descriptions etc. and a lot left for speculation. This kind of makes learning the lore a reward and mechanic on itself.

Gameplay wise devs did not invent the wheel anew here, like in every metroidvania you have familiar style map for you to explore and set of abilities like double jump, wall climbing etc. and bosses to kill. What is different is ""pogo"" tying directly to combat system. 
If you hit an enemy or spike on wall or floor (at least specific type of spike) you get backed off a bit. That allows you to ""pogo"" yourself through some areas and makes combat more vertical and engaging.

Default difficulty curve if well designed. Don't skip of exploration, getting new skills and upgrades more or less in dev intended way and you'll be fine. At least till the end or till you touch optional bosses. You can always use the equip able charm system to customize your character more closely to the way you like to play which is a nice addition.

Hollow Knight's main two problems are mentioned above ""dev intended way"" which is hard to identify and somewhat iffy map design. 

Starting with the latter there are three separate systems of fast travel independent of each other. Despite that they're are spread way to thin and scarce making huge portions of the map accessible only through long and tedious backtracking by foot. Benches aka resting spots are fourth, completely separate deal. They're also too few for my liking but would make the game way better if you could just teleport between them instead of additional methods of fast travel.

Now what usually happens when I play new metroidvania game is I'm able to finish it checking the wiki or yt guide if I'm stuck which happens two maybe three times at most. Then I start a new game plus trying achieve 100%, 112% 200% or whatever given tittle offers by freely using wiki and guides.

In Hollow Knight however I had to more than quadruple said first time wiki/yt counter due to the sheer amount to times I was stuck with my head against the wall unable to progress and not knowing what to do or where I'm suppose to go next. That's the most subjective and final part of my review but in my ... well ... opinion something is wrong here.",True,0,2180

Před léty jsem jej koupil ve slevě na Vánoce. HK byl všude oslavován, tak jsem si řekl, proč to taky nezkusit? 

Na poprvé jsem to zabalil asi po hodině, neměl jsem chuť se o Vánocích babrat s titulem, který je extrémně těžký a dost depresivní, tak šel HK rychle z disku.

Pár let dopředu, dozrál ten správný čas zkusit HK znovu. A jelikož trpím těžkou nemocí, která mě nutí prolézat každý kout a nic neopomenout, šáhl jsem po návodu. Prolézal celým světem s otevřeným tabletem před sebou a kopíroval každý krok z ""112% Completion Guide"". No jasně, byla to nuda a po asi 6 hodinách jsem HK poslal nadobro k ledu. Už nikdy více!

No a pak vyšel Silksong a já se svezl na vlně hypu, dal Hollow Knightu třetí šanci a konečně to všechno do sebe zapadlo a já prozkoumával, vracel se, bojoval, skákal, zase se vracel a trhal vlasy a propadal euforii u bossů. Až jsem dnes po 23 hodinách zdolal finálního bosse, samotného Hollow Knighta! A byla to velká jízda! Jsem rád, že se na hype train naskočil a konečně pokořil tuhle skvělou hru!

Klady:
+ Grafika
+ Level design (metroidvanie jak se patří)
+ Boje a bossové (Mantis Lords jsem dal na poprvé!)
+ Hudba a zvuky
+ Charmy
+ Reaktivní a přesné ovládání

- Na mě celkem těžké, ale to je jen moje osobní mínus :-)

Hollow Knight jsem si užil, hodně jsem si ho užil a zamiloval se do celého melancholického broučího světa. Časem určitě vyzkouším i Silksong, ač si myslím, že obtížnost už na mě bude příliš vysoká.

A ještě poslední poznámka.. Hollow Knight je skvělý, ale moje srdce patří stále Ori: WotW. Víc než boj si užívám platforming, takže Ori zůstal pro mě nepokořen.

This masterpiece reminds you, right at the beginning of the game, how bad you are at orientation, cause let's be honest, everyone got lost in Hallownest at their first playthrough :D. However, when you are patient enough and keep playing, you will discover a whole new small universe in the gaming world, and the hidden, magnificent gem among indie games. If you are a Soulslike enthusiast, you also won’t regret it, because bosses are hard, yet balanced, and extremely rewarding in the end. Although bosses are tough, you will love fighting them, and the feeling of finishing the boss for the first time is irreplaceable. I must highlight creativity in making the locations, creatures, bosses, and story, which punctuate the game experience even more.

But at any cost, do not play if you're very easily stressed out and have anger issues. Effects include: wanting to fire 10 countries, eat 5 homeless people and 3 kids, get your computer destroyed as hell. Play with caution, nobody on your side to do anything in case you feel like firing them because they r distracting.

The beginning is definetely rather boring than stressing. You have to search a couple things up which makes it even more annoying. You take around 30-35 hrs for a first-time ending the game, so up to ya spending it. But it kinda feels fun to actually beat the bosses. Idk what makes it fun, maybe because next time you can win it easily, but idk really, its just fun!

Hollow Knight,367520,208485445,"Im not going to lie, the early game in hollow knight is... ambivalent. It can be very vague and a bit guide dependant (I had to use one for greenpath) however, I can't say much that is bad about the rest of the game, the story is great and the bosses are quite good (although some do lack many attacks and are gimmicky) the skill ceiling is extremely high and there are lots of challenges once you get good and after the first section of the game exploring is great and mostly obvious (if your looking). The aftergame content is also huge and great for achievement hunters, it actually requires skill unlike the dreaded staircase in DS3... I will say I do get input issues on this game though even with only my controller plugged in, however it is minor and only really affects top tier play (such as against the final and aftergame bosses)",True,0,6553

I really can't find any good complaints about it other than that your shade can be in a few awkward places and that the starting area is a bit grey/
Hollow knight also does one more thing amazingly:
It introduces mechanics at its own pace, gives the player time to breathe, doesn't heap on every mechanic at the same time.
The Tutorials are also pretty good, instead of just text, they put the player in an environment where they use the mechanic. along with some helpful, very short text guiding the player along.
And the Bosses! They may be a little hard, but the euphoria you receive after finally beating a hard boss you were struggling on is incomparable to any other joy in the game

Hollow Knight,367520,208454198,"Hollow Knight is SO far from the type of games I normally enjoy. Metroidvania, souls-like, and precision platforming are all things I tend to despise and ultimately rage quit. I have little patience for games that force you to grind the same thing over and over and over again. All that being said I was incredibly pleasantly surprised by this game. The learning curve is perfectly manageable. If I'm feeling like a little baby I can come back to a fight later or ignore it all together. I rarely need a break to cool my jets. The art style and sound design is beautiful, and the dialogue is short and sweet. No matter how good a game is, if it's ugly I lose interest, but that's far from an issue with the world of Hollow Knight.
So if you normally play these types of games, OBVIOUSLY you'll enjoy this game. But what I'm saying is if maybe you DON'T normally like these types of games, you should probably give Hollow Knight a try. You might surprise yourself.

Now that that's out of the way, hi :)
Uh, the game is fine, I guess. I hate how the progression works, and I hate how hard some of the bosses are simply because they throw enough things at you all at once. The game itself is great, the story is really intriguing, but god I hate how progression works. Not only is it the furthest thing from linear, but if you ever set the game down before the 10 hour mark, you're gonna spend the next session playing detective to try and figure out what you were doing, where you were going, and what the current goals are. I hate that this game doesn't have a proper quest system, nor does it really give you any hints.
I understand that half of the appeal is being able to go around and unlock new areas in previous areas you thought had already been explored, and while the environments look amazing and flow... fine, well, they get boring after you backtrack for the 40th time through them. It gets really repetitive, really fast. 
Despite all of that, though, I still really like the game. It's relatively simple in terms of mechanics, but it feels really nice, and while some of the bosses make me want to pull my hair out, most of them seem to be fair for their stage of progression (I still hate how progression is handled, though).",True,0,816

Hollow Knight,367520,208393035,"As a big fan of Metroidvanias and hard games such as the Dark Souls series, I felt that Hollow Knight would totally be up my alley - but whenever I saw a clip of gameplay I never got excited, so I didn't purchase it. With the release of Silksong and a nice sale, I felt I should finally give it a chance.
I have put in about 9 hours now, and I'm not sure if I'm going to continue playing, as the game doesn't really feel that engaging to me.
EDIT: I have finished the game after about 22 hours of playing, and my earlier assessment remains mostly unchanged.


The Negatives:

- The gameplay feels incredibly slow and boring before you get the Dash ability. In the early game, you can do a grand total of three things: walk, slash, jump. No ranged options, dodging, blocking, parrying, or even crouching. Consquently, combat also feels really limited and boring, and this barely changes with the few combat-relevant abilities you subsequently gain. Even towards the end of the game, I never felt that combat was interesting. Another reason for this shortcoming is that:

- Enemies aren't very engaging, and the vast majority of them uses the grand strategy of running into the player character. After some time playing I mostly tried to avoid combat because it's just tedious.

- The environments are visually beautiful, but not very interesting to navigate through; the different biomes all feel pretty much the same. For example, Greenpath looks very different compared to The Crossroads, but it doesn't _feel_ different and it doesn't play different: it's all platforms with pits.
I also kind of stopped looking for secret passages, because there's rarely anything of interest to find: at best, you'll be rewarded with a bit of money or a cryptic two-liner of lore. The truly relevant stuff such as new charms is usually hidden in plain sight. Related point:

- The environmental / jump & run challenges don't work well with the rest of the game. For example, approaching the City of Tears requires the player to do a number of tricky jumps/dashes, and it's designed well. However, failure is punished with HP loss, and there's not a lot of HP to go around. Consequence: instead of being able to keep trying, the player has to turn around and grind enemies for HP (or die and run all the way back from the last bench).
On the one hand, I feel that Hollow Knight could've used more such challenges, and I found the existing ones more engaging than combat; on the other hand, such gameplay lends itself to a game which is more lenient with its challenge (e.g. in 2D Metroid games failure in jump & run segments is often punished just with wasted time, or if HP is lost it is not a significant portion of overall HP).

- The game requires a lot of backtracking. Fast travel points are few and far between, and the world is clearly set up in a way that requires the player to return to previous areas a lot - which sucks, because most areas are barely interesting when you pass them the first time. This also makes enemies & environments appear even more boring, because you are constantly forced to cross sections you'be been in before again and again.

- The map system is dumb. I have to find an NPC in a new area before I can use the map? After I have purchased every single item the mapmaker shop offers, my character can't map on his own in a new area? What nonsense is this? What gameplay benefit is this supposed to achieve?


The Positives:

- Somewhat a matter of taste, but the difficulty feels well-balanced to me; So far, I wouldn't mind if the game was more difficult. The system of gathering Soul to power both HP recovery and abilities is clever.

- NPCs and their dialogues, and the lore in general, is great.

- Charms offer many interesting options for character building.

- Snappy and precise controls.


Toss-up:

- Music: I'll happily admit that the music is atmospheric, and it fits the game well, but... I can't say I feel it is outstanding.


CONCLUSION:
I don't think Hollow Knight is a bad game, and I can absolutely see why people enjoy it. But if I had to rate it based on my gameplay experience so far, I'd probably give it a 6 or perhaps 7 out of 10. I simply don't see the masterpiece it has been hailed as, and in all honesty, I'd rather play any of the Castlevanias or 2D Metroids instead. As such, I wouldn't recommend Hollow Knight to friends... hence my 'not recommended' rating.",False,0,553

I had never played a metroidvania before, and was not used the the gameplay, and it took a while to get good. 
One of the things I do remember from my first playthrough was getting destroyed by the mantis lords a few too many times than I'd like to admit (granted, I had only been playing for 2-3 hours, so it wasn't like I was good yet), and eventually beating them and feeling so incredibly proud of myself. Other highlights from my first playthrough include bawling my eyes out at the ending [spoiler]when the hollow knight starts stabbing himself[/spoiler], ragequitting in the white palace because I suck(ed) at platforming, and thinking grey prince zote's intro is comedic gold. And then there's the music. Boy, is there music.
Some people think it's weird to listen to video game OSTs on a regular basis whenever you are not playing the game and listening to the music in the game. Those people are missing out on one of the greatest musical scores of all time. Christopher Larkin absolutely nailed the Hollow Knight soundtrack. Every track is so fitting, so perfect, so moving and beautiful. Queen's Gardens, Reflection, and Greenpath are what I wake up to every day, and starting my day with wonderful memories of Hallownest and its beauty makes waking up so much easier. It's serenity embodied, and it's enough to make a grown man cry. And then there are tracks like Sealed Vessel. The Grimm Troupe. Nightmare King. Pure Vessel. Holy shit are these bangers. The difficulty of these fights (I guess this only applies to Pure Vessel and NKG) matched with their music makes them all the more memorable. Pure Vessel's somber, slowly building theme is perfect for his lore and the sheer AURA in the fight entrance the first time, it all just fits so well. Same goes for NKG, god DAMN I struggled with that boss fight but the music and the precision made it feel like a dance to the death, jetstream sam style. Every move, every swing, every dodge mattered. Did I mention I love this game?
Hollow Knight has brought me an immense amount of joy over the 100 hours I've played, and the few years I've owned it, and I am proud to say that it is hands-down the best video game I have ever played and one of the best video games ever developed. I would give anything to erase my memory and travel through the ruins of Hallownest for the first time again. To experience the choral part of the City of Tears OST while looking out the window besides Quirrel on the bench, to the smile that crosses my face every time I free a grub and hear the adorable sound they make, to the tragic lore of the fall of Hallownest and the efforts to save it, Hollow Knight has made me feel things I never thought a video game could make me feel. I truly believe that this is the most enjoyment I've ever gotten for 15 bucks I think I got this game for? What a steal. Anyways, stop reading this review and go buy the damn game. If you want to get lost in the best video game lore ever made while playing a platformer where you fight silly little bugs (and later god), Hollow Knight is for you.",True,1,6221

Some cons (mostly minor) are that the game has huge and complex zones with plenty of backtracking. Fast travel is not good enough, so you'll end up manually going through majority of the zones and you'll waste a lot of time. Some zones are impossible to go through until you find a certain item, but most of the times you wouldn't know if the newly acquired item unlocked something or where to use it, so you'll have to either explore everything again or simply search for a guide online (which I ended up doing at some point, because there's was just too much searching for where to go). Also your map has no indicator for your current position until you sacrifice an item slot and a bit of your personal power.

Hollow Knight,367520,208344558,"Its an enjoyable game but I feel like its also something more of an ""experience"". To me it doesn't really stand out a lot against other Metroidvania games like Ori, Bloodstained, Momodora or Ender Lilies. Given that the game itself doesn't really have any weak points though, it does make for a good gateway into the genre.

The environments, enemies, art and sound direction are all fairly nice. The story is presented in a breadcrumb fashion, so that might be hit or miss depending on if that's your sort of thing.

Edit: I think I was a bit too harsh with my phrasing on the initial review, while I still stand by the game not excelling at aspects, I think its overall a very good complete package. Its very consistent in its presentation, escalation and gameplay without any large spikes or jumps. Everything progresses naturally so its a smooth ride from start to finish. Due to this, while I think something like the above titles are better ""games"", Hollow Knight is both a better ""experience"" and package. I also feel that this is true of Silksong.

I first bought Hollow Knight for PS4 about 7-6 years ago and quickly got bored of it in an hour or two, because i didn't know what to do and were just wandering in forgotten crossroads aimlessly. This time when I didn't know what to do, I just opened a Steam guide to know what i should do next.

Hollow Knight was a fairly easy game overall, with a few difficulty increases in optional bosses, some of which I haven't even beaten yet. It offers at least a couple dozen hours of gameplay, with plenty more if you explore everything and try getting every achievement. 

Overall amazing game, great soundtracks/music, enjoyable boss fights, smooth movement, nice graphics, good lore, and well-made NPCs.

Well, at first I thought this game would just be fun and relaxing to play, but as I got deeper and started chasing every achievement, I realized Hollow Knight isn’t really about fun anymore. !!!!!IT'S ABOUT CHALLENGE!!!!!. This game might be indie, but it truly feels like a Souls game. The difficulty, the atmosphere, the sense of reward everything pushes you to your limits. For now, I’d call this my Souls game No. 3. completion Achievement.

Honestly, I wasn’t really into this game at the beginning and didn’t find it that interesting. But my friend dared me to get all the achievements, so I accepted the challenge. After a lot of struggle, I finally reached 100% achievements and guess what? My friend is still stuck at 60%. Shame on him,😆 DIABY_MD.

In the end, Hollow Knight might not be the game I started for fun, but it became one of the most rewarding challenges I’ve ever completed. i would recommend for newbie player and enjoy :)",True,0,7778

Hollow Knight,367520,208305516,"This game fully deserves most of the praise it gets. Art style, combat, music, enemy variety, boss design, difficulty, level design, exploration, it's all done really well.

But the excessive backtracking just completely kills the whole experience.

Metroidvanias are all about unlocking new movement abilities, and then going back to the areas you've already explored and being able to access new paths that were previously inaccessible. This is a key part of their progressions systems and one of the most satisfying things about them.

In Hollow Knight, this is the worst part of the game because fast travel is extremely limited and the levels are long and the movement somewhat slow. Backtracking to a previously explored area can easily take 10-15 minutes. And you can easily die along the way and have to re-backtrack from the last bench (Dark Souls-like checkpoint) you rested at.

Then, once you've done whatever it is that you went back there for, you now have to make the round trip. 

The only saving grace is that you can quit out to the main menu and load back into the game, and this will teleport you back to the last bench you used. But you can't teleport between benches without mods, so you'll probably still have to backtrack for 5-10 minutes to get to one of the very rare fast travel stations. 

Also, having to quit out to the main menu so often destroys the immersion.  

Backtracking isn't an accidental problem, either. The game deliberately adds as much of it as possible. Various shopkeepers   and key NPCs are located far from fast travel stations to force you to backtrack even more. The only vendor that buys vendor trash requires backtracking to get to, and accompanies every single generic sale with boring dialogue, for no reason whatsoever. Why is this the case? Why isn't this vendor just located in the main hub town? Why can't you just bulk-sell stuff to him? 

None of this is challenging or fun. The game is just designed to waste your time.

I really liked Hollow Knight at first, but the backtracking just slowly grinded me down. 

Eventually, after backtracking for 10+ minutes to kill an optional boss, I looked at the map and the looooooong trip back, and I just thought ""nah, I'm, good"".",False,18,953

Hollow Knight,367520,208296837,"[b]TL;DR[/b]
A beautiful and mysterious world buried under layers of deliberate inconvenience. Every design choice seems to scream: “What if we made this more confusing?” Gorgeous, but exhausting.

[h3]Pros[/h3]

+ Beautiful world, stunning art direction, great atmosphere.
+ Music and sound design are absolutely top-notch.
+ Boss fights are intense and fair — in theory.
+ The lore is deep and intriguing — once you give up and watch it explained on YouTube.

[h3]Cons[/h3]

[b]Navigation & Map Design[/b]
- Biomes look drastically different from each other, but rooms within the same biome all look the same.
- Corridors and intersections lack distinct landmarks — making it nearly impossible to remember where each path leads.
- Yes, there are signs pointing to benches or cities, but they form long chains of arrows that don’t actually help you remember anything.
- The world is chopped into small rooms, which only adds to the confusion. Seamless travel could’ve helped navigation, but for some reason, the developers decided to stick with room-based transitions that make everything feel disjointed.

The map is another story altogether:
- You only get a map of a region if you find the cartographer — who somehow teleports ahead of you even if you run in a straight line. And the cartographer makes only half of the map; the other part you fill in yourself, which makes you a cartographer as well. But for some artificial reason, you can map only some rooms while relying on him for others. It makes no sense!
- To see your position on the map, you must equip a compass charm that takes up a precious combat slot. So you end up juggling this charm on before exploring and off before a boss fight — adding nothing of value to the experience, only annoyance.
- Automatic map markers are often placed right on top of passages, hiding important paths behind icons.
- Custom markers are nearly useless — you get four bleak colors, no text, and no way to remember what each one means.

[b]Boss Fights & Repetition[/b]
- Bosses are tough, fair, and often fun. The real problem is the [b]repetition[/b]. You’ll die, then spend several minutes running the same path to that boss again. Over. And over. And over. It feels like the devs thought: “What if we made players repeat the same corridor fifty times to appreciate the atmosphere?”
- The final boss is especially exhausting: beat Boss A, then Boss B, then Boss B again, then Boss B again — and every time you die, you restart from the very beginning. It’s not that hard — it’s just artificially punishing, and quickly becomes dull and frustrating.

[b]Story & Lore[/b]
- The world itself is beautiful, melancholic, and full of potential. But the story is told through fragments and vague, disconnected lines.
- Most NPCs speak in riddles that sound deep but add nothing of actual meaning. By the twentieth cryptic monologue, it started feeling like they were just wasting my time on purpose. I love collecting lore and piecing together a story, but here it felt like trying to assemble a puzzle with half the pieces missing and no picture on the box. In the end, I learned the story from YouTube — not from the game itself.

[b]General Design Philosophy[/b]
- Everything in Hollow Knight feels like it was made [b]confusing for the sake of confusion[/b] and [b]inconvenient for the sake of inconvenience[/b]. UI, navigation, map, dialogue — every system seems to go out of its way to test your patience. It’s not the difficulty that frustrates — it’s the deliberate, artificial friction built into everything.
The devs managed to balance irritation so precisely that it somehow attracted a cult of masochists defending it.

[b]Controller Hell[/b]
- Downward slash on a controller is nearly impossible to perform consistently.
- Dash on a squeaky trigger gets old fast.
- Charging an attack and jumping can’t be done together (both actions require the right thumb).
- After playing through about 80% of the game, I had to completely relearn everything on keyboard — which is its own form of pain.
The fact that the game officially claims “controller supported” feels misleading. They might as well write:
“You can technically play with a controller, but good luck trying to do pogo attacks!”

[h3]Conclusion[/h3]
Hollow Knight is breathtaking to look at, haunting to listen to, and conceptually brilliant.
But underneath that, it’s a maze of frustration — a game that constantly reminds you how much smoother and more enjoyable it [i]could’ve been[/i].
It’s not a “soulslike challenge”; it’s a [b]user experience horror[/b].",False,5,4050

Hollow Knight,367520,208285998,"Overrated. I bought this game just to see what all the hype is about. I finished the Ori series a few years ago and I don't mind playing side-scrolling platforming games.

The mechanics are simple and straightforward. But it suffers from the same issue I have with the Dark Souls games -- forced tediousness. Everytime you die you are forced to walk the through same tedious (and often boring) path over and over again just to recover your money. 

I don't mind hard games. I've played Sekiro countless times. I played Doom Eternal in hardest difficulty countless times. What I hate are TEDIOUS games -- games that FORCE you to suffer repetition for no reason other than because the devs want you to punish you with boredom because of your mistakes.

Did you just die from a boss? Well tough luck, you have to travel 100km up and down the same path just to recover your ghost and the money it's carrying. Do you keep dying from the spikes on the wall because you can't get the platforming down? Well tough luck, you will again have to travel 100km up and down the same boring path just to repeat that tedious platforming challenge.

The art style is also overrated. I don't feel anything for the hand-drawn cartoon style in the same way I felt love for Ori's art style. I don't mind it, I just don't feel anything for it.

Lastly the story is also overrated. It again borrows a lot of its style from the Dark Souls series -- cryptic and ambiguous. 8 hours in and I only have the faintest idea of what my character's goal is. Compare that with the Ori series: Straight away you are given the premise, and you as the player know exactly what the conflict is, and what your grand overarching goal is. It's just a matter of achieving that goal.

Ori was the better game. Both Ori 1 and 2 were excellent in terms of gameplay, art style, and story telling.

the original point where i quit was the soul sanctum section. this was due probably my lack of backtracking and finding or buying useful charms that would of helped me in this section. i also wasnt skillful enough to take on the enemies of that area at that stage.

At its core, Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania where you don't lose all your exploration progress if you die. But what makes it great is how tight the controls are - you have so much precision about where you're going, how to avoid attacks, and everything.

Fair warning, it's not the easiest game. But I can think of only one part which is both required and seemed a little too tough for when it pops up - and even then you can go off and explore for damage and ability upgrades if you want to, the game's pretty open as to where you can go after you get a couple of movement upgrades.

Hollow Knight,367520,208225219,"Filtered by White Palace and lack of patience. This is not important to the review I'm just being forthcoming about my skill.

It's Hollow Knight, if the sheer glut of ""Silksong gud!"" content doesn't convince you to seek this out this review probably won't either, but I'm gonna try.

Pros: Beautiful art direction, music that sounds like it belongs in a fancy auditorium, and some of the tightest 2d platforming and combat that I've played since SotN to be honest with you. You want exploration, multiple endings, excellent characters, and lore? There is all that and more here. Hornet got her own game because of the Kickstarter sure, but that doesn't mean she didn't earn that game with her part in the story. Hollow Knight is Silksong's tutorial and while I never finished it? I'm loving Silksong just fine.",True,0,2867

I played Silksong right after playing this game for the 2nd time and I will say, even though Silksong improves upon essentially everything, this is its own game that shines more then most games I have ever played.
Similar to my Silksong review, the world, music, bosses, combat, just the constant urge to want to keep exploring and discover more about Hallownest's deep lore and secrets. The game is one of the most backlogged games ever for a reason. I pray everyone gives this masterpiece a try and the chance to experience playing this game and Silksong back to back like I did, because it will forever be one of the most unforgettable franchises I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing and I want nothing more then for Team Cherry to keep hopefully providing.",True,1,3754

Hollow Knight,367520,208177520,"I had the chance to play Hollow Knight for the first time in April 2024. I hadn’t watched any trailers and expected something like Ori mixed with Dark Souls — and I fell in love within the first few hours.

Hollow Knight has it all: a perfect soundtrack, precise and satisfying movement, countless amazing boss fights, and a dark, mysterious world that keeps expanding the more you explore. The variety of biomes is incredible — you lose count of how many there actually are. Every essential feature you could hope for exists in the game, and you’ll discover them naturally as you explore the world with both eyes open (which also helps you appreciate just how beautiful this game truly is).

I’ve never played another game with such rewarding hidden locations. Thanks to its outstanding soundtrack and art direction, I never hesitated to revisit previous areas. Many boss fights require sharp platforming and quick reactions, which makes every victory even more satisfying.

The base game alone is a 10/10, and the three free DLCs elevate it even further. My only small criticisms are that some things are hidden too well — you might miss the PoP, the entrance to the third DLC, or even certain charms.

Hollow Knight is one of my favorite games of all time, and I haven’t even started talking about the lore, the NPCs, their unique sound effects, or the questlines. It’s a game that brings together everything I love: Metroidvania exploration, diverse biomes, quirky animal-like NPCs, epic boss battles, a detailed bestiary, a rich orchestral soundtrack, and a dark, mysterious world with a Souls-like story quietly running in the background.

I honestly can’t recommend any game more than this!",True,0,5630
Hollow Knight,367520,208176421,"Very atmospheric game. Some areas, especially City of Tears have spellbound me with music and vibes. Game progression is well made, first you barely survive in this world but slowly your nail gets stronger, you learn new moving and attacking skills eventually becoming the killing machine of Hallownest. Bosses are different. Some hold special place in my heart (Mantis Lords, Dung Defender, Hollow Knight, 
[spoiler]Radiance[/spoiler] ) because of how fun their fights are and some I just want to forget, luckily there are very few of bad bosses. 

Lore and story seem complex at first but are in fact quite simple, even if you didn't understand everything in game, you can watch any good video on youtube. Characters, despite quite small amount of dialogues, are really memorable since they are really well written. I love Quirrel and Hornet, those, who help you on your way, Sly, who is pretty interesting and you will find out why, and of course I won't forget Cornifer, Iselda, Bretta, Zote and others you meet.",True,0,3132

Hollow Knight,367520,208154342,"Hollow Knight is one of those rare games that feels handcrafted with love in every pixel. The world of Hallownest is vast, mysterious, and melancholy — filled with quiet stories and secrets waiting to be discovered.

The combat is precise and satisfying, the art direction is stunning, and the soundtrack perfectly captures the game’s somber tone. It never holds your hand, but rewards exploration and perseverance in a way few games manage.

Pros:

- Gorgeous hand-drawn art
- Deep, challenging combat
- Atmospheric world design
- Incredible soundtrack
- Constant sense of discovery

Cons:
- You’ll die a lot (but you’ll learn from it)
- You may get lost (often)

Hollow Knight,367520,208142742,"The fact that Hollow Knight has held up it's popularity for so many years goes to show how good this game is. It is a metroidvania style game, with fun combat and a hand drawn art style, with a large map to explore, abilities to unlock, and secrets to uncover.

The game features a small but mighty bug warrior who returns to a forgotten and crumbling kingdom below the surface to learn about his past. As I mentioned, it was a very large world to explore. With several different and unique areas to find, there was always something new to do or discover. I also liked how unique every area was, ranging from lush gardens to desolate lands below the ground to forgotten cities, making each area a memorable experience. There also is a wide variety of enemies to fight, with each of them having different attacks, movements, and skills, making you have to constantly adapt to what environment you're in. The bosses were also very fun, with each having it's own abilities and movements. There also are a ton of bosses in Hollow Knight, so there will always be somebody new to fight. There is just so much unique and exciting content, the game never feels stale.

I also just want to mention how amazing the music was. Every track was incredible, complimenting the locations and events in which they are played in like I have never seen before in a video game. The art style also complimented the overall mood of the game so well, with it's hand drawn style and detailed backgrounds. I also liked the charming characters, who all have their own personalities and stories. Since the lands of Hallownest are mostly devoid of non-hostile life, It was very fun encountering a new character, and they all added a little life into the empty lands. They also did such a good job on the secrets, with all of them being rewarding and fun to uncover. The game also gives you little guidance on what to do. This is actually a good thing because the game is hard enough that you feel accomplished when you discover something new, but not hard enough that you constantly need to look up tutorials on what to do. The same can be said about the difficulty. It's hard enough to be a ""hard game"" and make you feel prideful in your achievements, but not hard enough that you want to punch a hole in your monitor.

If I had to say 1 bad thing about Hollow Knight, it would be how the story felt slightly obscure and hard to comprehend, and you have to piece it together yourself. Good thing that the story is not really needed to enjoy the game.

So in short, Hollow Knight is a masterpiece of video games, and I highly recommend to most people. If you are wondering if you'll get your moneys worth from this game, trust me you will. It almost feels wrong to be paying only $15 for this incredible game. This has to be one of, if not the easiest 10/10 I have ever given to a game.

",True,0,2309
Hollow Knight,367520,208141884,"Hollow Knight has so many things going for it. The art style, animations and the soundtrack are beautiful. The world is immersive and the story is engaging. Input is overall very responsive and the gameplay and movement are pretty fluid. I love exploring the map. 

Yet, with all that said, I simply don't enjoy this game. Getting through some sections feels like a chore. Personally, I don't find the combat satisfying and I haven't enjoyed a single boss fight. I don't mind difficult games and consider myself fairly competent at them, but I struggle with the combat in this game because I simply don't find it fun. I haven't struggled too much with the corpse runs like some other players, but that is also a pretty annoying mechanic for someone who has limited time to put into playing a game. I still think this game might be worth a try if you enjoy metroidvania style games, but don't assume you'll love it because you liked Ori or even Cuphead for the matter. I really wish I liked this game more considering the time I've put into it already.",False,1,2066

If that kind of addictive exploring is your thing, this is your game. However, it is hard imo. 

Game scared me off the first time because it seemed hard and unforgiving. [spoiler](I thought I permanently lost all my geo when I died.)[/spoiler]

I gave it another chance, struggled, got better, got through the first boss, second boss. One time I had to have my brother get me out of a difficult area because I was just sick of it. But I practised, got better, can now do those areas with ease, fought most of the most challenging bosses in the game, even did a no death run succesfully in the end, for a game I almost rage-quit because I thought the starting area was to hard for me already.

This game taught me that I can do difficult games, and I've since tried other games on harder settings. It taught me that a challenging difficulty in a game can be fun and fulfilling. Some optional bosses I had to return to a half year later becausu i couldn't do it at the time, but in the end I persevered. Now whenever I face a challenge, I know that I went from 'I can't do this game', to beating the  [spoiler]white palace and even path of pain later[/spoiler], to beating  [spoiler]the radiance[/spoiler], to beating  [spoiler]hollow knight on steel soul[/spoiler]. I can do so much that I once thought impossible. Truly a life-changing game for me. 

TLDR: Addictive metroidvenia, challenging but worth it

Play if you
- Like a challenge and have the time/patience to improve, or are already decent at this kind of game.
- Want a game with good artstyle, fun music, backtracking to re-explore areas in new fun ways

Do not play (or instead just watch a playthrough) if you:
- Aren't that skilled yet at these types of games and can't / don't want to learn. Which is perfectly fine :)
- Dislike challenging games",True,0,12886

I thought that before playing this, I would play it once or twice and be done with it (I like sandbox games by the way). However, I have played this (so far) for 130+ hours, as the different ways you can play, ease of modding, and all of the different skips and movement techniques that you can perform, it makes it really rewarding to practice your skills.
The extra, free (and already included) DLCs make this game even better, and add a lot more to do late-game.

Hollow Knight,367520,208122463,"Having just finished the story for this game (true ending achieved), I must say I have mixed feelings about it.

I play as bug in a world of bugs and I have always known that ""the only good bug is a dead bug"". I love Starship Troopers and Helldivers so everything just felt wrong and out of place. I was so conflicted, it was like I was betraying everything I stood for. I was wondering ""what am I doing here?"" or ""How can I bring myself to do this, to betray democracy and everything I stand for?"" or even ""Who am I?""

These questions haunted me for a good while but then I finally had the answer: I am a bug, yes, but here I am killing all the other bugs. I'm a traitor bug that found clarity and decided to destroy every last one of the other bugs! It was glorious! I had no more remorse about being a bug, now I could just kill them all freely.

I found an hunter, like myself, that gave me a journal which helped me compile information about the other bugs and as we all know ""to fight the bug we must understand the bug"". So I gathered information about the enemy and I went on a killing spree. I ended up finishing the journal and my mentor was proud of me. My mission was done. 

I killed every single bug there was! That is, except from one... 

Hornet, I will see you in Pharloom and you will not escape me this time.",True,1,2877
Hollow Knight,367520,208122460,"[Significant end/post-game spoiler ahead!]
I don't think I've ever fallen in love with a game so quickly as with Hollow Knight. The combat, the music, the lore, the sound design, the bosses, the motifs, the areas, all of it.

The only thing I like less is how inconsequential the final boss(es) feel. Everything about them is so dramatic and screams that this is a grand finale, the zenith of your adventure. You defeat them, the cutscene plays, the credits roll and you're sent to a new main menu. You join back into your save and...nothing. It's like the fight never happened. You received nothing except a main menu background and an achievement, and the Infection is still rampant throughout Forgotten/Infected Crossroads.

Regardless, everything else this game has to offer more than makes up for this. Love this game, looking forward to trying Silksong.",True,0,6160

Also you can play for hours just grinding money and upgrading the character's skills and collecting charms. Or you can proceed with the story, you can easily get lost in the game but that makes it more fun, finding you way around the map and you get this really good feeling after killing a boss you spent hours on finding/killing. Would recommend, plus the story is interesting; doesn't take up much storage or money to download this. Edit: way bigger than i first thought, tons of mini, big bosses to drag you into the game; you can watch tutorials for the bosses or spend at least 2 hours to learn a boss's attack pattern and killing it. U can also replay the game as much as you want. Warning : you will get addicted to this.",True,0,2407

Unlike modern single player games that hold your hand to make you understand every mechanic or point you to the next plot for the story, Hollow Knight offers a balanced challenge between your hands and brains. The difficulty of bosses and parkour all depend on the players' playstyle and strategy, boss difficulty is unique per player. Similarly, the game is fully non-linear. You can go explore one area until you hit a roadblock and explore another, and so on. 

Overall, if you want a great single-player game with a good story and forgiving mechanics, this game is a must pick-up, especially considering the price is a really cheap bargain for the amount of content.",True,0,3086

Never before has every death felt like it counted towards my progress, inching my way through a bosses health bar till I finally managed to best it.

-Rewarding exploration

-Free DLC added to base game
-Fun challenges and achievements
-High replay value
-Deep lore with variety of methods of storytelling to communicate it
-Memorable NPCs
-Gorgeous artwork and soundtrack

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Input controls can be imprecise at times, leading to problems in precision platforming sections
-Some bosses have a frustrating RNG element to them (Looking at you, Grey Prince Zote)

[b]Overall:[/b] You know what this game is. I don't even know why I'm reviewing it except I felt like it needed to be praised one more time. Hollow Knight is one of those generational gaming experiences, at least it has been for me. There's a lot of cookie cutter nonsense out there, and on the surface, having one more side scrolling metroidvania definitely sounds boring. But Team Cherry did it flawlessly, and made the world and game with obvious care and love.

Any complaints I have are minor. The game rewards exploration and has fun challenges, not all of which lead to any substantial reward or have an achievement attached. The game is just fun to play, and rewards you for playing it. It's fantastic game design, and I loved the little easter eggs scattered throughout the game waiting to be discovered.

If you haven't tried this, and you're here because everyone is hyped about Silksong, you owe it to yourself to play this game. For me, I'm off to Silksong now that I've enjoyed my time here.

Hollow Knight,367520,207961908,"Hollow Knight: An Indie Masterpiece

Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania — a genre built around exploration, backtracking, and unlocking new paths through new abilities. It’s not flashy, it doesn’t hold your hand, and the gameplay is surprisingly simple. You’re just a tiny bug with a nail. Yet, through that simplicity, the game shines brighter than most AAA titles. It’s pure, precise platforming action that rewards patience and mastery.

The presentation is phenomenal. The art style feels like Tim Burton meets a Saturday morning cartoon — dark but charming, creepy but beautiful. The music and sound design sell the atmosphere perfectly, making the world of Hallownest feel alive and haunting.

Gameplay evolves as you progress. New movement abilities like the dash and double jump turn exploration into fast-paced platforming challenges, and the Charm system adds fun layers of customization. Geo management — your currency for upgrades, charms, and maps — encourages careful spending and even risk-taking when you have to retrieve it after dying.

Of course, it’s not perfect. The backtracking can get exhausting, the lack of clear direction can frustrate, and early progression feels punishing for newcomers. The story is vague and cryptic, told in that “FromSoftware” style where half the mystery is figuring out what’s going on. Boss runs can be tedious due to long treks between save points, and the difficulty curve isn’t always even.

But even with its flaws, Hollow Knight is a masterpiece. It doesn’t reinvent its genre — it makes it feel brand new. From a three-person indie team, this level of polish, atmosphere, and heart is unbelievable. In a world full of bloated AAA games, Hollow Knight reminds me what makes video games special.

Final Verdict: 9/10 – A haunting, challenging, beautiful journey worth every swing of the nail.

Quite rewarding as most souls-likes should be. The only critique I have is a mistake of my own; not properly utilizing map markers to signify where I needed to backtrack once I unlocked later abilities that opened new pathways.

At review time, I only have the map for the forgotten crossroads, have visited four out of the five areas that surround it, and have only defeated the main boss in FC, and Hornet in the Green Path. By my calculations, I've lost around 4000 geos from dying so much.

Hollow Knight,367520,207839748,"I have never really played any games like this. Hollow Knight was my introduction, and I don't think I could have picked a better one. The art is absolutely beautiful. If I die in stupid ways, it's because I'm too busy appreciating the art.

The gameplay follows a very natural flow, and whenever I have to backtrack, it doesn't feel as annoying as it did in Metroid. (Probably the only game like Hollow Knight I've ever played.) The characters are all really fun and interesting, but none as much as the Might Zote, who is the best character in the game, despite what many people would have you believe.

I love the way the movement feels. I feel totally in control of my character, and it contributes to why I don't have any issue with the difficulty: if I die, I know what I did wrong, and I feel totally in control of doing better. The game doesn't feel unfair, just challenging, and I really like that.

Currently working on p5, but it'll probably be a while until I succeed. I will go for 112%. Will probably try to get all achievements, too. I rarely find the motivation to go all the way with large games like this, but Hollow Knight is just that good.",True,0,10969

I think the hardest part was getting a feeling for this game, at least for me. The game dropped you into a strange and hostile world, only telling you the controls, the rest is up to you. I had big problems with the map itself, didn't really know what to do and where to go. Was the main reason I quit. But after discovering more and more, something clicked. It was really fun getting new abilities, so you can progress somewhere else. This game does that pretty well, after a while you always have a hinge what to do next. 
Combat and parkour is fun. Love the hand drawn world, lots of love was put into this. Also the soundtrack is a big plus.

It made a solid impression on me but after a couple of bosses I put the game down in favor of some life obligations. When I got back into gaming, didnt go back to Hollow Knight until I heard about the hype for Silksong recently. 

I booted it back up and wow, its one of the best in the 2d-mele-platformer-darksouls-like-metroidvania genre. Only No Nine Sols that I played on Game Pass recently is as good or better but then again its more inspired from Sekiro's deflect mechanic and they are building on the shoulders of giants like Team Cherry that have blazed a trail in this genre and indie space!

",False,0,4152
Hollow Knight,367520,207752449,"Awesome design, sounds, music, the world overall is very enjoyable to look and listen, the atmosphere created by the game is awesome.

However i didn't like combat at all, and since it takes 70% of the game if not more, 
the game left me with negative emotions.

Majority of damage and deaths in this game feels unfair. One of examples is when one certain boss had little summons spawning, and they were the same color as background of the arena. But also they could spawn near you or even inside you, which makes you take damage just because you are unlucky. Also you could see many negative reviews about primal aspid, which covers a lot of screen with its attack and just super hard to dodge because of it, especially when the arena is very limited. There is much more such moments that feel unfair and i don't find this kind of challenge satisfying, its more like frustrating.

Also the game felt like its lacking some combat options, you only have a nail, [spoiler]dash, double jump and 3 spells or so, which are practically the same, differing only in the direction of attack, not doing any effect beside damage and pushing enemy away[/spoiler] so at one point i felt like bosses can do a lot of staff, damage me in a countless ways possible, and i can just... well strike with a nail that's all. Oh and use a [spoiler]spell [/spoiler] which does some damage, but uses soul, so you sacrifice your healing potential. Charms system is good, but it doesn't change gameplay much, sometimes is just gives a small buff which could improve your quality of life, but your combat cycle won't change anyway.

And of course, the amount of backtracking is really big, the game has fast travel system, but it doesn't cover all the parts of a map, just some of them, so you gotta run around the map just to find some path you couldn't unlock until now. Or find some item you couldn't use until now. Or run to the boss which just killed you. By the way there is an [spoiler]ability which allows you to travel to the one location you set yourself, but you get it really late into the game and it didn't feel like i saved much time with it[/spoiler]

And that brings to the next problem, these paths aren't marked on the map. Lets say you found a path you can't reach due to lacking some item, and you have to return here later. The problem is that on the map it will look like you didn't go that way. So if you made some pause between your gaming sessions, you will need to remember which paths are locked, and which ones you just haven't visited because you had crossroad and chose to go another path. To solve this issue partially developers let you buy some pins, which serve like a markers you can set on map, but i don't understand why they are not available right away, and must be purchased from some npc, and why it cannot be done automatically, since some ways obviously require some certain item and absolutely cannot be accessed without it.

So overall i recommend to play this game and see if you like it yourself, and if you find the combat unsatisfying just like i did, just go finish only necessary bosses, since they are much easier than optional ones.

Hollow Knight,367520,207713676,"First Metroidvania game I’ve ever played, and I had never touched difficult games before. But thanks to Hollow Knight, I’ve entered the world of souls-like games. It’s really hard, and I loved it so much that I went for the platinum trophy (some achievements, especially P5, are insanely difficult).

At the beginning, the game feels a bit empty — the world is desolate and there aren’t many mechanics. But as you keep exploring, you discover the true face of this masterpiece.

This game isn’t for baby girls, but if you want to take it slow, not everything and not every boss is mandatory. The game just throws you in with a huge map to explore and lets you figure things out on your own, with very few explanations — and that’s part of its beauty.

While playing, I used a lot of guides, but that’s not necessary at all — it just makes things a bit easier.
The story is really amazing: you are a knight who must save a fallen kingdom from an infection. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t explain much about the lore, so you might need to watch some videos to fully understand it.

Despite its difficulty, the game rarely feels repetitive, and there’s a ton of content to enjoy. For the price it asks, it’s absolutely incredible.

In conclusion, Hollow Knight is a truly fantastic game.
The graphics and environments are stunning, the music is great, and the boss mechanics are simply brilliant.
Highly recommended for those who love exploration, tough challenges, and breathtaking art and atmosphere.",True,0,9161

While the game is alright and perfectly playable, it's also an endless exercise in frustration. It feels like someone decided to make the most irritating game possible. My main impression of the game so far is just that it's all friction, zero payoff.

If you're really really REALLY interested in the game then sure, go for it, play it. But you're honestly just way better off playing one of the many other games in the genre that actually respects the player.",False,1,1209

Great world design, awesome lore, satisfying combat, good difficulty curve, fun bosses, beautiful art direction

I don’t think I’ve had this much fun in a video game in a while. This game gets straight to the point unlike a lot of games these days.

The amount of quality content you get for the price is insane. I’ve played this game for 60+ hours now at the time of writing and there’s still more content left after I got 103%.

Hollow Knight,367520,207693486,"Provavelmente o melhor jogo indie que já joguei, me arrependo de todas as vezes que me recusei a jogar apenas porque eu estava perdido, já que estar perdido é a palavra-chave do que se trata o jogo, um jogo com um visual bonito e com geometrias aperfeiçoadas, design magnífico, sua história é com base em falas de npcs que a gente encontra explorando o mapa, cada gesto que você fizer, a história muda, a criatividade do criador ou doscriadores que criaram esse jogo é infinito, tanto a jogabilidade, quanto a lore é incrível, um grande jogo desafiador como eu queria, com vários bosses com visuais completamente diferentes e digamos que estranhos. As lutas mais fáceis são deixados para trás e as lutas mais difíceis e épicas são emocionantes, porém mal esperamos e precisamos lutar contra uma ordem de bosses sem morrer, eu adoro a dificuldade que o jogo representa, já que gosto de jogos desse tipo. O melhor é que boa parte dos npcs que a gente ve no início do jogo, a gente encontra e precisa deles de novo e acabam sendo importantes até o final do jogo, como o mestre do ferrão Sly. O combate e skills são muito boas, a gente começar literalmente do zero e ainda com habilidades a menos em que a gente precisa conquistas durante o tempo que a gente acaba ganhando se divertindo torna-se desafiador, porém, quando você está evoluído, você se torna muito rapido e precisa de uma habilidade única para se acustumar com as skills e usar nos lugares e horas certas. Os 4 finais, se eu nao me engano, são perfeitos. Eu estou em busca atualmente do quinto panteão para platinar o jogo e completar a última possibilidade de zerar o game.
