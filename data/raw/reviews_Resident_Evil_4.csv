Resident Evil 4,2050650,210239208,"Main story: Good
Separate ways: Bad
The Mercenaries: Mixed
Replayable content: Extremely bad

About main story: Overall, it's been remade just right, and I have no complaints.

Separate ways: Both the story and difficulty leave me with mixed feelings. Especially the fact that Wesker comes to the location feels like a major disconnect.
Also, in terms of difficulty, unlike the main story, there's no armor or even a substitute for it (except for the cap as a clear bonus), so even the standard difficulty feels like HARDCORE level.

The Mercenaries: Fun, except for the ""loading docks"".

Replayable content: I'm quite dissatisfied. Particularly, the inconsistency of the parry system was extremely frustrating. Hearing the knife sound during a parry attempt only to actually get hit was infuriating. (It seems the parry sound occasionally plays even when you take damage, likely due to timing). This happened frequently, especially on PROFESSIONAL difficulty.
I also dislike elements like enemies only placed in PROFESSIONAL mode (especially towards the end of CHAPTER 12).
Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, damage output becomes a major issue in Separate Ways. I couldn't complete PROFESSIONAL S+ without stress.
As for the remaining The Mercenaries mode, the final stage, LOADING DOCKS, completely saps my motivation to get S++ with all characters. Chaos is enough with MODs...",True,0,7990

First of all, Ashley is interesting and seems more mature and smarter+she is not boring with her voice like in the original game RE (2005).
From my opinion, Leon is the best protagonist+agent of RE games.
Ada is as always the most dominant character in the game. ^-^
Bitores Mendez looks like Tyrant's brother (with hat) from RE2. :D
I like the new player costumes.
You can get more of ptas from a merchant than in RE (2005) including a trade and weapons looks powerful.
From my experience, I can say that in RE (2005) is more difficult to kill the enemy (for example Del Lago), while in RE Remake it is easier to perform an attack+moving seems better.
I love every detail done in all the chapters, also the puzzles are easier to solve than in RE (2005).
I will play this game at least 3 more times because it is so exciting to play and it feels like real.
I recommend to everyone!

Resident Evil 4,2050650,210145769,"Many of my hours in game are simply leaving it open. This game represents everything wrong with modern day shooters being slow-brained garbage. Everything wrong with it:

- Graphics are atrocious. Absolutely everything is grey and lifeless. Why is this a thing? It's getting tired
- Obligatory low FOV because that's standard nowadays. ""Hurr durr that thing that restricts your field of view below natural eye levels and makes players nauseous - we're going to keep doing it""
- Takes five seconds to reload - the entire challenge of the game is not really ability but willingness to tolerate all the artificial challenges (low accuracy weapons, long reloads, low ammo, awkward player movement)
- Every vase you break involves a 1-2 second long animation (lol)
- Other unskippable cut-scenes/animations (should NEVER be a thing)
- Enemies sometimes have five (or more) second long dying animations wherein you can't tell if they're still alive or where you simply have to wait all that time to pick up the drops
- Can't strafe
- Can't jump
- Reload doesn't work unless you wait until Leon finishes doing everything completely (like switching the weapon, etc) - every single thing in the game is designed to make you wait and prevent you from playing fast
- Doesn't respect Steam binds - you hit Shift+Tab to bring up the Overlay, and the game brings up the inventory or Photo Mode every single time - then the game doesn't respect Windows keys - you press Esc to exit Photo Mode or what-have-you and it doesn't work. Nope; the one key that's been used to exit menus and things for decades on Windows machines won't work here!
- Can't unload weapons - if a gun is loaded with ammo, the ammo can't be used in another gun which uses the same type
- Can't mute the NPC's constant nonsensical chatter despite the dialogue being muted - chatter can be extremely annoying and loud though adjacent walls and things
- Can't craft while attempting to pick up an item - you have to, of course, given the game, exit your inventory, re-enter, craft, exit, re-pickup the item. lol. Once again, EVERYTHING in this game is designed to make you click and navigate as much as possible and artificially engage you

Resident Evil 4,2050650,210111445,"Was a remake of RE4 necessary? No, but they did an amazing job with it. You should get RE4 Remake as well as the original. Both games are distinct enough to provide different experiences while Remake is still faithful to the original where it counts.

The story is less campy than the original but still has its over the top moments.

The combat is extremely addictive and there's tones of variety and different strategies that will make multiple replays worth while.

The length feels right. It's definitely longer than RE2 and comparable to the original RE4. If you complete the extra objectives on hardcore, you can expect at least 30 hours for your first playthrough. Like the original, this game is meant to be played through more than once, as evidenced by some weapons and accessories only being available for subsequent playthroughs.",True,0,2785

Resident Evil 4,2050650,210023596,"Contender for the best (Action) Resident Evil of all time, for sure.

Gameplay was remixed, refined and redefined to a degree I never would've thought possible for the original RE4. The amount of depth, replayability and skill expression is off the charts for a singleplayer horror game.

The unique art style of the original is lost, but in its place is something much more familiar to fans of the newer RE games. The story attempts to recontextualize the characters and events as being ultra-serious, and mostly does a mediocre job at it. Pretty much any changes relating to the characters and story were disappointments, but they didn't ruin the experience.

The general combat leans more into the Survival-Horror aspects of the series. Staple elements of the original game's design such as staggering enemies with a single headshot are now based on RNG and your weapon of choice, enemies will often drop crafting resources, forcing you to craft the ammo you want instead of being forced to use what the game gives you. Ashley is no longer stuck standing still or glued to your back, instead behaving mostly independent of you, which creates a lot of frustration as she is relegated to being incapacitated in one hit, and killed in a second hit instead of having her own manageable health bar as in the original.",True,0,11152

Resident Evil 4,2050650,209935813,"[h1] 9/10 [/h1]

[h2] PROS: [/h2]
[b] + Visual Design [/b]
Astonishing graphics as usual from RE Engine. Very detailed, amazing lighting.

[b] + Atmosphere [/b]
Even though the game is more of an action game than a survival horror, it still succeeds in creating a tense atmosphere.

[b] + Audio Design [/b]
Typical strong Resident Evil audio design to set up an appropriate atmosphere.

[b] + Combat Mechanics [/b]
Stealth kills and a parry mechanic are introduced.

[b] + Characters [/b]
Intriguing character interactions.

[b] + Inventory/Merchant [/b]
The inventory management, weapon customizations, crafting and an anticipation for new Merchant's shops feel all great.

[b] + Exploration/Puzzles [/b]
Enough treasures to feel that the exploration is worth it.
Decent puzzles requiring significant brain usage.

[h2] CONS: [/h2]
[b] - Repetitive Encounters [/b]
In the last third of the game I felt burnt out from the sheer amount of enemy encounters you have to deal with. At least it got a bit better near the end thanks to some circumstances and a new enemy type, that is sadly very easily killable once you figure it out.

[b] - No Fear [/b]
The game being more action packed comes at the cost of not inducing the high levels of fear in the player.

[b] - Some Boss Fights [/b]

Basically, it feels like devs got lazy and just made a re-hash of Tomb Raider 2013 with improved textures and better graphics. Every time I play, this game it feels so eerily similar to Tomb Raider 2013 in many respects:  gameplay, super annoying re-spawning enemies who throw weapons/explosives, super-cluttered environment. For some reason, in this chapter of RE, the design/personality of both main characters is insufferable. Ugh.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,209796001,"Coming to this game for the first time in 2025 is a bit weird. Technically it is a bit outdated (and I do not mean graphics, just the overall gameplay, movement, combat etc.). It also isn't very horror-y, more like a whack-em 3rd person action shooter. Enemies are more or less the same throughout the game even though their skins develop. The puzzles are relatively easy and not very elaborate.
I didn't hate it at all but I will probably not be coming back. 

A big plus, compared to RE2, is that playing for Leon vs Ada is really completely different experience and you're not feeling like you're replaying the same thing all over.

Now, almost 15 years later, I wanted to give it another go, and damn, this game is good. The characters and atmosphere are really captivating, and you never notice that this game is actually over 20 years old. This also shows what a good remake this is.

Overall, it's a timeless classic must-play for every horror fan, which also shows that gameplay mechanics for games have stagnated over the last 20 years.

The only point I might criticise is the fact that the craziness of the boss designs and the sense of supernatural abilities or movements in some of the cutscenes for the individual main characters make it clear that this is a Japanese game, and this sense of flawlessness means that some of the enemies can no longer be taken seriously.",True,0,858

They ended up watching me play the entire game. 
While the game wasn't as scary as I thought it'd be It was definitely a lot more enjoyable with someone watching me play it lol.

The game was really enjoyable, the gameplay which was a bit frustrating and annoying at times but most of the time it felt fun and engaging. you never felt like you could thrive and you had just enough to barely get by. 

The story itself was really good too, I loved how its basically one huge map with everything kinda connected to each other.  Leon is really such a lovable character, I love how he is corny and kinda silly sometimes but he also tries to do the right thing even if its not easy and he really cares for [spoiler] Ashley :) [/spoiler] they were really cute together. 

I did really enjoy the game and I am kinda interested in playing other Resident evil games, I at least want to play the other games that Leon is in.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,209595472,"I am here from the original Resident Evil 4 crowd, which I played on the Gamecube religiously - so I cannot say how it will be for new players that never played it. But I think it should be good.

First off I want to say this is exactly how remake should be done. The graphics are excellent, the use of contrast, lighting and shadows provides a constant moody, cinematic feel throughout as does the close-following over-the-shoulder camera. It looks fantastic. But it isn't a remaster like so many developers are cashing in on (because like fuck working for money), it is a full on re-imagining of the game. It's not just quality of life improvements like better controls and character physics, the game has been completely redesigned by today's standards. 

The action is fast paced and requires a lot of finesse. The game encourages you to be constantly moving and very aggressive (like Doom), if you stand in one spot too long or go for defence, you will be taking a one way train to fuck-town. If your hands sweat easily, like mine, then bring some tissues.

The controls feel great. I used keyboard and mouse - I increased camera sensitivity for looking (but not for aiming) so that I can turn the camera quickly without lifting the mouse. I can see what they did with the default control scheme: Q for Quickturn, E for Evade, M for Map, P for Pause - but those latter to are completely unergonomic - M and P are not reachable - remap those to something else. It also uses CTRL for commanding Ashley, again this is really awkward, especially when you use the same key for catching ammo from Luis - but I found remapping to C was perfect for this and doesn't interfere with other defaults. 

The attache case now has auto sorting which really makes it much simpler, but keeps the joy that you can't become overpowered, you gotta pack the right gear and can't get greedy with ammo and healing items. There is a wide assortment of gear keeping the game interesting and encouraging multiple playthroughs as the items are designed to be unique, truly offering a different style of play (unlike the games that give you too many options, but they are all minor stat differences: AABA, ABAA, BAAA etc). There are challenges to complete and new items to unlock. Then there are some new additions such as charms which also tweak certain variables a little, like getting more ammo of a certain type from crafting, selling certain items for more - these are totally optional and add a nice flavour from the old shooting range (which too has been overhauled and improved). 

My main criticism is that enemies do seem to be able to spawn on you or in areas you have just been and were empty. This is discussed - but I am not being paranoid, I had this happen in the Village house when you're with Luis at points where no entry was possible - enemies skipping the ladder and just appearing in a corner choking you. I know they are trying to keep the aggro and intensity up, but I don't like cheap shots. I don't mind enemies spawning in from outside of your accessible environment then walking in and I prefer to have the chance to react first than just getting jumped and choked. 

But overall, the goods far outweigh the negatives in this title, and I am glad I was able to play it.

The graphics are incredible—every environment feels alive, darker, and more detailed, making the horror hit harder. The updated controls and combat are smooth and satisfying, especially the knife mechanics and the improved aiming.

I also really liked how they expanded Leon and Ashley’s interactions. It feels more grounded and emotional without losing the charm of the classic. Some sections were changed, but in a good way—they added new moments that fit perfectly with the story.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,209308955,"[h2] A game I've been hyped to play on my new PC [/h2] 

It's a shame I've tried and tried, but this remake still doesn't convince me. I've completed the game twice; once on Normal difficulty and once on Expert difficulty, but in the end, I was left with nothing. Maybe it's because I've played the original game for so many years, and it feels familiar. I'd also add that I felt like I was playing a Resident Evil that wasn't Resident Evil (hard to explain).

[b] Parrying chainsaws? [/b] 
It's hilarious. The original game wasn't like that. At most, you could shoot crossbow bolts, which was pretty cool for the time. But all that you do with Leon's knife and the knives you find lying around. You also parry incoming axes, or even slashes from sickles and machetes when the ganads are very close. There's this damned parrying mechanic, which many games in recent years seem to have become obsessed with. But that's the way video games are these days, and if developers don't include the parrying mechanic, they're not happy.

[b] ""Remake"" [/b] 
4K, 1080p? Ultra Textures? Graphically, it's very nice, yes, but it's not as exceptional as it seems. In fact, there are some textures on doors and walls that are low-resolution, even when playing at high graphics settings. In terms of lighting and effects, it's also not great, and if you look closely, you can spot the flaws. Like my Leon's face and the low-resolution 2D fire sprites. However, in my first playthrough, I played with AMD Fidelity on Quality mode, while in the second I decided to play without any graphics optimizations. In the end, not much changed. At least I found it well-optimized and never experienced any frame drops even without AMD Fidelity.

[b] Changes in characters, personalities, songs & world [/b]
For a remake, it's primarily a freedom of reinterpretation. There are some characters who, compared to the original version, are anything but themselves. I'm not just referring to their changed appearance, but also, specifically, their personalities. Ashley comes to mind, who was criticized by some for being completely revamped. This new Ashley isn't really Ashley. Ashley was known for being a pain in the ass, and rightfully so. But Capcom listened and took the opportunity to choose a beautiful girl with a confident, non-annoying personality (too perfect). Or different event choices; where Luis Sera [spoiler] dies from a completely random stab from Krauser, whereas in the original game he dies from Saddler's sting [/spoiler]. Let's talk about the game's songs. Serenity was really beautiful in the original version, but she's been completely changed. She's no longer Serenity, but something else now. It always bothered me to save the game and listen to this new version. [u] The only positive things are [/u] that they've at least expanded some areas that weren't there before and added new puzzles. The merchant with this new quest system is nice and gives you rewards. I probably enjoyed Separate Ways more than the base game [spoiler] (although Capcom even went to the trouble of including Ada's random infection in the story).[/spoiler]

[b] Cut Contents in Dialogue [/b]
Capcom has managed to remove and replace 
[strike] ""No Thanks, Bro!"" [/strike] in the first encounter with Salazar and [strike] ""Women"" [/strike] after he's accompanied by Ada to the island. It's probably part of those famous changes. But I think it wasn't necessary. At least they left the Bingo joke in.

[b] Too many useless mini-DLCs [/b]
It disgusted me to see how much useless stuff there is in the Steam Store. Costumes, weapons, weapon mod vouchers, maps, expandable cases, suitcase charms and WTF. And the worst part is that people buy them. In my day, these things were unlocked by finishing the game. It's also absurd to immediately buy charms to make dead enemies drop health, money, and ammo. Otherwise, you can always go to the shooting range and hope for the right charm with tokens (but you're not guaranteed to be lucky).

[u] In conclusion [/u]
This remake is truly soulless. I'll continue to prefer the 2005 original on PS2 (which I proudly own in physical form) and the HD collection on PC, which I have 100% of all the achievements.

[b] PS:  [/b] In the end, tastes are tastes. I didn't say it was crap. I just said I didn't like it as a remake. The only remakes I liked were Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake (even though everyone hated the latter).",False,2,5094

Resident Evil 4,2050650,209175562,"You have to handle a 1v?? shootout in a crowded village where a sprinting chainsaw who is wearing a hooded muscleman eventually shows up. That's the base level of skill needed to deal with the next major areas in the game. At first I thought this was a really hard task, but after a few tries I cleared this first area easily, the control scheme and how movement works while sprinting, walking, and aiming, took some getting used to. I also had a hard time understanding which methods you're supposed to be using in a fight, there's a lot of cool tools and abilities and I didn't know if I was even playing correctly. After a few hours I got very good at the game and the most important thing is what you learn next.

He is an un-killable chainsaw wearing a man, but actually if you shoot the man enough, he will die. I didn't try shooting the chainsaw that much on account of the fact that I love chainsaws. Everything dies if you attack it enough, but enemies have areas you can hit to stall them and land some combos. Your ability to aim at heads, arms, legs, and the weapon the enemy has is important, and each do different things. If it's a non-humanoid, you need to come up with ways to deal with their unique weak points. No matter what it is, when you stun an enemy you usually always have the option to do a melee finisher that sends them into more stun for you to shoot them or it kills them. This game is mostly controlling distance, the area between you and an enemy. Each weapon specializes in different distances, once you learn these you can handle many threats. A problem for you to overcome is you earn different weapons over a fair period of time and you need to have ammo for your weapons, sometimes you may be fighting at a disadvantage, but pushing through it and winning those battles feels amazing, and earning more powerful weapons for the harder ones is awesome.

The 90's action movie plus eldritch horror monster residenciness of this game is amazing, and the progression between settings that look like they are from different games yet somehow all exist in this one will wow you. The characters are honest, straightforward, and feel incredibly capable of doing the things they are doing. I highly recommend it, and if you love it get the Seperate Ways DLC which takes place from Ada's perspective. The Mercenaries mode is an Arcade Shooter variant of the game's general game loop which is fun for a while, the game suggests you complete the game before trying it and this is because it makes use of all your skill progression up until near the end of the game.

I love this game! I am going to watch videos of the OG Resident Evil 4 to see the differences and similarities between the two games, and why the original has such a positive reputation.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,209165080,"“A Field Trip Through Chaos, Parasites, and One Extremely Supportive Arms Dealer”

Resident Evil 4 is the only game where you can politely walk into a remote European village and immediately get greeted with:
“Hello! We’d like to kill you with farm equipment!”
Five stars. Authentic cultural experience.

The remake looks incredible. Almost too incredible. Every time a Ganado sprints at me with that fast-walk-your-grandma-does-when-she’s-angry energy, I genuinely feel like I need to file a complaint with someone. Possibly HR. Possibly a priest.

Combat is a beautiful disaster. You’re constantly choosing between reloading, running, screaming, or all three at once. Every time I miss a headshot, I can hear the developers giggling somewhere. Knifing enemies feels amazing though—like slapping chaos back into order with nothing but spite and steel.

Ashley is actually competent now, which is great, but she also has the gravitational pull of a missing-person poster. Everyone wants to kidnap her. Everyone. I escort her for five minutes and suddenly she’s gone again like a cat that heard a plastic bag crinkle in another room.

The environments are a mix of “wow, what stunning architecture” and “wow, what a suspicious number of murder holes.” Every hallway feels like it was designed by someone whose favorite hobby is “watching tourists suffer.” Barrels explode. Floors collapse. Ceilings drop spiky things. Even the fish in the lake are mad at you.

And then…
The Merchant.
A man. A myth. A walking Craigslist ad with eldritch teleportation powers.

This guy shows up EVERYWHERE. I once turned a corner after barely surviving a mob, and there he was like:

“Stranger… you look like you’ve been mauled by God Himself. Wanna buy a rocket launcher?”

He is your emotional support weapons dealer.

He stands in caves, castles, swamps, air vents, probably the afterlife—just waiting, watching, plotting inventory expansions. I’m 90% sure the Ganados don’t attack him because they think he’s some kind of forest deity who sells guns and vibes.

He never explains how he travels. He never explains why he likes you. He never explains what’s under that mask. Honestly? I don’t want the answers. I want the mystery. I want the romance of being hunted by parasites but supported by a man whose pockets contain seventeen firearms and one singular, precious “HREEHH-HREEHH-HREEHH” laugh.

The Merchant’s shop is the only place in the entire game where I feel like my blood pressure drops below “volcano.” For 30 blissful seconds, it’s just me, my attaché case, and the knowledge that I’m bad at spatial organization despite having two hands and a brain.

If he ever stops appearing, Leon will break down emotionally, and so will I.

The story is a perfect roller coaster: dramatic, horrifying, absurd, and sprinkled with enough Leon Kennedy sarcasm to clean up an oil spill. Every chapter ends with me asking myself, “Why am I still here?” followed immediately by, “One more.”",True,0,1140

RE4R is the finale in the initial run of the REmake trilogy, just like my other reviews I'll try to be quick and snappy with how this game improves over the original and how they kept good faith with the community after the confusing predicament they had with RE3. 

Likes:
-RE4R's color palette marks an end to the iconic, albeit kinda jarring brown and dark light filters and color palettes that gave the original its atmosphere. But I think it was an improvement to mark this as a full on remake, the game is inherently the same in terms of plot, enemies, and general mechanics. This works in the games favor overall I think and keeps the atmosphere of all the remakes to keep an aura of consistency with the new narrative while also paying tribute to the original titles. 

-God damn do the guns feel good in this game, every bullet fired from a variety of the guns carries weight and feels powerful to account for how many enemies Leon and Ada face across the village, castle, and island. This was really important to nail, considering you spend most of the game in combat and ammo is scarce, but with the crafting system, you could always be somewhat prepared for an encounter before it happens. I think how the remake handled the case and the crafting system is also very strong by allowing a lot more customization to your loadout as well as the charms handing out boons with small buffs to aid Leon and Ada’s journey to Saddler. 

-Enemy variety is very strong in this game compared to 2 and subsequently 3, while 3 had a lot of different enemy types, the way that each of them were engaged was nothing short of “pump it full of lead till it dies.” But in 4 there has to be an active focus with each enemy whether it’s a basic Ganado or a juiced up Regenarador ready to pump you full of needles, I still saw myself thinking about the tools in my kit and how to use them. Stingray my absolute beloved, you saved me from so many of those lanky regenerating sacks of meat. This was a highlight in 2 as well, but to a lesser degree, but for how active combat is in this game, it shines really well. 

-The story while essentially a retelling, this game breathed life into Ashley that she sorely needed from the original. While the sections with her are certainly the same level of stress as the original, when gameplay is handed over to her, she’s a very capable secondary protagonist. I think this works really well in the games favor and makes her feel more like a partner and less an asset you need to drag around and hold you back. And when you take down saddler, I felt even better that all of Leon, Ada, and Ashley’s work all paid off. 

-Seperate ways was a very strong DLC that told Ada’s side of the story, I was not expecting iy to pay attention to detail as much as it did, as well as, the length being more than I bargained for. I think this DLC does a really good job of characterizing the REmake Ada into a woman who is confused and wrestles with her own emotions while essentially helping blonde Satan. I’m very happy to see how she’s characterized this way, as I believe the original almost left us with too little characterization of why Ada functions the way she does. 

-The merchant. Need I say anything else? THEY GAVE US MORE, I CAN’T EXPLAIN IT ANY BETTER, JUST MORE OF HIM AND ITS GREAT!


Dislike:
-The game is a wee bit long for me but that’s a personal gripe. 

-The economy in this game is pretty saturated with a large bag of goodies, but I think the fact that we find so many weapons as the characters journey across Saddlers expansive settlement, that I kinda lost the fear midway through. I saw myself strategizing more often instead of actually paying attention to the horrors in front of me, this is a bad thing in my opinion considering that the original reason why RE almost died was it lost the horror. I don’t mind action horror, but the horror needs to be there past BOWs and heavily mutated Ganados, Capcom please, with RE5 and 6, don’t go back to action. 

-While all of the boss fights played out relatively cleanly and well paced, the sheer number of boss fights in this game contributed to a lot of the length. Again, this might just be a me thing considering I associate RE with selective choices of boss fights in style, I felt similar to 3, this game was setting up set pieces and less trying to show me the horror of it all. It’s not wrong to make me feel like a badass, but the horror got diluted as a result. 

Overall, RE4R is a clean, crisp, and fun action horror game that stands the test of time with the original. From seeing the priest in the village to fighting a demigod of a man known as Saddler, Leon, Ashley, and Ada shined in this game as characters. I praise the game for its bizarre nature and fun mechanics. I feel like towards the end, it crashes and burns trying to set up set pieces rather than giving me the emotion, fear, and dread that previous entries provided. 

Gonna give it a crisp 8.5/10, I might platinum this one if an apocalypse happens, but it’s a journey and a half.

This game has a pretty severe CPU bottleneck problem. Even my high-end rig still gets annoying stutters. Also, the default image quality (TAA/FSR2) is bad, in my opinion. It causes a lot of shimmering artifacts everywhere and the picture just looks soft/blurry.

IMPORTANT ADVICE:
As soon as you start the game, immediately TURN OFF 'Hair Strands' and 'Ray Tracing'. These two settings are completely unoptimized. They tank your FPS for almost zero visual gain.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,208850454,".....What else can I say what hasn't already been said?

This is Resident Evil 4. 

A remake of one of the best, most influential games of all time. Without the original RE4, we wouldn't have Gears of War, Mass Effect, Uncharted, Dead Space along with so many other third person shooters.
I would argue that the original RE4 was nearly as influential as the original Doom games were,

The original RE4 was a legendary game without a shadow of a doubt, even with the tank controls it was known for which gave it a very distinctive and recognizable feel whenever you played it.

Does RE4R bring the magic of the original RE4 to the modern age? Yes, it absolutely does in my opinion. With a few caveats.

First of all, Resident Evil's gameplay has never been better in RE4R. I'm serious. The gameplay is as close to perfect as it needed to be, even though it got rid of the tank controls (and most quick time events) of the original RE4. So, that distinctive feel of original RE4 really isn't there anymore, it feels much more contemporary here. Plays more like a hastened Resident Evil 2. However, the act of gunning down a couple ganados, running from a chainsaw guy, being cornered and gorily blowing the chainsaw guy away (along with 5+ other ganados) with a blast or two of your trusty pump-action shotgun has never felt better. The gore is outstanding too. You can sever enemies clean in half with a single trigger pull of a shotgun or a magnum revolver or a grenade. You can shoot ganado's arms off in order to prevent them from swinging their axes at you. There is so much strategy to think about while you are deep in the fray with dwindling ammunition reserves. You need to make every shot count, use every bullet to it's maximum potential. Line up your rifle shots and blow apart 5+ enemy heads in a row. Take aim and fire at the red barrels while here are enemies crowding around it. Parry an onslaught of enemy attacks and roundhouse kick the nearest ganado off the nearest cliffside. Shoot lanterns as ganados walk underneath them. Shoot a ganado's hand holding a molotov or a stick of dynamite and make it blow up in their face. So many options to use mid combat. So many ways to have fun. RE4R feels less like a horror game and more like an late 90s action movie with a horror theme. It's fantastic. Honestly in my top 10 combat systems of all time. Maybe top 5 even. 

Oh, and the environments are incredibly strong as well. Not nearly as good as RE Village's environments but they are still very well done.

The only issue that I have with the gameplay is the weapon bloom. In original RE4, weapons were literally pin point accurate. Even the SMGs. The shotguns are the only weapons in the original RE4 that weren't highly accurate from what I remember. RE4R does away with this and gives every single gun weapon bloom whenever you shoot them, making you miss more shots the more you pull the trigger. 
I fully emphasize that the gunplay feels INCREDIBLE during the main campaign and Separate Ways, but it does get frustrating when you are trying to do the pirate themed shooting gallery that the merchant sometimes hosts during your spooky adventure. Most of the weapons have their own little shooting gallery for you to practice in, and for your reward, you get these gold or silver coins for you to buy charms with. The higher the score and the more targets you hit in the lowet amount of time, th emore of these coins you will get. These shooting gallery sections feel excellent in the original RE4 because every weapon didn't have weapon bloom. You can unload your SMG as often as you want and it would hit the mark every single time. In RE4R's shooting galleries, in order for you to fully complete one, you have to specifically target these skull weakpoints placed on the pirate targets. The weapon bloom in RE4R makes this feel really diffficult to do so, especially during the shooting galleries that have you using an SMG. Instead of specifically targeting a skull with the SMG like in OG RE4, you are mostly just tapping the fire button and HOPING you don't get completely screwed over by weapon bloom in RE4R. Gets incredibly annoying. You won't think about this very much until you really start trying to 100% the shooting galleries.

Another thing that annoyed me in RE4R is the UI design and atmosphere. The UI design itself is fine, great even, the problem is the aesthetics. It looks way, WAY too clean. The grimy but interesting UI design of OG RE4 is gone in favor of something more contemporary and not as unique. The sections in OG RE4 where Leon is speaking with Hunnigan (and all of the other characters) through comms? Those are gone in RE4, all being expressed through a small video in the lower half of the screen whenever it does happen. 
The OG RE4 also has a very dense, intense, dreamy atmosphere to it, almost Silent Hill esque. Slightly foggy environment and film grain. Very gritty. RE4R doesn't have that which does disappoint me. Environments are too clear. RE4R's music isn't nearly as strong as og RE4's as well. Serenity is gone entirely. :(

One more thing I should talk about is the characterization and voice acting. RE4R adds a LOT to Leon, Ashley and Luis. Leon is no longer a corny sarcastic joker, he's now suffering from PTSD (from RE2's events) and uses humor to keep himself sane. Ashley is no longer just an annoying NPC you escort, she actually develops a relationship with Leon as the events of the game play out. Luis is no longer a spanish womanizer, he actually has a really good reason to be part of the story now. So, RE4R does great charecterization for the protagonists, at the cost of the villains. Saddler is no longer interesting as he was before, he's just a big bad villain with no nuance anymore. It's a 1 step forward, 1 step backward kind of deal.

And now, the voice acting. It's generally great. It's several steps ahead of OG RE4. Until you listen to Ada. And, look, she has never looked better in Resident Evil games prior. Visually, she is at her best in RE4R. ....But then you listen to her voice. Her voice acting is terrible, like a wine mom is recording her lines in the closet. Practically Ride to Hell Retribution levels of bad voice acting. On top of that, her lines from the original RE4 have been rewritten. So, as an example, Ada no longer says ""I don't kiss and tell"" towards Leon, she says ""I don't work and tell"", which makes the voice acting feel even more grating. And then you have an entire separate campaign with her as the main protagonist? I mean, Separate Ways was fantastic, but MY GOD Ada's voice acting is atrocious. 6 hours of constant ""work and tell"" dialogue. Bring back Jolene Andersen, Capcom. Jolene did a fantastic job as Ada in Resident Evil 2 and you decided it would be best to replace her? You almost had the perfect Ada. Yikes. Brilliant decision making there, Capcom. Almost as brilliant as the time you rushed out Dragon's Dogma 2 like 2 years too early..

To wrap things up, I thought RE4R was one of the best games I've ever played. It's nearly perfect from a gameplay perspective and gives a lot of much needed improvements even though it doesn't stay close enough to the original RE4 as I would like.

You will have a fantastic time with it. 

And, please, greet those Regeneradors with a magnum round to the dome for me. I don't care if 'it's a waste of ammunition', they deserve it.

Goodness gracious. I really, really want RE5 and RE6 remakes.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,208786989,"In order to understand what went fundamentally wrong with RE4make we should first briefly revisit what defined the original and what it’s remembered and still played for.

The original back in 2005 was revolutionary - it established the third person shooter genre and redefined the survival horror one. It placed a particular emphasis on combat, with an integral part of that being tactical and responsive gunplay. Every weapon had an identity and shooting any part of an enemy came with distinct advantages - whether slowing them down, disarming them or blowing up lit dynamite, taking out their allies in the process. Loot and ammo dropping from every enemy and even crows and chicken encouraged you - for the very first time in Resident Evil franchise - to engage with combat mechanics instead of avoiding combat to conserve ammunition, as it was customary for the classic games.

Meanwhile RE4make reuses the combat system from the remake of Resident Evil 2. The slow and methodical gunplay that makes you wait for the reticle to close after every shot; the punishing spread and recoil that discourages firing a submachine gun other than in short bursts; the bullet-spongy enemies that barely even flinch and make it feel like your guns are shooting blanks; the comically overpowered yet ever-breaking knives leaving you defenceless - all that worked well in RE2, portraying the character as vulnerable and presenting even a single zombie as a real threat, encouraging the player to avoid combat rather than engage in it.

Needless to say, it doesn’t work here. As a result, the remake plays like RE2 with decorations from RE4. This weird mixture of different concepts creates a game that doesn’t know what it wants from you - to engage in inconsistent, unfair and unfun combat with little room for tactical gunplay, the enemies that will stunlock you while attacking relentlessly and a knife that’s better than a rocket launcher; or to remove your gear and force you to make use of its new feature, the stealth mechanics. The latter is an afterthought that achieves nothing other than to break the pacing of the game and take away from its combat focus. The 2005 revolution has not been improved upon, but instead was treated as if never happened. The laser sight - arguably one of the original’s most notable additions to combat - while technically still present as a side quest reward you need to grind for, can now only be attached to a couple of weaker pistols.

As far as the story and atmosphere are concerned, the original is best characterized as an unpretentious B-movie. It was full of cheesy one-liners, silly dialogues and goofy fan service “features”, like looking up Ashley’s skirt. The game was very self-aware and did everything to prevent you from treating itself too seriously. It did not really try to be a horror either - acknowledging the fact that when a game gives you a machine gun, the only thing you can be scared of is running out of ammo. As a whole, it all worked well to give the original its unique vibe and identity.

The remake, however, goes out of its way to present itself as dead serious. The surroundings and ambience try their best to create a dark, ominous atmosphere. Unnecessary and excessive even by RE standards graphical violence in your face including mutilated corpses and elaborate death animations as well as an annoying mandatory horror segment make it feel like a love letter to Village instead of the original. There’s no longer much room for based light-hearted comedy in this new game, and drastic changes to characters and dialogues are emblematic of that. The feminine “damsel in distress” Ashley is gone - replaced by a cringe “strong and independent” Ashley instead. The president did not equip his daughter with ballistics this time round, while a modern take on Ashley’s lingerie with 4k textures, ray tracing, DLSS and HDR is obviously out of discussion. She now calls herself “master of unlocking”, no longer offers Leon “overtime” and (following in RE3make’s footsteps) wears an ugly skort. Ada’s red dress was likewise taken away from her in favour of a sweater. Hunnigan is now overly professional rather than casual and flirty. And Leon is now suffering from PTSD one minute and spitting one-liners the next one - unsure of his role in this brave new world. Of course, they did not stop at the tone and character design: the game no longer features many dialogues, a number of areas, weapons and bosses, nor any of the additional content RE4 used to have.

As a result, in RE4make the overly serious vibe strangely coexists with the few remaining one-liners and ridiculous enemies like a giant fish. It comes across as a game “gone woke” and somehow manages to be even less faithful to the original than the remake of RE3 - which, to be fair, at least preserved the tone and spirit of its namesake. The things that made the original so fun are just not here anymore, being “reimagined”, censored or sterilized. In fact, RE4make feels like a completely different game that just so happens to share a bunch of names with the original.

Is this different game at least great as far as modern games are concerned? Unfortunately, this is not the case either. There is nothing here that would bring novelty to the genre or, indeed, even justify the existence of this remake. The only additions to the usual formula are side quests (boring busywork tasks with little variety like “kill 3 rats” and “shoot 6 medallions”) and lootboxes giving you rare and epic charms to boost your stats. The unsatisfying and inconsistent gunplay does not belong here and is not fit for purpose. Continuing the trend set by RE3make level design is full of cramped, claustrophobic corridors as if created to work around PS1-era hardware limitations. The voice acting is sad and uninspired, oftentimes missing its “acting” part. The level of self-plagiarism here is staggering, evident of creative stagnation in the absence of great minds like Shinji Mikami: if you played RE2 Remake or Village (ironically, itself a derivative of RE4) - you pretty much played this one as well.

Of course, a review should not only be concerned with the question of how good the game is, but also how good it is for the asking price. And I see two problems here. First of all, it’s priced $60 - higher than any of Capcom’s previous remakes. And frankly, it’s a big ask considering there’s no additional content. The second, arguably even bigger issue is the nonexistent regional pricing. For example, as a Ukrainian gamer as of time of this review I can get Cyberpunk for $25, and Hogwarts Legacy for mere $20. Meanwhile Capcom expected me to pay some $55 - about full price.

I’d also like to mention what I can only describe as aggressive monetization. You see, the progression once again follows the RE3R formula - the higher levels of difficulty are simply brutal and are envisioned to be tackled not as much with skill but rather overpowered weaponry from previous runs (Professional is clearly balanced around infinite rocket launcher). Preorder bonus trinkets actually give you gameplay advantages like more gold and ammo crafted, effectively making Hardcore difficulty not-so-hardcore. Meanwhile Deluxe Edition adds treasures that simply don’t exist in the game otherwise as well as guns that are all-round better than those you can find in the beginning - and you can now even upgrade them! It all feels very pay-to-win in a singleplayer game. I imagine RE4make was designed as a cash cow and will get All Rewards Unlocked and many other DLC in the future.

TL;DR: RE2make and Village had a baby, allowed it to pick its gender and gave it a famous name just because. It is not another revolution for the genre - it’s merely a corridor shooter with yellow paint of handholding everywhere. Hard skip if you’re a fan of the original, grab on sale if you couldn’t get enough of Capcom’s recent games on RE Engine and wanted more of the same.",False,8,2166

The game has a lot of back-tracking if you want to complete for spigels or special requests, but the gameplay and storyline itself were very fun.

I got in situations many times where I kept dying, so I tried something different, etc. And I got better at surviving, using my surroundings to kill the enemies, and progress through the game. Although I admit I did look up at some help from youtube as I got stuck a couple times,. but for the most part I completed the game just from playthrough.

I'm looking forward to the following future series of RE. I got this game on sale, so now I understand why it's hyped up. RE0 and RE1, were too hard for me and the camera angles sucked imo. The new RE series are a lot better with the camera angles and graphics.",True,0,1175

Gameplay-wise, the mechanics are smooth and modernized without losing that classic RE4 charm. Combat feels satisfying, weapons handle great, and the pacing keeps things exciting. The balance between action and survival horror is just right.

The bosses are absolutely amazing to fight, each appearing naturally as you progress, and every encounter feels satisfying. There’s a ton of action, and the combat system is easily the most enjoyable in the series — fluid, intense, and rewarding.

I also loved that the puzzles are fewer, simpler, and can be solved right where you find them — no need to run around the map just to complete one. The characters are great, and the DLC featuring Ada adds a really nice touch to her character and the overall story.

The upgrade system and the shop are fantastic additions too — they make you feel stronger and really help you enjoy the gameplay even more.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,208551337,"This game is the diamond of the Resident Evil universe.
(I haven’t played RE7, RE8, or the original RE4 yet.)

We can definitely say Leon was in his prime here. And Ada? Dayummm, she is something else.

Story:

The story is really good, and the best part — the game never feels slow.
The pacing is fast, engaging, and you never feel bored (at least I never did).
The way the DLC story runs parallel to the main story was a nice touch.
However, the DLC feels a bit rushed compared to the main campaign.

Combat:

Combat is next-level and a massive upgrade compared to RE2 and RE3.
Not only can you dodge, but now you can also counter and attack with style.
There’s even a stealth option and some wrestling moves.
My favorite has to be the [spoiler]knife combat — parrying is so satisfying here, it almost feels like Sekiro.[/spoiler]
Absolutely loved it.

Enemies:

Enemies are very diverse — [spoiler]from village mobs to castle freaks to island soldiers.[/spoiler]
My personal favorite is [spoiler]Chainsaw Guy[/spoiler] — I just love parrying his attacks.
Bosses are cool and sometimes genuinely scary, especially that [spoiler]El Gigante.[/spoiler]
The fight with [spoiler]Krauser was absolutely epic, easily one of my favorites since it’s pure knife combat.[/spoiler]
The final fight was total chaos — exactly what I was hoping for.

Characters:

Leon: The GOAT of Resident Evil, no doubt.

Ada: She’s mine. Leon can take Claire and continue the Redfield bloodline 😏

Ashley: Surprisingly great character — someone you’d genuinely want to protect.

Luis: Have to say, [spoiler]his death made me a little emotional.[/spoiler] Amazing character.

Krauser:[spoiler]Nice villain, loved his fight.[/spoiler]

Wesker: [spoiler]He can only spare 7 minutes, lmao.[/spoiler]

Special Mentions:
[spoiler]The helicopter guy[/spoiler] — absolute legend, saved me so many times on the island.||
And of course, the [spoiler]Merchant[/spoiler]— “What’re ya buyin’, stranger?” never gets old.

Overall:

This game is amazing and maybe my best Resident Evil experience so far.
I still have to play RE7 and RE8, but let’s see if they can top this one.
RE4 Remake is an absolute banger.

Not a 1:1 recreation, so it doesn't outright replace the original game, but all the new mechanics and redesigned rooms and fights flow together incredibly well. I really enjoyed the improved Ashley section, all the new enemies as well as the added side quests. Parrying took some getting used to but it's smooth and feels good to perform. Regenerators still make me shit my pants. Insanely replayable both because of how fun the game is to just sit down and play and because it has a lot of fun extra content, such as different challenge runs you can do that unlock different rewards or the expanded upon Mercenaries mode. Can be quite challenging on higher difficulties. As for the negatives despite loving it's DLC, Seperate Ways as well, I'm not huge on how certain parts of the game were cut in order to be resold as DLC and selling all the weapon upgrade tickets feels kinda scummy. Anyway, still a great game that's worth the money, especially since it goes on sale pretty regularly at this point. But even at full price there's a lot to love about this one.",True,1,7855

Resident Evil 4,2050650,208183139,"Capcom faced significant pressure in reimagining what many consider to be the best game in the Resident Evil series. The previous installments, Resident Evil 7 and Village, received mixed reviews, and fans were disappointed with the Resident Evil 3 remake. As a result, Resident Evil 4 had big shoes to fill to impress both veterans and newcomers.

I originally played RE4 on my PS4 but completed a second run, along with the ‘Separate Ways’ DLC, on PC. Capcom nailed this remake with its fresh take on the story and advanced combat system.

While the story remained largely the same, there were a few rushed story beats; however, the characters retained their essence from the original. There has been some debate about whether the original characters were better, which I agree with, but I also enjoyed the new talent. This time around, I appreciated the latest portrayal of Ashley, who actively cheers on Leon in the shooting range, expresses her concerns about situations, and reacts to the action rather than just shouting “Help!” Luis, in my opinion, stole the show. He was the best character adapted in this remake, especially with his ‘Don Quixote’ references.

The new combat system in RE4 felt very smooth. Capcom’s improved AI forces players to adopt a run-and-gun approach rather than staying in one spot. It took me a while to adjust, but I understand that Capcom aimed to avoid the stiff playstyle of the previous game. The parry system was a nice addition, especially since enemies rush toward you. Stealth also plays a crucial role in certain situations, allowing players to conserve resources. However, the bosses were challenging and at times quite aggravating when trying to dodge their attacks.

So far, this game has the best combat in the series thus far; hopefully, future titles can adopt.

Overall, the Resident Evil 4 Remake is a must-have for any fan of the series. I’m excited to see what remake Capcom will take on next. I give it a 9/10.",True,0,2801

Resident Evil 4,2050650,208066658,"Resident Evil 4 is really really good and probably the best resident evil game out there right now at least in gameplay. 

Capcom basically took everything that worked so well in Resident Evil 2 & 7, dialed up the action and gameplay by 10 while still managing to keep the iconic horror this franchise is known for. They have successfully struck the perfect balance between action packed power fantasy gameplay, and  iconic resident evil horror. This is something most studios can't achieve, yet Capcom not only did it, but also perfected it in this game.

The cut scenes, the environments, the art direction, the carefully designed details on every surface, it's all done with such surgical perfection and it's only further enhanced by the buttery smooth optimisation of this game. No stutters, No frame rate drops, not even a single bug to encountered in my entire 30 hour playthrough. Every section, level, terrain, item and location not only looks gorgeous, but plays perfectly and just like how it's supposed to. I cannot commend the people behind this engine and games enough. Truly talented tech geniuses and its their innovation that set the ground work for what has made this franchise ascend into god tier quality.

What makes this game stand out so much though is the gameplay. Third-person Blood-curdling action packed linear levels with satisfying gun play that is only further enhanced by Capcom's insane sound design. Every foot step, every gun shot, even something as small as the sound of pages turning is so detailed. When you shoot someone in the head, you feel the impact of the bullet from the sound of skin tearing and blood splatter. When you round house kick, you feel the heavy impact of leon's foot on the enemies neck from the sound of it snapping and cracking. It really brings this game to life. It is truly a technical marvel and i swear no one in this industry does sound as good as capcom does.

Its all further enhanced by the variety of weapons & upgrades in this game. There's enough here to keep a healthy level of flexibility in how you want to play. The progression system in how you upgrade your weapons is also incorporated into exploration, making it always feel rewarding and worth while. The enemies follow suit in quality, ranging from your classic terrifying big monster with dodge mechanics to a slippery assassin scorpion that intelligently uses the environment to sneak up and attack you. Many also have little twists and details that really enrich the way you can approach enemies. Villagers that hold C4's in their hand that you can shoot to blow them and their surroundings up. Infected with regenerative abilities that you need to shoot specific weak spots to kill. It's this rich variety in how you interact with the game that makes the moment to moment experience always feel new. It is what makes this franchise so iconically endlessly replayable.

The story is about what you'd expect from a capcom resident evil game. Nothing insane in narrative, but just enough lore dressing and interesting connections to umbrella to keep fans like me interested in the characters of this game and the world their in. What surprised me the most though is how hilarious the writing is. Leons dialogue in particular. It's bordering Devil may cry 5 levels of ironic but still being grounded enough to feel serious. I think the execution is the real MVP here as it's done well enough to make Leon's silly 2010 esq comments come off as charming and lovable rather than cringe and annoying. The writing really is a product of its time and i'm so happy Capcom did not touch it in this remake because i really love it.

Generally speaking, this extreme of a departure in any franchise, let alone one with horror as iconic as Resident Evil's, usually turns out to be a disappointment. But Capcom really stuck the landing here. They managed to create a satisfying action focused game whilst still having it feel like resident evil. They did it so well, infact, i might prefer this style over RE 2&7's more slow placed horror, as long as it's done well. 

And this game certainly does it extremely well. Which is why I highly recommend it.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,207942510,"The fact that Capcom took one of their most beloved games and improved on it so much in almost every single way not only speaks of great mastery, but also of great respect towards the original RE4. The remake improves and extends on the combat, level design, level navigation, lore, side-quests, rewards and progression system while keeping the soul of the original game, which in current setting looks to be an insurmountable task for many. Quite a few modern remakes/remasters just reimplement the exact same mechanics while only giving the game a new coat of paint and not improving on it whatsoever (eg: Demon's Souls, Dead Space, Metroid Prime, Metal Gear Solid 3 or Oblivion...). The game also removes some fat from the original, which I understand though removing a particular boss and moving to the DLC I've found kinda weird. 
The original game absolutely deserves a lot of recognition and respect with how much it influenced many 3rd person action games, but looking at it objectively, it has a couple of issues, which this remake addresses, creating a game that easily surpasses the original.",True,1,2932

Resident Evil 4,2050650,207904706,"I want to start off with the positives. I love the fight mechanics. Being able to duck, parry and move more freely during combat makes every fight a lot more enticing, and I find myself more drawn in. The visuals are also extremely beautiful. I first played it on PS5, and with a TV screen, it's like a movie.

BUT, what I don't like, is the extremely wild difficulty range. When I perform too well in a few mini-bosses, the game punishes me in the long run, by turning everything 10x harder. I didn't mind, until I got to ""house guarding"" with Luis. I died there 6 times, until the game decided to go easier on me. And I wouldn't have minded the difficulty if LEON WASN'T SO HARD TO CONTROL. Most boss battles happen in tight places, which I find so stupid. Leon runs like a grandma, turns around like a tank, but somehow is fast enough to catch every punch coming his way?? I have clips in which at least 4 ganados decided to take turns playing punchbag on Leon, not even giving a chance for him to get up.
Which brings me to my 2nd point. We have the mechanic to parry any weapon, heck, sometimes even punches, so obviously they needed to introduce something else to keep us on our toes.. oh, right, EMPTY HANDED GANADOS. They pose the biggest threat in a mass shooting, solely because they can hold you down, and flip you out from your strategies. It gets annoying fast.
However, what's even more annoying is [b]Leon.[/b] I adoreee the old cocky Leon from the og, and I understand the remake wanted a more serious tone, but god are some of his lines straight up embarrassing. When he finally reached Ashley and murmured ""huh, that went well"" I had to pause the game for a moment.

anywayy, I have a strange relationship with this game, I like it and hate it at the same time, but if i had to recommend it, i wouldn't :D",False,3,561

The combat is the best in the series, the boss fights and enimes are tough but great, the gameplay is fantastic and the story for what its worth had a strong emotional weight to it.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,207848093,"RE4 is a modern classic in every sense. Not only is it an excellent survival horror, it is also probably the best action narrative game on the market. Everything from the level design, weapons and gameplay are polished and well executed. You would be hard pressed to find better 3rd person gameplay or a more robust roster of enemies to face. 
It isn't perfect, I do have some issues with the constant changes in setting, particularly the island portion in the final act, but the village and the castle are rich in a gothic european atmosphere. The story is also solid, much more an early 2000's action adventure than a horror story, but for the game RE4 is, I think it fits. 
Overall its hard to levy any real criticism at RE4 as I seem to enjoy it more and more with every playthrough. It is likely a game I will continue to replay for years to come.",True,2,4988

Luis & Ada? Absolutely flawless.
Ashley — annoying as ever (especially when she runs in front of you when your sniping 😒).

How does a gamecube game from 2005 feel snappier and more dynamic then a modern action game by the same company?
A game where you stand still to shoot? They had a lot of room to expand and broaden Leon's move set and they chose to...make him harder to control. That and strange choices where I'm watching Leon do things when before it was the player doing it....I dunno man, this ain't it.",False,8,49

The horror is there, surprise is there, RE OG shooting mechanics and camera angles are there, cutscenes are interesting, lovely melee attacks and parrying with knife (you can feel the pressure at each fight and the force of which Leon kicks every time), I love the small changes like the dialogue between characters that's slightly different than the 2004 version, and the game really shows it's value again with this remake after so many years.

This is the third story game I've played. It's extremely fun, the atmosphere sort of changes throughout the gameplay.
I felt in three different areas while playing this. The first one was Chapters 1-6 where it was a village-y/mystical vibe. Chapters 7-12 were medieval/Witcher 3 (lol) vibe. Chapters 13-16 had a futuristic/mechanical type of vibe, kinda hard to explain, but I loved every single one of the chapters.
The villains were insanely interesting, even the chainsaw guy in chapters 1-4 (I think), was hella fun to play around with lol. Birores Mendez was my favorite, he was ominous and had a clear motive - get Ashley and eradicate everything that gets in it's way - didn't work so well though haha.
There was a debate going on the medias - which is better - Silent Hill 2 remake or Resident Evil 4 remake? I've read some reviews and some ideas and I definitely agree with most of them. Silent Hill 2 remake is a dark, ominous, mysterious, psychological-horror with some hidden messages, while Resident Evil 4 remake is an arcade type of game with lots of action, guns and grehnayyyyydes. Both are amazing works, but I must say, I found RE4R much more fun. Definitely recommending RE4R fans to check out SH2R though.
By the way, I'd be thinking when lessons would end, just so I could come home and play RE4R...
Anyways, my rating of this game would have to be a 9/10. Not a 10/10, just 'cause the presumably ""strongest"" boss battles were simple.. I'd say I had more work fighting off the minions, rather than the bosses themselves. I wanted to sweat a lil.. 🥀💔

You can replay it over and over and it still doesn’t get old. Each difficulty hits different and gives you a real challenge.

Leon’s changed a lot since RE2. He is more confident, more badass. Ashley isn’t annoying anymore unlike her OG counterpart, and Ada? Total girlboss as always. Stylish, cool, deadly. And Wesker… oh man... Wesker is awesome. He is THAT guy. The best villain in RE franchise. I seriously can’t wait for a RE5 remake just to see him again.

Enemy designs are top-tier, both in the main game and in the Separate Ways DLC. Every boss fight feels unique, and the Regenerators? Easily the creepiest things in the whole game. Those freaks are freaky ;)

Took me almost a month to finish everything.  Got all of the achievements and messed around in Mercenaries. Didn’t bother with the records though, no way I’m doing that grind. Still, I feel like I’ve done it all and it’s been an amazing ride.

Big thanks to Capcom for this masterpiece. For those reading this, Resident Evil 4 Remake is absolutely worth your time. Can’t wait to see what’s next! Hopefully RE5 or Code Veronica will have its own remake.

There are certain sections like the Mine Cart sections that are so fun that you want to play them again and again. I especially like the sections where there are a lot of enemies where you have to carefully conserve ammo and take them down. The game strikes a perfect balance between horror and action  which scratches a very specific itch unlike the games later in the series.

Re4 is the best remake and one of the best linear games in games history .

The game is complete in all aspects: 

1- A interesting and enjoyable gameplay, with the role of the knife being made more important.

 2- Re-formulating the story in a modern way and making it more exciting. 

3-Excellent graphic level.

4- Many, wonderful things such as merchant requests and collecting treasures.

Granted I had played RE2 remake before this, but that game scared me too much, no lie. Completing it was a slog, but I did enjoy it royally, but this game takes the cake for me. Because of this game, I will be completing RE7 and RE8 in preperation for Requeim.

It wasn’t just a game — it was one of our happiest memories together.
We’d take turns, shout when the Ganados came rushing in, and laugh when we both panicked.

Now, years later, I’m here playing Resident Evil 4 Remake…
but this time, I’m alone.
My brother isn’t here anymore, and that makes this experience bittersweet —
like I’m playing for both of us.

This remake isn’t just a visual upgrade.
It captures the soul of the original while giving us something fresh, intense, and modern.
The atmosphere, the tension, the details — everything feels familiar yet new again.
It’s like visiting your childhood home after many years — different, but still home.

If you loved the original, play this.
If you never did, now’s the perfect time.
And if you’re waiting for a sale — go ahead, grab it when it drops.

Everything about the game is perfect, there are only a few set pieces that didn't land for me and that can be chalked up to a skill issue and on my first play through I challenged myself on the hardest difficulty. Other than that everything landed.

Horror? I mean yeah some sections are clench your hole and cry levels of scary but it isn't like RE2 or RE7 at all.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,207000072,"It's always a treat to play a contender for one of the best games of all time and it's rare for that game to come from arguable the most influential game of the last two decades.  The RE4 remake is a dazzling accomplishment in which I found appeal in every aspect.  I have one gripe with the whole game but this is an absolute modern classic and should be played as blind as possible.

(+)  I've played this countless times on PS5 and my PC run still felt fresh as the fidelity is really felt from a powerful rig.  I had everything firing at max settings and it ran beautifully smooth with even surfaces like bloodsplatters hanging in the air and the spent casings from your weapons reflecting light.  The RE engine punches up the impact of everything you do and I felt every knife slash and bullet spent was brought back up to the level of RE2R's gore which never lost its shine and gives the combat back its teeth which was dulled in the RE3 remake.  The sheer variety of enemy design puppeteered by the dynamic and reactive AI means even after 100+ hours on console and hot off a play-through I would be more than happy to go back through using all the different weapons again and again.  The game is split into thirds making this feel like three games mashed into one, even before the spectacular Separate Ways DLC.  I played the classic RE4 before tackling the remake and the remake is lovingly recreated with only a few strands of fat cut off.  The team at Capcom shoved out a flabby RE3 remake but the trade-off meant a timeless masterpiece in the RE4 remake.  I believe this is the perfect action-horror game and its terror is in overwhelming odds, even though I've upgraded every weapon and can get by untouched there's always a gripping sense of panic when enemies burst through walls and crash through doors.  The presentation of the narrative, I thought, was great and a lot more personality and quirks are given to the supporting cast which was a really nice touch showing the attentiveness of the developers in keeping everything consistently excellent.  With just the base campaign there is enough here to prove value for money at full price but I did nab the Gold Edition on CDKeys for around seven pounds which is daylight robbery on my end.  I really enjoyed the Separate Ways DLC as it leans more-so into frenetic combat and gives Ada a more robust arsenal from the off which gives it a nice rapid pace through your five or so hours with it.  The DLC gives a nice twist into offering another perspective of the main story and I felt was a proper realisation of what they were shooting for with RE2R by giving the story an A and a B para-narrative.  What little was cut from the original was in the DLC and I adored how they went the extra effort in bringing that content back.  

(-)  My only gripe with the game is that there's too much yellow paint splashed around, everything you can interact with pretty much has either paint or tape on it.  The game achieves such a groundbreaking level of fidelity in its environmental design that it was always distracting having everything coated in this sickly yellow colour.

Overall, this is a modern day masterpiece and it was astounding to play-through a game I know rocketed right into my favourite games of all time.  I genuinely don't know how they're going to top this but this game should be in everyone's library.  It worked flawlessly with my X1X controller and I had zero technological problems.  I was finally finished with my full sweep in just under 19 hours.  I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone.",True,6,1138

Not sure what there is to say that hasn't been said. Capcom took a tedious game mechanic (Escorting NPCs) and somehow made it fun and engaging. Ashley is a much more interesting character and you really just want to protect her the entire game. The combat and gameplay are very seamless and there's lots of shortcuts and optimizations to make your runs faster and better each time. Multiple guns keep playthroughs engaging and unique.

There's nothing too serious to complain about either. There's a tiny bit of performance drops near the start of the game but the rest of it ran flawlessly for me. The puzzles are a bit shorter and basic this time around but they do change based on your difficulty. I do also wish there was a chapter select which would help practicing for Professional runs if that's something that interests you. Charms being RNG trinkets that you can't farm can be annoying as there's no way to guarantee to get the exact charm you want/need. Did you miss out on that RPG discount?

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206877484,"  The original Resident Evil 4 has always held a special place in my heart. I got it for my 9th birthday from a friend who was fully convinced I'd be scared enough to never make it to the end. I ended up beating the game way before he eventually did. It, along with Evil Dead 2 (shout out), helped train me to get past my scares and kickstart my fascination for the horror genre. 
  Well, it's a little later down the decades, and I finally got around to finishing the Resident Evil 4 remake! There was so much going through my head during the experience, I decided to write another review for my thoughts.

[h1] Visuals + Music [/h1]

  Captures the exact vibes of the original game, and adds a lot on top of it. The RE Engine does wonders for character models, so you can expect a lot of the enemies you see in this game to look extra gross (complimentary) and tons more satisfying to pop bullets through (see, complimentary). The environments are visually stunning for just being grey castles and European villages. Every corner is filled with grime and blood, with small hints at how life used to be before everything went sideways. 
  The music makes for great accompaniment to everything going on in-game. When you're walking through dark and empty corridors, it's eerie and feels claustrophobic. By the next door you get through, BOOM! a wave of cultists show up and suddenly the music is zippy and action-packed. Themes that should hypothetically clash actually transition into each other quite well, due in part to this game's score.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

  My favorite thing about RE4 is how organic player progression was. You start with just a simple pistol and the constant feeling of being overrun with enemies. In spite of its semi-tanky controls, by the end of the experience you feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator. RE4R thankfully maintains the satisfaction of that, while adding more to really sell Leon's ""highly skilled secret agent"" feel. To start:
[b] YOU CAN MOVE WHILE SHOOTING NOW [/b]
  In fact, everything about the combat feels like a plus, and probably where RE4R does its best work. The weapons handle great and every shot you land on an enemy's weak point is extremely satisfying to pull off. Leon is able to utilize his knife way more too, using it to parry and sneak-attack enemies (yes, stealth is also a thing now, kinda) at the cost of newly-added durability. Inventory management is virtually the same, with the only big additions being the new charms and case types that give you different perks. These new additions, of course, can be earned from the fan-favorite Merchant character, who returns with weapons, weapon upgrades, a shooting range, new side quests to complete, and a lot of things to say (seriously, he gets really chatty in this one).

[h1] Story [/h1] 

  Virtually the same as it was in the OG. Leon S. Kennedy is back in action to rescue Ashley Graham; the U.S. President's daughter; from a cult under the control of a parasite dubbed ""Las Plagas"". In contrast to the original, RE4R seems to aim for a darker tone that treats its setting and characters more seriously, though not without the occasional comedic one-liner to lighten the mood. To its benefit, this change gives old players a fresh take on the original, while modernizing towards the taste of a newer audience. The darker tone helps ramp up the horror, too. There were sequences in this that went from merely giving me the chills in the original, to having me scream like old-school Pewdiepie as my viewers watch me sprint for the exit. Either the writing got better or I've gone soft.
  Another thing I enjoyed about RE4R is how it fleshes every character out, and I mean [u] everyone. [/u] Though he still has his corny wit, Leon is less of a campy action star here. He's under pressure. You really see how the events of RE2 affected him, and empathize more for his desire to prevent something like the Raccoon City incident from happening again. Luis gets more screentime and not only has his motivations fleshed out, but also plays a more enjoyable comedic foil to Leon's ""straight-man"" personality. I liked how they expanded on the lore of enemies and bosses here, too, through new dialogue and notes scattered through the locations you explore that dig deep into the history of the game's settings.
  I [i] particularly [/i] enjoyed the changes they made for Ashley. She's evolved from a bratty escort mission, becoming a companion that goes through a far more compelling arc that makes her feel like an endearing friend by the end credits. She's also a lot better gameplay-wise, too, avoiding enemies when needed and even helping Leon out in some of the many puzzles.

[h1] In Conclusion/TL;DR [/h1]

  To this day, Resident Evil 4 is lauded as an all-time great in the survival-horror genre. I'm pleased to say that RE4 Remake lives up to the legacy. Everything they did well in 2004 is emulated faithfully here, but the new additions improve on the experience tenfold. If you're an OG player whose owned/played the original on 50 different consoles and [i] still [/i] want a fresh experience, give the remake a go. If you're a newcomer to the franchise, or horror games in general, maybe this is the game that gets you past the horror scares just like Resident Evil 4 did for me all those years ago...

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206876722,"As a diehard fan of the original release of RE4 and subsequent ports, my two concerns were freshness and familiarity. The experience is not the same, in a good way, new mechanics add more depth to an already exquisite gameplay (i.e. stealth, backstabbing and knife durability). The ""survival horror"" aspect is more present, but the ""action"" part feels heightened as well. Story and locations are scrambled and reimagined, making this feel like a ""gaiden"" version more than a ""remake"". These new aspects take some time to sink in, my first playthrough on hardcore ended at almost 30 hours, yet replay value is high and i'm already speedruning the game on professional withouot special weapons.

I've played a good amount of the original game and this is obviously a step up because of the years of new technology and innovation in the gaming space. The parry mechanic is wonderfully done and well balanced, making the enemies faster and more ferocious as the difficulty scales. The knife mostly justifies the jump in speed. I kinda got whiplash when playing the first chapter as enemies run toward you unlike the slow walk in the original game, this is because the aiming mechanic has changed massively from the original.

While I do think there are very difficult sections where ammo is immensely scarce at parts, but at the same time that makes you utilize the knife mechanics more as you can actively engage in knife-only combat with good movement and good parry timing. This is more because I play on hardcore, but I do enjoy the challenge.

I recommend playing this game. The story-line is great . the graphics are magnificent and it has great fight mechanics. 
But... 
some movements are not optimized 
there were some glitches in close up combats

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206680164,"Review: Resident Evil 4 (Remake)

Overall:
An almost perfect game. The pacing, visuals, and atmosphere are phenomenal, and the remake captures the essence of the original while improving nearly every aspect.

Critique:
The only part I didn’t fully enjoy was the military base area — it felt slightly out of place compared to the rest of the environments and broke the otherwise consistent tone of the game.

Verdict:
Despite that minor flaw, Resident Evil 4 remains one of the best survival horror experiences ever made.

I think that gives me a less biased view on the games, and I can readily say this is a worthy remake. I'm not sure I like it better than the original overall, but this game has a lot going for it. I still think the original is very much worth playing even after beating this remake, but you wouldn't be doing yourself a terrible disservice by only playing this. It definitely has a more serious tone than the original; while Leon still cracks one liners pretty consistently, the writing overall is less silly. I don't necessarily mean that in a good or bad way, it's just different. As for gameplay, I really enjoyed it, especially after the early game where I suffered from severe skill issues. Hardcore is a good challenge, and as recommended by the game, I wouldn't play it first unless you've played RE4 or just like hard games. I don't think stuns are quite as satisfying in this game, and enemies seem marginally more bullet spongy, but overall the combat experience is very smooth. Overall, the this remake kept most of what made the original so good, and where it does change or add from the formula, I would say it's rarely for the worse.

DLC Separate Ways is pretty good, its the same game but different pov so can't really do a bad dlc out of that, still, i think the price is way too high, actually the dlc should be included for free since its basically a second campaign but on ada's pov, that'd be fair, but well, atleast the dlc exists lol

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206386118,"After finishing RE2, I didn't really get the hype around Leon S. Kennedy. This game made me get it, to the point where I'd say he could be in the conversation for greatest video game protagonist. My only real complaint after finishing the game is that I felt it was lacking the horror aspect that I love from this genre, it may be because RE7 and Village was my introduction to the franchise, but there were only a few sections during my playthrough that I'd say was truly scary. But that's the only negative the game had that I noticed. There's an incredibly small number of games that are so well-paced and engaging, that there's never a moment where I'm not having fun, and RE4 is one of them. The combat has no right being as good as it is for a survival horror game, with a satisfying knife parry mechanic, roundhouse kick, killer suplex, and some fun progression in weapon unlocks and upgrades. The music was great and how it could quickly change to accompany crazy action moments to creepy horror sections was done really well. I also enjoyed the chemistry between Leon and Ashley and the little moments they shared between all the chaos. I was also surprised by how quickly the game made me care about Ashley from the first few moments after meeting her. Boss fights were amazing, Action set-pieces were incredible, and a satisfying conclusion to top it all off. I really hope we see more of Leon soon...",True,0,1711

 The music, sound effects and voice acting are all inferior to the original where things were just solid in a way, Leon carries far more weight, they also changed Ashley's section for the worse, she was chased around and had to do a hard puzzle but it felt nice, in this remake she just shuts down any and all threats with a flashlight

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206253350,"Resident Evil 4 Remake — Reviewed by Albert Wesker

So… they’ve done it again.
They’ve taken one of the most flawless specimens in gaming history — my favorite experiment in human desperation — and decided to reconstruct it, piece by piece. A dangerous endeavor. After all, tampering with perfection rarely ends well… unless I’m the one doing the tampering.

Yet, to my astonishment, Capcom managed to resurrect Resident Evil 4 with a degree of precision I can almost… admire. Almost.

Let’s begin with the most obvious variable: Leon S. Kennedy.
Still sporting that golden hair and smug confidence, only now he’s aged — seasoned by trauma and polished by experience. He moves with purpose, fights with style, and quips with… questionable restraint. He’s matured, yes, but the boy still clings to his delusions of heroism. The man cannot accept that the system he serves is every bit as rotten as Umbrella ever was.
A shame. He could’ve made an excellent operative.

The gameplay — improved, streamlined, but never diluted. The knife, once a desperate last resort, is now an extension of survival instinct. It breaks, it mends, it evolves — much like the series itself. Combat is fluid, savage, and precise.
For once, I felt the faintest glimmer of challenge.

The village, the castle, the island — all reimagined with such atmosphere it’s almost intoxicating. Each area drips with dread, history, and blood. The Las Plagas return in glorious form — beautifully grotesque, endlessly mutating. I find it comforting to see that humanity continues to produce such admirable monstrosities.

And Ada Wong…
Ah, still the enigma. Still a master manipulator in crimson silk. Her presence lingers like a shadow in every scene — though her voice this time… lacks the venom it once carried. A pity. But her mission? Her secrecy? Impeccable.

Then there’s Luis Serra.
Refined, witty, and finally given the narrative weight he deserved. He’s no longer a throwaway scientist — he’s a man with ideals, regret, and brilliance. I can respect that. Had Umbrella not imploded under its own arrogance, he’d have been valuable to my cause.

But let’s not ignore Saddler and his cult of zealots. Still amusing. Still pitiful. The Las Plagas in their hands are like a masterpiece painted with mud.
To think — such potential wasted on religious fanaticism. Typical.

Yet despite these quibbles, I cannot deny the craftsmanship. The sound, the lighting, the tension — all re-forged into something elegant and cruel. It feels… alive.

Still, I must be honest. The remake lacks the raw shock of its predecessor. It’s refined, but safer. Controlled. Sanitized for modern audiences. The edges have been polished — and with that polish, some of the madness is lost.
It’s no longer reckless genius. It’s disciplined success.

My verdict:
A near-perfect reconstruction of an already perfect creation. Beautiful. Efficient. Ruthlessly modern.
But where the original was an experiment spiraling into glorious chaos, this one feels… contained.
Too clinical. Too human.

9 out of 10.
A remarkable mutation — but one that still needs a touch of Wesker’s influence to achieve true perfection.",True,0,668

**I. Purchase**  
Buy the Gold Edition of Resident Evil 4 Remake. It is the best version for beginners to experience the  Resident Evil.

**II. Settings**  
After starting the game, go to settings and turn off all online features. In the controls section, familiarize yourself with the controls, then choose ""Assisted"" difficulty to begin.

**III. Important Controls**  
1. **F Key** – Used for important interactions like checking and picking up items. If you get stuck, try looking around carefully and press F on unusual spots.  
   Also, it is recommended to shoot enemies in the legs to stagger them, then press F up close to perform a melee attack. This saves ammo and controls the situation.

2. **Dodge (E Key) & Parry (Spacebar)** – Some attacks can be dodged by pressing E. When an enemy is about to hit you, press Spacebar to raise your knife and parry. A successful parry not only avoids damage but also staggers the enemy, creating a good chance to counterattack.

3. **Q Key** – Used for a quick turn.

4. **Managing the  Case** – Press Tab to open the  case.  
   (Use Shift to move items, Q to rotate items, Alt to organize items, and Ctrl to store/retrieve items in the temporary slot.)

5. **Commanding Ashley** – Use the Ctrl key to give Ashley commands, telling her to wait in a safe spot or follow you closely.

**IV. Using flingtraine **  
Play until you find the ""Typewriter"" save point, save,then exit the game.  
Go to the website of  flingtrainer com, search for Resident Evil 4, and download the trainer.  
This trainer requires REFramework by praydog to bypass the game’s anti-cheat protection. Follow these steps:  
1. Copy ""dinput8.dll"" to the game directory (the same folder as re4.exe).  
2. Launch the game.  
3. Open trainer, UNLOCK ALL EXTRA CONTENT SHOP ITEMS , and set CP to 99,999. Use the shop to buy the ""Cat Ears"" accessory (provides unlimited ammo) and other items you want.  
4. In the game, equip the Cat Ears accessory in the accessories menu, then load game
5. Close Fengling Yueying and save, start enjoying the game.  
6. When you meet the mysterious merchant, you can reopen trainer  to edit PESETAS  and  SPINELS for easier shopping.",True,0,1503

I've never played the Original on the Gamecube or any other system so I can't judge how faithful to the original it is but even  on its own it's a great game.
It plays alot like Resident Evil 2 Remake or Resident Evil 3 Remake, but is way more action-oriented than those two.

The greaphics are great while still not insanely demanding. I am hitting between 80-144fps at WQHD at max details, without RT, with a 8086k and 6900XT.

The sound and music amplify the mood and atmosphere. I mean if you are sneaking through a dark laboratory complex why wouldn't you want to hear a raspy-breathing in the dark while reading about a new kind of monster they've created?!

The storyline is typical Resident Evil, so basically a hommage to the action/horror movies from the 90s and 2000s.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206156558,"Such an all-around great game. RE4 has some of the best TPS gameplay I've experienced with tense close-quarters combat requiring a good deal of spatial awareness and resource conservation. The story is as deeply fascinating as it is creepy as hell, set in some backwoods part of Spain seemingly forgotten by time. Creature designs are grotesquely cool and characters benefit from unexpectedly good EN voice (re)casting that is pleasantly grounded and doesn't detract at all from the immersion. 

Many will attest to RE4's stellar combat and story experience, but I particularly want to highlight its impressive replay value. Most games naturally want to keep you engaged with optional achievements and collectibles, but they rarely succeed in actually making me [b]want[/b] to play through the game again. RE4 does just that. This is primarily a testament to the game's excellent gameplay, but players are also encouraged to approach a 2nd (3rd, 4th...) playthrough in meaningfully different ways. 

There are achievements that reward self-imposed handicaps that make the game more challenging, but the rewards earned for clearing the game on each difficulty also add to or enhance your arsenal in ways that will give you an edge during future playthroughs. I am not someone who is typically interested in attempting speed runs, but the reasonable length of the game and the variety of ways these upgrades allow you to better manage, avoid, or (amusingly) trivialize certain parts of the progression make aiming for those higher rank speed-based completions legitimately enticing. 

The only criticism I might offer is that incoming boss attacks can be awkward to avoid due to how sluggish movement is compared to the dodge and roll mechanics of more modern games. I consistently end up tanking several hits and think I'd enjoy these fights even more if the dodging were primarily QTE based. Honestly though, there is so little to complain about. This is likely one of the best remakes of a classic ever produced and the things they changed or added - including the Separate Ways DLC - only make the experience that much better.",True,0,3420

Leon is back (my favorite twink cop) and DAMN is he well written, and awesome. From what I've heard this Remake changed a lot of things, and it focused more on Leon as a whole instead of other things in the original. I personally like this.. since I love knowing more about Leon. 

The gameplay is SO GOOD!! In RE:2 / RE:3 I more or less shot stunned enemies a lot because everyone was a bullet sponge, but in this game? You can KICK them if you shoot them in the head most of the times. I had a blast killing enemies in this game, and there's a lot of variety. 

I also really loved the exploration element. I truly felt rewarded every time I went for every piece of treasure, and the merchant is a great addition! It felt so nice upgrading my weapons, etc. His challenges were also neat! Overall I SERIOUSLY like the merchant. 

There's nothing else to add (I can talk about the story, but I won't spoil) I highly recommend this game! And I highly recommend playing RE:2 before this one.

Game is good. Story is great. Gameplay is awesome. Replayability is nice, and so on!",True,8,1022
Resident Evil 4,2050650,206150265,"An otherwise amazing game that is heavily burdened by the fact that the developers decided to put in multiple points where you cannot backtrack to pick up missed treasures, weapons or requests, with absolutely no warning that you will not be able to return, making it an absolute pain in the fucking ass for completionists. I understand not being able to return to the previous major area after you move on to the next one, but why block off a random staircase? Why can't I climb up a ledge that looks the same as every other clime-able ledge in the game? It's absolutely ridiculous and annoying as all hell.

there are a few minor things i dislike, but they are nitpicks, like the weapon stat upgrades for money. i'd rather have more actual part customization than just stat increases.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,206080064,"A fresh perspective to a classic title. 

When taken for what it is (a remake), this game still holds up to it's predecessor.

Here we get an overhaul to a game that by today's standards is a tad out-dated. From character models, to locations, this games fresh take keeps in a lot of the old ones charm. 

Game play mechanics have had an overhaul too, keeping game play fresh, fluid and enjoyable.

A long with the story.

I don't want to ruin anything, but if you enjoyed the old one, or any other RE series, this one is more action, than survival horror. But it only edges it out. The colour scheme has a lot more depth and contrast too.


Well worth picking up on sale if you're on the fence. 50% or more, for all DLC... Is certainly worth it for well over 80 hours of fun.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205974883,"Resident Evil 4 Remake is one of the most fun and action-packed games in the series. The story is solid, the pacing is great, and the mix of intense combat and cinematic set pieces keeps things exciting from start to finish. There are tons of weapons to choose from and a good variety of enemies, so the gameplay never feels repetitive. The music fits every moment perfectly, from calm exploration to chaotic boss fights.

The characters are great and have real chemistry, especially Leon and Ashley. Leon’s cheesy one-liners are back and they still make me smile. This is easily the least scary Resident Evil game, but it makes up for that with nonstop action, amazing level design, and over-the-top moments that feel straight out of an action movie. My only real complaint is how often Ashley gets captured—it starts to feel a bit repetitive after a while.

The Separate Ways DLC adds even more to love. Playing as Ada was great, and it was really cool to see what she was doing behind the scenes while helping Leon without him knowing. It makes the story feel more complete and adds nice replay value.

🔫 How I Play — Weapon Tips
Here’s what worked best for me:
• 	Stick to the basics: Pistol, shotgun, rifle, and your trusty knife. That’s all you really need.
• 	Don’t waste money on every new gun the merchant offers. Most of them aren’t worth it.
• 	Sell the extras and focus on upgrading your main weapons all the way. Max out their damage, reload speed, and capacity.
• 	If the merchant drops a better version of your go-to weapon (like a new shotgun or rifle), sell the old one, grab the new one, and upgrade it again.
It’s all about keeping your loadout lean and powerful.
💣 Pro Tip: Rocket Launcher
Buy one. Just one. And don’t use it until the final boss.
• 	Keep it in your inventory by Chapter 15.
• 	When the last fight hits, whip it out and boom—problem solved.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205884679,"Pro:
Capcom has once again proven that they know how to bring a classic back to life. The remake of Resident Evil 4 captures everything that made the original special while modernizing it in all the right ways.

The graphics are absolutely stunning — every dark corridor, eerie forest, and rain-soaked village feels alive and cinematic. The attention to detail is incredible, from Leon’s expressions to the atmospheric lighting that constantly keeps you on edge.

The gameplay feels smoother than ever, with the updated controls making combat more responsive and satisfying. The balance between action and horror is perfect — intense but never overwhelming.

The writing and voice acting are top-tier, and Leon’s charming one-liners are still here, now delivered with even more style and confidence. The pacing is tight, the boss fights are thrilling, and the overall tone perfectly walks the line between scary and fun.

Capcom also managed to enhance the story and characters, adding emotional depth without losing the campy charm of the original. It feels respectful and fresh at the same time — exactly what a remake should be.

---

Con:
Honestly, it’s hard to find real flaws. Some fans might miss the original’s goofier moments, and the difficulty spikes can be a bit rough at times. But those are minor nitpicks in an otherwise masterful remake.

Rating: 10/10

Resident Evil 4 Remake is not just a nostalgia trip — it’s a brilliant reimagining of one of gaming’s best experiences.

After playing for a longer time, I had enough with it's idiotic puzzles and requested a refund. I stopped at chapter 3 level 14 with it's idiotic power puzzle in the Cargo depot. It was the second or third time I had to check online for a solution. If I wanted to play a puzzle and solve something I would buy a rubik's cube and play that. At first the game was fun, later I had enough with it's puzzles.

I had more fun playing the original, and I passed that game about 30 times when I was a teenager. Original has puzzles, but not on every corner, like here with it's stupid power puzzles in chapter 3.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205835853,"TL;DR: remake is worse than the original, particularly lacking enemy flanking sound queues and some basic sound design. Seems to go out of its way to make combat more unpleasant & less fun with spongy enemies that don't react to bullets.

I grew up playing RE4 on the gamecube. Spent easily 1000+ hours on it doing lots of challenge runs and speedruns because i just loved the shit out of that game. Approaching this game with some of those tactics still in my head 20 years later may have tainted my experience. I played this with a controller, which was probably a big mistake.

1. Limited enemy reaction to damage - staggering enemies is either RNG based or hp based. Old game, you shoot a guy in the head or knees, he staggers and you can melee. this was critical for early crowd control when your primary tool was the pistol. Now in the remake, I regularly shoot enemies in the head 3 times without getting a stagger, sometimes twice without even a hitstun. Effect here is likely by design since it forces more usage of shotgun and grenades in order to handle crowds, but making generic enemies eat bullets to the face with no reaction feels awful, especially since this was a huge selling point for the original game. Maybe the short-term solution is to bench the pistol?

2. Crosshair depth - old game rooted you in place when shooting, and you aimed with a laser pointer. Now you have classic shooter crosshairs with variable spread etc, but you don't have a laser projection from your weapon, if enemies get too close your ability to hit them greatly decreases since your aiming function sources the camera, not your character model.
 
3. Lack of sound cues. This is probably the worst one for me, and I doubt I can mod it away. Maybe I leaned on these too much back in the day, but having an enemy grab/chop/stab you from behind with zero sound cue that you're being flanked was very unpleasant, especially with how the game forces you to tunnel-vision on the targets in front of you with the aim camera and fov zoom. Having to shoot the guy in front of you 3+ times in the head while being unable to hear the ladder being placed behind you or getting a sound cue from a flanking foe really highlights how they made the game worse.

And I'm only two hours in. I have no idea how this game is being reviewed so well when its objectively worse than the original. I hope I can aggressively mod to mitigate these issues, or faster aiming with m&kb could make issue #2 more tolerable.

In the original game, combat was a relatively slow and calculated process that spawned an entire genre - juggling enemies with the ammo and tools provided with reliable enemy hitstun and stagger, and that proverbial boat was rocked when a parasite head or a thicker enemy type appeared - this changed your priorities, forced a brief retreat, reposition, or weapon swap. This design spawned an entire goddamn genre.  Now your boat gets rocked as soon as more than two enemies are in your line of sight, not to mention the silent/invisible enemies behind you due to lack of basic sound design. Maybe this is more survival-horror-y? I find bullet sponge enemies in this game tedious, especially when there's a wall of them in front of you.

I can only fathom the overwhelmingly positive reviews are due to lack of experience with the original game, or if m&kb really fixes everything. The original was a vastly superior experience - and Salazar had a nice hat that I now have to mod in. This remake, so far, feels very small time. Huge disappointment.

p.s. i would give away instant grab-breaks and the upgradable combat knife for the old game's unbreakable basic knife without a moments hesitation.",False,11,139

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205710331,"[b]+ Combat:[/b] Feels challenging due to reduced mobility. Limited ammunition is a constraint but you rarely run out. Scripted stages where you are swarmed and need to defend a position are tense and fun, especially in Act 1. Unfortunately, the slow movement speed (even when running) makes boss fights annoying. It forces you to exploit the environment to avoid projectile hits (e.g., Act 2 boss) but then again, there are empty arena stages where you don't have any cover.

[b]+ Well paced:[/b] Each chapter takes ~1h to beat, there being 16 chapters total. During each chapter you get 1-2 save points, so you can play the game in short stints of 20-30m.

[b]+ Atmosphere:[/b] All three zones feel unique and interesting, although I prefer Act 1. The deserted villages and dark woods make for a better horror setting. One small annoyance is that sometimes, the tense music persists even after dispatching all threats in the area. Otherwise, the game blends serious themes with lighthearted moments very well (e.g., optional shooting ranges available at the vendor from time to time).

[b]- Companion:[/b] Utterly useless and can largely be ignored. Her story arc should see her become more independent and actually useful until the end of the game, but this is only shown in cut-scenes. During fights, she gets constantly downed or abducted, which represents a game over if not prevented. Would have liked to see her become more involved in fights as the game progresses.

[b]- Leans towards action:[/b] At this point in the franchise, the game started to resemble more of a zombie shooter than a survival horror, which is a shame. There is a short sequence in Act 2 where you play as Ashely (the companion) and due to her lack of combat skills, that ended up being one of the highlights of the entire game.

[b]- Act 3:[/b] To me, the first 2-3 chapters of this act ruin the whole game. Initially, it gives the illusion of stealth-based approaches to each level, but the stealth mechanics are so poorly implemented that you get spotted almost immediately: stay out of spotlights but still get seen, enter a room only to instantly alert all mobs on the floor. Ammo drops (and gunpowder - for crafting) are also significantly reduced in this act. This becomes a problem when a new monster type (the Regenerator, I think it was called) is introduced. It can only be killed by using an IR scope to target its weak points. This scope can only be attacked to rifles and SMGs. If you lack ammo for these weapons, you're shit out of luck.",True,0,947

*Resident Evil 4 Remake* and its DLC *Separate Ways* deliver a masterclass in modern survival horror. Capcom has not only revitalized a legendary title but expanded its universe with elegance, intensity, and emotional depth.

---

🎮 **Resident Evil 4 Remake: A Reinvention Done Right**  
This remake elevates the original with fluid controls, refined combat mechanics, and a perfectly paced blend of action and tension. Leon S. Kennedy returns with sharper wit and deeper characterization, navigating a world that feels both familiar and freshly terrifying. The RE Engine brings every shadowy corridor and grotesque enemy to life with stunning realism.

🧠 **Narrative Depth and Character Evolution**  
The story is more mature, with richer dialogue and stronger emotional stakes. Ashley is no longer a passive companion—she’s smart, capable, and well-written. Villains like Salazar and Krauser are more menacing, and Luis Serra becomes a standout character with surprising charm and complexity.

🎨 **Visuals and Sound Design That Stun**  
From the eerie village to the gothic castle and militarized island, every location is dripping with atmosphere. The lighting, textures, and animations are top-tier, and the sound design—creaking floorboards, distant screams, chilling music—amplifies the dread at every turn.

---

🔴 **Separate Ways: Ada Wong’s Moment to Shine**  
This DLC isn’t just an add-on—it’s essential. *Separate Ways* offers a parallel storyline that fills in narrative gaps and adds new layers to the main plot. Ada Wong is sleek, mysterious, and deadly, with gameplay that emphasizes agility, stealth, and gadgetry. Her interactions with Wesker hint at deeper conspiracies, enriching the lore.

🧩 **Smart Level Design and Fresh Mechanics**  
Ada’s missions are varied and cleverly constructed, with new puzzles, combat scenarios, and traversal options. The pacing is tight, the stakes are high, and the boss fights are unforgettable. It’s a thrilling ride from start to finish.

---

✨ **Final Verdict**  
Together, *Resident Evil 4 Remake* and *Separate Ways* form a complete, exhilarating package. They honor the legacy of the original while pushing the franchise forward in bold, cinematic ways. Whether you're a longtime fan or a newcomer, this is survival horror at its finest.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205646550,"Mixed review.

The shortest way I can describe for the Resi4 Remake is that it delivers same passion and example as the original one with a few changes. Most visible ones are few skipping shortcuts, new weapons some being stripped down or another and some cut content from the original. My biggest complaints are timings and hitboxes with parry system additionally given the different directions with the cutscenes. I wouldn't mind these things a lot but trying to go for speedrun achievements kinda made me realize that they've not polished some hiccups with the new systems provided for the game. And it feels way more stripped down as some of the content is not here and moved towards Separate Ways DLC, which is behind paywall and not coming in for free with the whole package like in the original. Additionally skipping on filler Assignment: Ada. (Still odd how in remake Ada and Krauser never make any eye contact)

Now allow me to also break down the more bull turd mechanics added in. Previously in the original Resi4 you had collectible blue medallions used for gallery view with playable sounds and whenever you win all the shooting gallery rounds. In Remake however, you can test your skills by perfecting them. But you also get special medals now, being silver and gold which doesn't really matter- since you still get random chances of playing gacha unlocks. Yes, they added gacha in Remake. Worst part is that there's a speed bonus charm you can attach to your attache case. Which ruins the immersion and the illusion of Leon not running fast enough as his movement is nerfed due to charm's existence. Thus having all of the charms being from the original Resi4 models isn't cute, it's a tease. Makes you wanna question why even bother making HD Project as an official release for Resi4 Original in the first place.

Regardless, I think I had my dosage of repeating this game multiple times but I'd still prefer the original due to enough cheesiness and one-liners with movie cliches given. In Remake you're given less of it. I'm also not too keen how they've pumped up DLCs with ""easing"" up your runs? Yes, some folks don't have much time but also defeats purpose even further on completing these games.",False,4,6221

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205612089,"The original RE4 (2005) is about as close to mechanically perfect a game that’s ever been made, and still stands as an action horror masterpiece, and the fact they managed to remake it exceptionally well and not mess it up, is pretty incredible. They definitely play differently and have their own feel, which lets both the original and the remake stand on their own. 

Taking the excellent movement and gore damage system from Resident Evil 2 Remake and adding a much faster pace to Leon, as well as the inclusion of the Parry mechanic to the combat works brilliantly. 

Leon, Ashley and Luis Sera are all exceptionally well characterized. Luis Sera especially in this remake is a standout, they did a fantastic job with him. Leon is a complete badass like he’s always been, he has the natural evolution you’d expect from his experience in Raccoon City to becoming a highly trained operative, he’s excellent. 

Ashley Graham was beyond irritating in the original game, whereas here she comes across as a real character, who is understandably horrified by the situation she’s in and defers to Leon’s experience and relies on him to get her out this situation alive. Great stuff, it makes both Leon and Ashley super likable the entire way through.  

The environments are remarkably faithful to the original while adding logical changes, the Ganados, Verdugo and Regeneradors are spot on. The RE Engine still looks amazing graphically and the boss battles are super fun. As far as remakes go, this is up there with Resident Evil 2 and Dead Space Remake for sheer effort and quality.

The remake modernizes the combat and gameplay in an incredible way and makes everything feel familiar but fresh! All of the characters we know and love are brought back in a spectacular way. Leon the badass doing unnecessary backflips. Louis as charming as ever. Every boss fight just a joy and also terrifying at times. 

The optional side quests add such a fun and unique aspect to the game. Heavily expanding the original's blue medallion side quest and I absolutely love it. Unique enemies, items and treasures all can be found as a result. At no point was I left feeling underwhelmed. 

Then the Operation Ada DLC brings back one of my favorite enemies in an incredibly fun way... Literally cannot say more good things. If you played the OG, or are a fan.

At first I was not very fond of the ""massive enemy waves"" gameplay loop, especially after RE2-3, with more survival based approach and relatively rare enemies. But with time, especially on the second playthrough with unbreakable knife, upgraded weapons and general knowledge of the game - it kinda grew on me. I have to admit it was kinda good. When you figure out how this game runs, dealing with many enemies at once becomes manageble and you can conserve plenty of ammo with strategic crossbow usage.

Compared to the original (I have never played it, but saw screens/gameplay) - I absolutely love updated Ashley design. She is incredibly lovely! Tbh, the whole second playthrough was just that I could spend some more time with her, lol.

Visuals? Well they are great. If you have played any of the new/remastered Biohazard games you already know that the RE-engine is capable of stunning graphics with a hi-rez textures and a solid FPS-counter as well, even on a low-mid tier machines. Absolutely no complains here.

Vibes-wise Re4 is closest to the Re8:Village. They honestly feel kinda the samey - lone european village with a castle, with some influental mid-bosses and a mysterious ""profet"" running the whole cult. But gameplay wise I have to armit that Re8 is far superior to the 4th. Here we mostly fight hordes of enemies and that's it, while in Re8 there are many different gameplay segments with widely varied mechanics, vibes and enemy types. This doesn't make Re4 ""bad"" but just shows that modern gameplay design has indeed evolved and is capable of much more than before, which is good. But still you can see many ideas from Re4 being implimented (and elevated) in Re8. So if you have funds only for the 1 game, you will have to decide what is more important to you - overally better and deeper gameplay (and dommy-mommy Dimitrescu) or an old-school familiarity (and cutesy Ashley-chan).

In my opinion both are good. :)

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205448452,"Resident Evil 4: Gold Edition – Worth Every Second

As someone who loved the original Resident Evil 4, I had high expectations going into the remake — and this Gold Edition absolutely delivers. It’s the complete package, and honestly, the best way to play the game if you haven’t already.

The base game is just fantastic. The story is intense, the atmosphere is creepy in the best way, and the gameplay feels smooth and modern while still keeping that classic RE4 vibe. Leon is still the sarcastic action hero we remember, but the tone is darker and more grounded this time around. The combat feels great, especially with the new parry system. It adds a lot more depth without being overwhelming.

What really makes the Gold Edition shine is the Separate Ways DLC. Ada Wong’s story adds a ton of value. Her missions feel fresh, and the grapple gun changes how you move through the world — it’s fast, fun, and gives you more tactical options. Plus, it fills in a lot of story gaps from Leon’s campaign in a satisfying way.

The graphics are top-tier (seriously, some of the environments are jaw-dropping), the sound design is on point, and there’s a ton of replay value between the main campaign, Ada’s story, and Mercenaries Mode.

If you’re new to Resident Evil or just want to revisit one of the best entries in the series, this is the version to get. The Gold Edition is absolutely worth it.

As a lifelong Resident Evil fan who’s played every mainline title and remake, I can confidently say: Capcom nailed it.

The Resident Evil 4 Remake is everything a remake should be—faithful, modernized, and full of smart refinements. Combat is tighter and more intense, the atmosphere is darker and richer, and the characters are better developed (Ashley is actually likable!). The parry system adds depth, and the side content is a welcome addition without overstaying its welcome.

It’s not just a retread—it’s a reimagining that respects the original while improving nearly every aspect. This is survival horror and action in perfect balance.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,205374348,"First off, don't be fooled by the playtime you see on this review. I have 100% completed this game on Xbox.

The first thing that I would like to get out of the way is that the original Resident Evil 4 is among my top 10 favorite games of all time, but the weapon upgrade tickets that they sell as DLC? COMPLETELY unacceptable. This is absolutely the WORST kind of microtransaction. This is made even more egregious than you might think on its face, because some of the weapons in the game receive infinite ammo when you use one of these tickets. Furthermore, in order to unlock everything in the game, you are expected to get the best possible grade while beating the game on Professional. This requires you to beat it under a certain amount of time while using only one save per chapter. Infinite ammo trivializes this and the only way to get a full playthrough with infinite ammo is to buy one of the tickets. I can't think of a more scummy thing to put in a single player game, especially when the original game did not contain those types of requirements to unlock everything. If this is a dealbreaker for you, I understand. It's a good thing, then that the rest of this game is incredible.

You might have read this far and thought ""Why is this review positive? It sounds like he hates this game."" On the contrary, they have done such an incredible job in every other aspect of remaking the original game that I still wholeheartedly recommend that you play this game yesterday. Especially if you loved the original, but you'll still love this even if you hadn't. It has been expanded and some of the content from the OG game ended up in the Separate Ways DLC. I do not have any issue with this. The DLC is awesome and a cut above the original Separate Ways in the OG RE4.

The engine that Capcom uses to make these games is stunning. Every single game they have developed in it from Dragon's Dogma to Monster Hunter and Devil May Cry is just an absolutely beautiful feast for the eyes and Resident Evil 4 is no exception. The music is perfect for the game. I even sometimes put the save room theme on loop to go to sleep or just to lay down and think. 

The combat has been greatly updated. It is fun, fast paced, and challenging. Playing on harder difficulties will test your limits. Getting S rank on Professional without the weapon upgrade tickets is truly an incredible test of your gaming prowess. Not for the faint of heart.

The story of this game is pretty cheesy. But they have put in a lot of work to make it feel at least a little less so. The OG has the charm of a silly B-movie that I will always cherish, but I don't disagree at all with the shift in tone. It has some really great characters with interesting personalities and I think I might be in love with Ada Wong. Leon also takes a few moments to check in with Ashley and make sure she is okay along the way. Something he did not do in the original. So even though this is about being a secret agent that goes to some other country to rescue a kidnapped daughter of the president, you will soon forget how ridiculous that is and get invested in the story.

So, altogether, despite some business practices that I vehemently disagree with, I can only recommend this game wholeheartedly. I love it.",True,0,1125

It was more map exploration than action, as you had to find a specific item, run across the map, insert an item, realize that the next puzzle requires you to run across the map again, and the cycle continues.

Once you get past this initial point, the game accelerates with somewhat better puzzles, action, and enemies. More characters are introduced, you reach the peak of the story and gameplay, and you should have enough money to buy and try various things. Puzzles require more thinking power, and it becomes less of a treasure hunt but still on par with that.

I did not really enjoy the demo, but I enjoyed the game as a whole. Definitely a step up to the other RE games I've tried.",True,0,1498
Resident Evil 4,2050650,205211197,"[b]tl;dr: The original is better, didn't sneak gambling into the game after reviews.[/b]

[h1]The Long (but necessary) Preamble[/h1]
I was hyped for RE2RE. I put Hours into the Demo alone.
For a while, it met my expectations. I hadn't thought too deeply into many aspects of and surrounding it.

Then RE3RE, which was 1/3rd the game. It put a [b]very[/b] sour taste in my mouth, because I Expected Capcom To Be Greedy [b]Again[/b] and FELL for it anyways.

As much as I adore this IP, I also can't allow that to cloud my judgement as a consumer, the other half of the free market, the Sole regulator of it. A logo is a logo. A Product is a Purchase.

I already found the DLC of RE2RE disgusting-
But it only got worse as [i]users would attempt Honest to God Library Spreads[/i] as if that was hustle culture, and [i]they'd Lose Every Time.[/i] There's something sad about that, someone Definitely Struggling, Definitely Younger, desperate to own Anything, hoping this stupid Steam Library means something because a Home won't be in their future. The idea someone barely better off than them, respecting themselves enough to call out anti-consumer practices, it's just Foreign to them. Their self-worth is tied into these soul-sucking products that barely resemble the imaginative ever evolving world of gaming 15-20 years ago.

It's Depressing. The old guard lost, there's at least 2 generations of kids who have only known deliberately incomplete products and proudly hired aid towards giving them gambling addictions.

RE4 came with Seperate Ways [b]For Free.[/b]
Little excuse for greedy behavior. Graphics are not a good reason, the game is not fundamentally more complicated to deserve a Double Price Increase from the original, and no, game prices from the NES-N64 don't count. 
To simplify: Nintendo controlling manufacturing which lead to companies like Atari getting pissed and trying to supersede it, publishers went to Sega because of this, who had lower prices. Discs dramatically furthered lowering costs, Digital Distribution cut that in half, games today should cost FAR less with easier tools, reusable assets, so much information, guaranteed sales, Streak Record Breaking Profits these same developers call disappointing.

Understand this is my Third Rodeo, I can Only Hope some kid sees this, understands they're not lesser of a person for not being able to afford a home, that it's okay to be proud of your games, don't believe it gives you greater value, it just means Mom's Credit Card does alot, that's fine, we were all young.

[h1]Onto the REview:[/h1]

RE4RE has moments where things just Work, but better than the OG?

Another pre-amble, as RE4OG normally, controls rather poorly.

So I'm discussing the (rather small) RE4_Tweaks mod for RE4OG, if you've played with it, you understand why.
THIS, is RE4, pushing boundaries of mechanics to go faster, confident in execution, back to back gameplay. Satisfying gameplay that makes you feel like Wesker without the drugs!

It's not utilized as much as I'd like, but you could barricade doors, then shoot holes through them, it's not used outside of [b]one[/b] missable section, but it's there! Could be expanded upon?

The crows! I love how they're treated like a Crate but moves! It's moving items! Memory, much like with OG RE1-3, IS REWARDED! Replayability!

The treasures? Almost always along your path, makes repeat playthroughs rewarding just remembering there's a treasure in one of the flame lamps without going out of my way.

The Inventory management? That is what DEFINED RE4 for me, it's STILL a unique mechanic, there's nothing more refreshing than adjusting your inventory, it even mattered how much you could carry at anytime, it wasn't mindless how you set it up!
Real consideration by the player for something personal, lovely!

[h1]The Actual REview[/h1]

I've completed all difficulty modes. Not on here. I was weak and got this on sale, supporting an anti-consumer company. It happens, we're all Pay Piggy Useful Idiots at times.
Just think, this sale would be meaningless 10 years ago when ""patient gamers"" became a wider thing. Now it's a big sale! Hooray 40% off! 20$... off... oh.

[b]RE4RE has a Very Rough Beginning,[/b] I'd argue the game only gets good the second After Ashley gets taken away the first time, second half isn't too bad. It's almost fun! When it wants to be.

[b]RE4RE is not a remake of RE4.[/b]
Re-imagining on a budget for gameplay. If this was a remake of RE4, they'd understand the Back To Back nature the original ALMOST had, that a modder easily fixed. They'd see potential, and adapt that, not discard it completely.
Instead, this game will have Leon play Long Animations that have few I-Frames, which is Dreadful for anything trying to be RE4.

RE4 has an unspoken mechanic that makes it Gold. When you do something, climb a ladder, vault a fence, you're invincible for a short while. Does this Look Realistic? No, but it's fun that the [b]Entire Environment[/b] actually plays some significance to the gameplay. 
It wasn't some guaranteed never get hit mechanic, you still had to Think.

RE4RE doesn't have this. It has Some I-Frames, mostly for melee, but generally you'll try to kick a ladder down, instead, Leon jumps into a crowd of enemies, spends 1.7 seconds to do his land animation, a .5 period before you regain control, then gets shoved around, dies because this game doesn't understand fun or control. God forbid I have any control to make my own fun in a moshpit.
realism. it feels...bad?

[b]Stealth[/b]
It tries to introduce Stealth, but it's infrequent, so slow that failure means you won't try it again. There's one section you can break by going a different way than intended, even then you can still stealth the intended way despite the enemies able to see you. 
It's just not an addition. It's Filler.

So gameplay is a bust from the start, they messed up crows, and treasures are a bore to find.
Inlaying gemstones is fun though, A+.
What of the new mechanics?

[b]Parrying[/b] is not a fun mechanic.
You're better off getting a mod.
Half the time it keeps you from a game over you could Not Possibly Avoid. Otherwise it's as bad as Jill's Dodge mechanic in RE3RE, it doesn't work, but they designed most of the game around it. If you like it, great, it should've been Intuitive, maybe treated as cool points, not a requirement.

[b]Dodging[/b] is the other half of Parry, it's even worse, the keybinds are hardlocked in ways that are user hostile and don't allow you to change a control that is already binded to another, unless [i]They Themselves have done it.[/i]
Which is infantile, it means they could, but refused your ability. 

Dodge could be C, CTRL, E, or F, depending on what you set your Use and Crouch buttons to be, meaning you Have to give up a leg to dodge.

[b]Movement[/b] Leon is Drunk and can't turn without a full half circle approach, gets stuck alot.

Compounding this comes another flawed mechanic, Bullet Spray.
Why in gods name did they add Bullet Spray.
Skill and Effort to RNG.

Charms are abhorrent. I hate having to swap around 8 charms every time I go to the merchant and leave. Awful. Could've been cool, but Micros.

[b]Gameplay Conclusion:[/b]
You're expected to Dodge, Parry and Aim, and all of it is RNG based or unintuitive, meanwhile the game's controls fight you, half taking away control and half not not taking your inputs. And then they have a shooting gallery with gambling mechanics tied into microtransactions snuck in after reviews.

Ashley is fundamental proof they did not playtest her. There's 0 reason for her.

[h1]Conclusions(mostly in comments)[/h1]
I've not much else to say. This isn't an unlovable game, but it's not a game you can fix either. Befriend it, don't stick your dick in it, stick your dick in RE4, it's old enough, I think... yeah 20 years old let's go I'm old AAAAAA",False,3,1984

What makes it stand out is Leon — he’s not the nervous rookie anymore, but cocky, confident, and surprisingly funny. I loved seeing how his character had changed, and even when he’s mowing down enemies like a one-man army, he still manages to make me laugh.

The cast around him is great too. Ashley has been rewritten into someone who isn’t just a burden, and she even manages to tug at your heart a little. Luis is lighthearted, fun, and such a good presence that it hurt to lose him when he died. And Mike, the helicopter pilot who swoops in to help, was such a high point — which made it sting all the more when his helicopter went down. Ada never clicked with me, but it's fine, i'm not the audience here, she's the seductive character for the boys. And the rest of the characters more than made up for it.

What really seals it is the mix of atmosphere and action. The setting is eerie and tense, but the game still finds ways to be fun and over-the-top. The bosses are wild and memorable, and even for someone like me who usually hates boss fights, I found myself enjoying them. The resource management, puzzles, and survival tension are still there, but RE4 layers in this crazy, entertaining energy that makes it unlike anything else in the series.

✨ Good Parts
Well i Like the lore the character designs Adas Clothes and i like the main antagonist 
(i have that nickname everywhere) and i like the Leon Scot Kennedy if i was girl i would deff fell love with that guy and i can say that i like everything in Whole resident evil
⚠️ Bad Parts
I Cant say anything about bad parts only thing i can say is i have trauma on Regenerator from resident evil 4 original

The game is also very, very pretty, the RE engine really does produce some fine scenery and overall looks, and the performance was also nice, it runed ok. The game shows its age in the gameplay and the overall feel of it, feels very basic—go there, pick this bring it back, etc, and moving the character also feels super clunky, but that's to be expected from such an old game.

The nostalgia hit me right in the childhood. I played the OG RE4 back when I was a kid, and this remake feels like Capcom broke into my memories, polished them up, and cranked everything to 11.

Resident Evil is my favourite franchise of all time, Resident Evil 4 was one of the best games in said franchise, and this remake modernises the controls, and fixes the gripes the 2005 PC port has, to give a solid 10/10 experience. This is the ultimate experience, and really showcases with 7, Village, and REmake 2 just how much of a rebirth this franchise has recieved. 

This game is the perfect survival horror game, and is a love letter to a masterpiece, and the genre.

- This game definitely speaks to the Chud fantasy, Raccoon city has fallen, billions have become infected and you're the President's top guy to save his daughter. 
-The President's daughter is very likable, Although her AI could've been better.
-The atmosphere and visuals are top notch. A spooky rustic Spanish town infested by a plague that has turned them into mindless cultists.
-Gun play is fun
-Leon is a cool, likable and an interesting character, And I Like his character development from a naive young cop in the 2nd game to a hardened special forces unit we see in this game.

The bad:
-Everything about Ada Wong is frustrating, She is an annoying girl boss and adds nothing of value to the story. She has as much personality as a plank of wood and is nothing more than the result of garbage feminist wokery garbage that's all too common in video games nowadays. I'm glad they didn't try a romantic angle between her and Leon; although it is somewhat implied, A Useless character except to throw a bone for the rice bunny lovers
-Some enemies are bullet sponges
- This game puts various characters in life and death situations, Why are they quipping like this is some cringe Marvel movie? dumb writing and unnecessary, It breaks immersion at times.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,204652825,"Alright, story time.
I can't remember if I ever reviewed the original on here, but I did have some choice words about it back when I played. Not the biggest of RE4, just opening with that as a preface.
Naturally, I had to play the remake, and my judgement is so:
If this had to be compared to one of the previous two remakes, it's more akin to Resident Evil 2 Remake (rere2 for short). It contains most of the story beats and visuals, but often lacks context for them and are just essentially member-berries. Though the game does have some general gameplay improvements from original, it also has glaring flaws, such as the RE Engine games' lovely ""stand still to shoot or your accuracy goes down by 90%"", and the most absolute brainlette of a decision to make the effing survival knife breakable AGAIN, *as well* as take up *three* slots in your briefcase. Even better is that the game really expects you to have that knife handy at all times despite it shattering every two seconds, so I get killed by things like the spiny regenerators and the game has the gall to go ""oi m8, you need to use your knife when they grab ya or they'll kill ya instantly"" and I'm just like ""OH, REALLY? JUST. USE ME KNIFE? GEE, I WOULD DO THAT, BUT THE THING FUCKING BROKE AND THE DEMON GRABBED ME FROM ACROSS THE ROOM AND I COULD DO LITERALLY NOTHING TO COUNTER IT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DOESN'T SYNC WITH ITSELF"".
Now, unlike last time, however, I don't think this was made to sell the Infinite Ammo DLC™ as enemies aren't bullet sponges like they were in ReRe2, which is good because the game likes to drown you in enemies, which halts the game to a stop because everything group pulls in an area and you can't do anything until you've killed all 20+ Ganados or whatever. Plus, they brought back the bowgun for this game (but not rere2 for some reason?), and it's GOATed because of all the enemies that come often out of literal nowhere (had moments where my back was to an empty room and I still get ganked because the game director spawned some goobs in there), letting you reclaim your bolts...if the game doesn't glitch out. I've had plenty of instances where if you shoot an enemy in their death animation, the bolt is just erased from existence.
The game has a lot of segments and context for things cut out, I've noticed. The entire gondola segment, the canyon monster, Salazzar becoming a monster out of nowhere with his one minion he fuses with in the original just ...not appearing in this episode (he was previously seen in the throne room scene). like, half of the final island.
On a final note, the voice acting. Generally, it's pretty decent. Leon's spot-on, Luis is good, Ashley...doesn't sound like Ashley, but her new voice is okay. But Ada Wong? No. To call her VA a Voice Actor would be too generous. Whoever was hired to voice her should not return. The best I can describe is that got someone's disinterested Aunt into the recording booth and had her mumble out her lines because they ran out of budget or something. Every line Ada utters is just merely read out. There is no acting. And she doesn't even *remotely* sound like Ada Wong.
I guess you can she sounds....wong.",True,0,2302

Gloria a las plagas! Pero vivir es playing the original other than this soulless husk.

This remake, despite looking somewhat decent in graphical terms, completely fails to capture the atmosphere, overall vibe and horror elements that the original had. The art direction from Resident Evil 4, which is responsible for the absolute masterpiece it used to be, just wasn't followed. The remake doesn't replicate the ambiance, foggy weather, dirty looking aesthetic. Lighting is just modernized, visuals look realistic rather than stylistic. Lacks the tension we used to feel back in the day even when there were no enemies around. Basically enshittified Resident Evil 4... The original has small things nobody appreciates until they're gone. Crickets, wind sounds, sometimes even weather effects aren't present at the same locations, not immersing the player as much as before.

If there's positive things to say about the remake, is that it's superbly well optimized. There's some CPU problems, but it runs pretty fine at 60fps on slightly older PC builds few years older than its release date. There's tons of graphical settings to mess around with, so getting good performance shouldn't be impossible. Separate Ways was a welcome addition, adding further lore and gameplay, as Ada this time. Nothing to write home about however. Movement is leagues better than in the OG: WASD controls rather than tank controls truly make a difference.

Back to how it plays out: certain moments and many cutscenes were changed to accommodate the new level redesigns, sometimes taking away from RE4's personality, like Leon having a cut on his cheek after the Krauser fight for the rest of the game, which doesn't happen here. Several location edits were done, not necessarily for the best, but rather just for the sake of being ""remade"", to better showcase the technological leap. Again, not exactly to improve on the original.

RE4R just isn't worth it. It's universally loved, but at the end of the day, it's nothing but mob mentality gobbling up fan service.",False,7,6093

Resident Evil 4,2050650,204621458,"Even without nostalgia for the original Resident Evil 4, this remake completely won me over. It delivers an experience that, for me, feels even better than the RE2 and RE3 remakes.

Combat is the highlight: smooth gunplay, a satisfying variety of weapons, and boss fights that are both fun and challenging. Even the breakable knife, which I disliked at first, eventually grew on me.

The story is solid, but the atmosphere and map design really stand out. Each region feels distinct, and the side quests and shooting range add variety, even if they aren’t particularly memorable.

This remake leans more into action than survival horror. It’s fun, but it sometimes reduces the tension and resource management that define classic survival horror.

Overall, this remake strikes a great balance between action and survival horror. With its thrilling combat, memorable enemies, and impressive atmosphere, it’s easily one of the best Resident Evil experiences — 8.5/10.",True,0,1287

Resident Evil 4,2050650,204482010,"Resident Evil 4 was already a legend, but this remake doesn’t just honor the original – it redefines it. I went in with high expectations, but what I got was an unforgettable experience that reminded me why I fell in love with survival horror in the first place.

From the moment Leon sets foot in that eerie Spanish village, the game grabs you with its atmosphere. The lighting, the sound design, the way the environments feel alive – everything builds tension and keeps you on edge. Every creak of a floorboard, every distant scream, every glimpse of a shadow makes you second-guess whether you’re ready for the next step forward.

The characters feel richer and more human this time around. Leon is still the witty, unshakable agent we know, but now he carries himself with a little more weight, more weariness. Ashley is no longer just an escort mission – she’s a believable, sympathetic companion. And the villains… grotesque, unforgettable, and terrifyingly real.

Gameplay is a perfect balance of action and horror. Gunplay feels punchy and rewarding, inventory management is just as tense and satisfying as ever, and the redesigned encounters are brilliantly paced. Every fight feels like survival – not just shooting. The remake respects the DNA of the original but modernizes it in a way that makes it feel fresh and exciting without losing what made it special.

On top of that, the visuals are breathtaking. The RE Engine has never looked better, from the dripping rain on Leon’s jacket to the grotesque details of every monster. The soundtrack hits hard, too – haunting when it needs to be, explosive when the action kicks in.

When the credits rolled, I didn’t just feel like I’d replayed a classic. I felt like I’d lived through a new experience that stood on its own, even while paying tribute to the past. Resident Evil 4 Remake is not just a faithful recreation – it’s a masterpiece of modern horror.",True,0,18938

If the 2005 original was a revolution, the 2023 remake is the cathedral built on its battlefield.

Funny Things:
If a creepy villager whispers ‘¡Detrás de ti, imbécil!’, it is already too late you are about to get yeeted across the village square like a sack of potatoes.

The Merchant is the only man in Spain who can sell you a rocket launcher in the middle of a swamp at 3 a.m. and make it feel normal.

Ashley’s ‘Leon, help!’ is the official soundtrack of panic.

She can’t climb a ladder without assistance, but can survive being carried off by a 7 foot cultist like it’s a casual Uber ride.

In RE4, you will break into a villager’s home, steal their ammo, eat their eggs raw, and still feel like you are the victim.

Nothing says ‘survival horror’ like stopping mid-battle to solve a sliding tile puzzle while a parasite monster waits politely.",True,71,6399
Resident Evil 4,2050650,204337894,"Phenomenally fun, packed with content, somehow gets even better on subsequent playthroughs. With the way it carries over from one difficulty to the next, I've never been more satisfied with NewGame+. Difficulty ramps up massively, but there are crazy powerful weapons and upgrades that carry over with you, making it an entirely different experience. Once you start aiming for the best unlocks through the greatest challenges (e.g. beat the game with only pistols and knives), the challenge comes back to meet your newfound mastery. None of this is unique to this entry, but I do feel its done best in RE4.

Is it my favorite Resident Evil game? Maybe. That is a very hard question, which is really just a testament of how great the franchise is as a whole. It isn't the scariest, it's a complete re-imagining that somewhat lacks the benefit of nostalgia, and is overall very different from the original, let alone the other RE games. And yet I’ll say that it is probably the most entertaining.

This being a horror game with an action-star protagonist is pretty impressive as it maintains the horror, creepiness, and grotesque perfectly well. Didn’t scare me like some of the others, but it left a lasting impression to say the least.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,204276710,"The Resident Evil 4 Remake is not just a faithful reimagining of a beloved classic — it's a triumph in modern game design that masterfully blends nostalgia with innovation. Capcom has managed to preserve the heart-pounding tension and iconic moments of the 2005 original, while refining every aspect to meet today’s standards.

From the opening village ambush to the chilling depths of the castle and island, the game is a non-stop thrill ride. The graphics are stunning, with richly detailed environments, realistic lighting, and character models that breathe new life into Leon, Ashley, and even the nightmarish Ganados. The atmosphere is thick with dread, and yet, it never loses that pulpy charm that made the original so memorable.

Gameplay-wise, everything has been tuned to near perfection. The over-the-shoulder shooting is tighter and more satisfying than ever, and the addition of modern mechanics — such as stealth options, improved knife combat, and crafting — enhance the experience without diluting the essence of what made RE4 great. The pacing is spot-on, balancing action, exploration, and suspense beautifully.

Leon Kennedy’s witty one-liners are still intact, and Ashley has been reworked into a much more engaging and less frustrating companion. The story is more cohesive, with deeper character moments and a darker, more grounded tone that still knows when to lean into its campy roots.

Whether you're a die-hard Resident Evil fan or a newcomer to the series, Resident Evil 4 Remake is an essential experience. It respects its legacy while confidently stepping into the future — a benchmark for how remakes should be don",True,0,5831

Resident Evil 4,2050650,204150688,"THIS game is the leading champion of how a remake should be ! Everything was improved !! Let me break it down:
- Graphics - let's get the obvious out of the way. the models, the lighting, the background all dialled up. For some odd reason, my brain thinks it's not so different, until I watch comparison videos.

- the characters: this is my biggest surprise. Yes they've improved with new scans of real life models, but here is the thing; the writing improved too ! Ashley in particular, becomes prettier and more likeable. She shouts and screams in fear realistically, like you just want to protect her. She's vulnerable, but courageous also. OG Ashley was all over the place, imo. Too bratty. The new voice actress did a muuuch better job. Same goes with Leon and Luis, I think.

- the writing: the core of the story is the same, but how it plays is a little different. It's cinematically improved, not sure how else to describe it. Things make more sense here, and less campy.

- gameplay: the OG was already revolutionizing this aspect. The remake is simply perfecting it. Some extra stuff like the new parry system adds flavour to an already yummy dish. New puzzles, completely redesigned areas are all welcomed. The suplex is back, baby !!

Considering how beloved RE4 is the devs have gone out of their way to really show their love for it also, the music is familiar, many of the challenges are named after Leon's cheesy one-liners, and the locations have been so lovingly recreated that the whole game feels totally familiar whilst still presenting a brand new experience.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203995363,"I have a lot of nostalgia for the original RE4 and due to that I was initially a bit reluctant to try the Remake, both because I felt that a remake is not necessary and that I didn't want to be biased towards it. However, after finally having played it, it's a great game.

The atmosphere is in-line with Resident Evil 2 Remake (but of course, more action focused) and the gameplay is very well-designed. The island is just as menacing and iconic as it was in the original, and almost every single thing is kept intact. The inclusion of modern controls does make the game more fun and less clunky to play, which is something I appreciate. And the graphics, of course, are amazing as usual with the line of Remake games in the franchise (yes, even RE1R).

I do have a few issues with the new personalities for the side characters/antagonists and some of the visual design choices - but they're minor and don't get in the way of how fun this game is. I wouldn't recommend playing the original over this to newer players and can accept it as a decent replacement.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203994572,"After 70 hours of playing, yeah I had a lot of fun.  Been a long time since i've done multiple playthroughs for a game.
Its a lot more action-heavy, RE4 was the one that started the trend of Resident Evil games becoming more action as time went on before they pivoted back to horror in RE7.   But man is this game still fun to play.   Great pacing, great action, great atmosphere. 
There's something charming with them being more serious compared to the original RE4 but still keeping some of the more outlandish stuff.  Like Leon occasionally roundhouse kicking a villager or doing flips.  He's still makes his dry humor one-liners but in a more ""welp, time to deal with this BS"" kind of delivery which I like.
Leon is basically a Metal Gear character at this point.   Some parts of the game even reminds me of Metal Gear, especially in the final chapters when you reach the Island. 

I would sometimes play the original 05 version, mainly just to see the differences and how much as changed in the almost two decade difference, thats crazy to think about.
There are some aspects that I wish they kept in but I think the remake did an outstanding on job at expanding some areas that were lacking in the original or replacing with something else to help with the pacing more.  
Music however is a lot more better in the original.  Luckily there is an option to enable classic sfx, mainly for menu interface and music.  

Mods also definitely helps with replayability.  Favorite one, and one I highly recommend if you're looking to go through another playthrough, is the classic RE4 laser mod available at Nexus.  Makes the gameplay feel like a hybrid of classic and modern RE4, just make sure to pair with the classic enemy stagger mod as well.

This is definitely one of the rare times I'd call a game 10/10.  Really curious on how they're gonna handle an RE5 remake, if there's even gonna be one.   Though lots of rumors that Code Veronica might be the next one to be remade.",True,0,4916

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203985818,"The best remake out of Resi 2, 3 and 4. This is an absolute masterpiece and a must have in any Resi fan's collection.

Gameplay is slower than the OG Resi 4 which I prefer as it makes you more vulnerable and makes timing more important with reloads, parries and dodges. Boss and mini boss fights have been tweaked. Most remain similar but some got an overhaul such as Ramon, though I have to admit I kind of missed the OG Resi 4 Ramon fight and the setting for it. The strong threat fights as well as the requests for the merchant were also a nice touch. However having the Punisher only purchasable via the Spinels challenge system when it was free in the OG Resi was a bit of a kick in the teeth.
The weapon system is brilliant as each gun feels like it has its own merits and it doesn't mean guns you get later are a straight upgrade to the ones you have, I'm looking at you Resi Village. The one exception was the handcannon which is 1/3 bonus weapons you can get. It's the hardest to unlock and is a straight downgrade to the Broken Butterfly in my opinion and isn't worth the effort.
One of the few complaints I had with the OG Resi 4 was atmosphere because along with the faster pace gameplay and quick time events with fairly comfortable reaction windows it felt like the Resi franchise was moving away from horror and more towards action hence Resi 5 & 6. This remake along with the Resi 2 & 3 remakes and Resi 7 solidifies the direction of travel is horror (Can't wait for Requiem) and I'm here for it. The general tone is darker and along with the gameplay that leaves you more vulnerable it really gets the heart pumping. Every time a scene plays to introduce a new special enemy you can feel a shift in the pixelated air and you're excited and dreading what's around the corner. 
The graphics bring a legendary entry in the Resi franchise to a more modern era. The RE Engine has shown its time is not up which given it was created in 2014 is an incredible feat. Lighting which is so important in horror games was used to great effect where even during the day you can feel the tension and in dark scenes the game came into its own. Sound design was on point, again another vital part to any horror game, with each creak and screech making your heart skip a beat. 
This review is quite late so the game will be on sale fairly often with each season so the pricing is a bargain when it's on sale but for the OG price of £34.99 this game was still more than worth it and I can't recommend it enough. You simply won't regret it.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203764716,"Great remake of an already great game.

RE4 is a fantastic experience, being revolutionary back in the early 2000s, and this remake stays mostly true to its vision while streamling some of the less enjoyable sections and adding some. Some content is missing but is part of it is restored in the Separate Ways campaign DLC, which I also recommend getting.

The dialogue has better writing for the most part but it lost some of the camp and more edgy lines by Leon, a sign of the times unfortunately.
The soundtrack serves the game well, being a mix of the original with new tracks, though the lack of ambient music/soundscape for moody scenes (such as the church during the thunderstorm) definitely makes it lackluster compared to the original in this regard. It's something you'll probably won't notice at first but comparing the two it's evident this remake is more ""quiet"" overall.

Tech-wise, it looks good but requires a decent PC to run well and not be an eyesore (RX 6600/RTX 3060 for 1080p at least). The dithering is still present as well as some aliasing that TAA can mask a bit at the cost of sharpness. Speaking of sharpness, FSR 2 has a horrible implementation here, looking softer than FSR 1 and Interlaced. If you're looking for more frames, I suggest switching rendering mode to Interlaced (Capcom's version of checkerboard rendering) which does a decent job and looks better than previous RE Engine games in the series.

The story is full of the cheesy dialogue that Resident Evil is known for but is a really fun ride. This one expands on so many mechanics from the first few and it is quite difficult not to call this one the best of the franchise.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203650880,"Amazing remake and Resident Evil installation in the franchise. 

Played on standard and it was generous with ammunition and healing items, imo.
This game felt more action focused than the previous installments, like RE2 remake, which gave me scraps to resources (I was just bad at managing them lol+ It was a lot more resource- management focused and you couldn't go ham on every creature in your vicinity unless you wanted to be left with absolutely nil items in the middle of the game.)

I liked the concept of The Merchant to buy, sell, upgrade, and repair stuff, as well as complete request. However, one request I found so hard, because the lab-creatures were a pain to deal with, and at that point in the game, I didn't have enough ammunition to complete the request...

Game had me going Rambo with all my utility.

Games like these, feel nostalgic to play with controller, as they intended for the original Resident Evil games, however, this optimisation for controller for this game was horrendous. The auto-lock aiming feature was so buggy and inaccurate that I switched to KnM immediately. Kinda disappointed because playing survival- horror and story games like these always feels more cozy and like the good-ol-days with controller.

Loved every second of it from the start. RE4 is what you get if you mix the puzzles & backtracking of RE2 and the (sometimes over the top) action of RE3. 
What's especially good about this game is the total package that you get. The level design, the story & characters, action sequences. The only thing I think that could be better were the puzzles. They're not as braindead simple as the ones in RE3, but they are a bit too easy sometimes. But besides of that one little critique, this is (again) some fantastic work delivered by Capcom.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203624404,"Better than Alan Wake 2, that's one thing I will say. (Survival horror)

One thing I do not like about this game is point of no returns. If you miss something you will have to do a mandatory NG+ which sucks.

RE4 I just started CH.6 and so far it's different from the past RE games. Which is why I said survival horror up above. RE2 RE3 and some RE games from before aren't like this one. This one still has puzzles and quirks from the past games, but it's so far different. This is based on all the way to the end of CH.5. It may or may not shift back to the usual. 

So far it's a solid 8/10. -1 for the no point of return. For some sections of the game there should be ways to go back at least. The castle area kind of did that. 

The game is a solid 8.5. Part of the game made me not sell stuff so I can upgrade, once you get bugs that drop blue jewels keep at least 3 (5 if you feel it's too little) on hand and sell the rest, trust me, like seriously. You will have so much more room to work with on upgrading your main weapons. 

The quest tracking was 💩 there was 1 medallion left and I couldn't go back, it literally didn't even show. I didn't get achievement for it. I don't really care about achievements, but that, it just annoys me. 

Performance, all the way to the end of 15 was 👍literally no problems. I'm surprised my system handled this game on 1440p with pretty much high on all. not max. CPU: 5800x GPU:RX 5700
However, during chapter 16 the last chapter my performance started dropping. I was getting frame drops/stutters whichever. Not the whole time, but frequently, both cutscenes and non cutscenes. 

This brings the game to an 8.5. The achievements and that performance drop didn't affect the score. The DLC will not bring the score up, but will stay as 8.5/10. On to playing it. It didn't improve the score, it would actually make me drop the score if I were to include it as a whole game. The upgrades, lockouts in areas and somewhat progression in areas, weapons and etc. was not the best imo. (quests were kind of 💩) The quests actually felt like they ruined the pacing, the pacing was actually not the greatest besides the quest. I did like Ada though.

Overall, I did have a good time with the game. A change of pace and besides the stutters on the game towards the end (which may have been my system screwing up) the performance was amazing. (Will be doing a small break and getting back to it soon) RE5 is next!",True,0,2101

Although it's a good game, at the end of the day, the controls are clunky and it's dumbed down for ""the modern audience"". And Ashley is still the worst companion ever...

Compared to the OG, the plot is toned down a lot but it's still the same old goofy plot. And personally, this is the main reason why I don't like RE4 as much as others because this is the exact entry where the plot in every campaign has started to get too goofy.

The controls are very similar to those of RE2 Remake and I loved them back there as they are a perfect fit for a survival-horror title. However, since RE4 is more action-ey, they just fall clunky for an action game. The aiming is slow. The movement and running are slow. Th FOV isn't great. Parry and dodge windows are tight... It rather felt like playing DSR in 2025 but with guns instead. In addition, they should have implemented parry and dodge mechanics properly instead of relying them on QTEs.

Lastly, the dumbing down all over the place felt like an insult to my intelligence like the infamous excessive usage of yellow paint (which became a meme over time) and giving vocal hints as soon as you go in a wrong direction or try to open a different door (just like GoW 2018)",True,1,1490

I must admit that way back when there were rumours of this game, I was not really excited about the idea of a RE4 remake as I thought there wasn't much Capcom could do with this game like they were able to with 2 and 3, but after playing this, I'm glad to see that I was proven wrong. This is a remake that offers an exciting experience for both newcomers and RE veterans.

The remake feels both distinct and yet familiar, providing a unique experience from the original. It offers a lot of useful updates and new QOL to the game (especially with Ashley), and plenty of additions that add to the meal. The graphics, environment and art style are beautifully designed, and it really feels like a breath of fresh air. The new areas were well-designed, and I enjoyed my time exploring them.

Inventory System: I would definitly go for RE4's inventory system. It feels less punishing to save ammo, the key items are seperated from the inventory which feels satisfying. You almost never run out of space unless you are explicitly trying to do so.

Exploration: This game clearly has more exploration than RE2R has. whenever you see a yellow box, you kick it. It's that simple yet so satisfying to do. Puzzle-wise, RE2R has more puzzles and they feel more rewarding. The game pushes you to keep exploring and running back and forth to unlock previously locked places. (Which could have been a better experience if running wasn't so slow)

Combat: RE4R definitly wins the cake here with much dynamic and diverse combat mechanics. An actual dodging system i wished RE2R had. Ran out of ammo? no problem you can just craft more. 

Story: Both games satisfied me with their stories, however... RE2R felt repetetive after finishing Leon's story.

About a year ago I saw a speedrun of RE4 Remake and was actually pretty impressed but I didn't think of it any further.
This summer I was bored and had nothing to play and I saw RE4 on sale and I pulled the trigger - and I was instantly hooked!
I soon beat the game on Professional S+ and then did the same with Separate Ways, and recently I got the last achievement! Very good value for money!!!
I've since also bought, and S+'ed RE2, RE3 and RE Village and although I find the ""aim over the shoulder"" weird the story and the puzzles outweigh any criticism.
RE4 Remake is my absolute favourite in the series and I only wish there were more Leon Kennedy games...

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203353223,"Even better than you remember it being. I've completed the original Resident Evil many times, from the original GameCube to Wiimote controls .... every other version was great, but this is the best one. They really took their time and gave it polish. There are so many memorable setpieces and it's a blast from start to finish, from fighting jaws to the minecart shootout. Some of the new sidequest stuff is pure filler, but it's optional and whenever I felt like it was about to slow down the pace of the game I skipped it. Stopping right before a boss fight to go chase down 4 rats? Nah actually, I'm good.

The game is more scary and atmospheric than the original, with more detail put into certain sections and puzzles. Gameplay wise it feels very similar, but with the modern polish you'd expect; You can move and shoot now, and the knife plays more of a role with knife parrying, but newly-limited endurance. Overall it's a fresh spit-shine on a classic game that makes it worth playing through again. If you've never played the original? Then you're in for a treat.

I am running a 4090 though, but even without ray tracing it looks incredible. Enough has changed that more than once I was caught off guard, but then again, I hadn't played through the game in probably 15 years. A lot of the same old tricks that worked in the OG still work here. If you've never played a Resident Evil game, or are sensitive to scares, this is a great one to start with. The RE2/3 remake are quite ""scary"". This one is just right. 
Everything feels really well tuned. The old tank controls are gone and replaced with something a bit more modern. There are some changes I didnt love, but got used to, like the knife having durability that diminishes and breaks after so much use. Another thing that was hard to get used to was the fact that your aiming reticle is no longer a laser sight, and is replaced with cross hairs. You still have the same kind of recoil and what not, but now you have to deal with bloom.

Of all RE remakes, RE 4 is definitely the most boring. 
It is nice to complete it a few times, but when the game locks rewards behind specific difficulty and specific setting and specific condition, forcing you to beat it multiple times, I genuinely lose interest. 
I made 7 main campaign playthroughs and 3 for its expansion. A bit too much. But hey, [u]if you don't care for the achievements, you'll play less! [/u]

[b]The best of 4th is...[/b]
Second part of the game - is the Castle with its dungeons, cannon siege and possessed knights episodes. Mini puzzle games with tiles, fancy giant halls and statues here and there... Hence the title of my review. 

I got a bit fed up with the Village part, where everyone grabs me and stabs me (certified skill issue, I admit). Dogs and bear traps were fun though. Them and checking trees for hanging lanterns with precious gems, exploring corners of a lake for extra resources. 
But once you reach the castle and have to face blind enemy with long metal claws, have to survive lurking knights and then travel across the mines, oof, yeah, it instantly outshines everything before and that's easily the best part of the RE 4.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3551629741
There's also a third part. The island with its regenerative enemies, giant biomass and QTE (sort of) fights. Hmm... the same place felt more tense in the Separate Ways, but the main game you can easily stealth you way in. Which makes it 1 memorable area out of 3. Castle > Village > Island.

For me RE universe was always about just T-virus. But then RE Village introduced mold. Now, RE 4 disclosed some amber bugs. *shrugs in oblivion* It's cool the franchise expands, but for me, not a hardcore RE fan, it's getting confusing to follow ""who, where, when got infected, mutated and why"". All those beings (RE 4 bosses) clearly existed for a long time, yet haven't made connections, influences outside of their small area, nor draw attention to themselves, yet got impressive firepower and gear. Oh well. Not a biggie. 

RE 4 remake is a nice game, multiple replays are certainly for RE fans only. I'm glad I played it, but wish it didn't require so many completions. And why does it look worse than RE Village?",True,2,5333

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203316372,"A wonderful experience!

Unlike RE2 and RE3 which relied more on artificial difficulty by limiting your resources (giving you as few rounds of ammo as possible, have enemies that grab you practically automatically damage you...) this game relies a lot more on the action heavy sequences and gives you plenty of ways to kill your opponents as well as giving you ample resources for it. 

The story itself is truly nothing special, all things considered. Luis's involvement and his research on the Plaga and him being a determined force to stop Saddler within his laboratory is probably the best element. The fact Leon got himself out of plenty of situations, but for some he needed Ada to progress is also a nice touch. Wouldn't be a RE story without the best side characters dying, though...

The dialogue is hilarious, not as quip-y and raw as the original game, but still does a great job. 

The game itself looks fantastic, giving a fantastic look to ALL characters and enemies. Lighting is done just right, and despite the heavy focus on action and adventure and less on puzzles and horror, there're still elements that made me spooked and puzzled, particularly the lab where you discover the regenerating enemies, that section without power is fantastic horror, as well as many areas in the castle.

Voice acting is also on point. Some folks aren't a big fan of the Luis or Ada voices but I found them plenty enjoyable and very accurate. 

The game's plenty fun, has TONS of content, and if I ever choose to replay any RE game (which would only happen if I wanted a second, harder playthrough) it'd probably be this game.

Ninety-nine of our great british pound sterling, there was the chance for New York, Reykjavik, Warsaw, Sorrento and I ended up pulling 'Undescript spanish village'

What the frickle frackle?!

Anyways, the luggage allowance was tiny, only enough in my case to pack a gun, some healing spray and a couple of herbs which was bad enough but then the bus to my hotel was cancelled so the police gave me a ride into town. 

Anyways, the welcome was very unfriendly to say the least. The villagers attacked me on the spot and stole my jacket. Some doctor with a chainsaw really wanted to give me a vasectomy and the president of the united states' daughter latched onto me as I was the only other English speaker in the whole town. 

We checked out the local sights together and came across a castle on google maps that was rated 1.5 stars but considering the only other option was drink rusty tap water and get ran through by some crazy Abuela with a pitch fork, we figured it would be better than nothing. 

Major disappointment. The owner must have been home for the summer and let's just say he failed to inform us that tourists were no longer welcome until the fall season. He kept calling me 'Meeester Kennedy' even though my surname is Bobertson. Maybe the last US president he'd heard of was JFK and he assumed the president's daughter was a Kennedy and I was too?

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203235620,"TL:DR
This game is amazing, and perfects the original. Make sure to close all other programs on lower end computers in order to prevent crashes. I hate the way you get charms. The graphics can be pretty blurry, but unfortunately that seems to be a trend in modern graphics, like how the original was covered in sepia.

This game is absolutely excellent in nearly every way, and perfects the original, which I say as someone who has actually played the original (granted, on the Wii Xd). 
What the original already did well, this remake improves upon, and where the original faltered, this one at least makes the annoyance tolerable. While the more serious tone is certainly a change from the original, I can't help but feel that this helped the story shine in ways that the original couldn't. There was actual character development and depth in my silly Shooty Action Resident Evil! 
I do have one minor but incredibly frustrating criticism and one major criticism, which are the changes to the shooting gallery and the actual stability and graphical fidelity of this game.

Let this paragraph serve as a warning to new players about this mechanic, though do keep in mind that the rest of the game is still excellent. Basically, the system is a complete crapshoot, and it's entirely possible that you literally won't get anything but the same 3 common charms again and again and again. This is because the charm system isn't random each time you put in tokens, but instead is predetermined upon creating the new save, and only gives 8 charms for each token combination, distributed in linear fashion, and there will certainly be duplicates among any given combination. Also, the combinations using more gold tokens don't get better charms than the other combinations. I got almost all common charms the 4 times I put in three golds, and a legendary and epic, among various rares, from using three silvers. It's honestly impressive the devs managed to make something so inoffensive so frustrating. I do love listening to Ashely and Luis commenting on my performance though :)

This game is extremely intense on your system, to put it bluntly. I basically have just above the minimum specs to play this game, and while I am still able to squeeze some good graphics out of the game, I have to basically close everything else running at the same time to prevent crashes. Actually, I should put this in all caps for the overwhelming majority of you who don't read crazy long reviews. ON LOWER END COMPUTERS, CLOSE OTHER PROGRAMS BEFORE BOOTING. THIS SOLVES SOME CRASHING ISSUES. Even on high graphics settings, though, like most other modern triple A games, can be weirdly blurry, which is a pretty common problem when looking at the ground or dimly lit rooms. This seems to be a cost of business. On the upside, this game presents an incredible breadth of customization options in every facet of the game, and even provides examples of how your graphics settings will affect performance and the way the game itself looks. I adore this feature of the RE remakes, I cannot stress enough how awsome this is and how this should be the staple for all big budget games going forward.",True,0,1947
Resident Evil 4,2050650,203234769,"Personally my favorite REmake so far. A reimagining that doesn't stray horribly far from the original, superb graphics, incredibly engaging gameplay, and an Ashley that I generally wanted to protect this time around. Biggest problems to me were the loss of the cheesy action movie vibes from the original and Ada. Ada like most have stated sounds like a plank of wood and portions of the original game have been reworked where Leon no longer goes through them but Ada does instead.

Honestly loved pretty much every second of this game - it is really authentic to the original game which I started around a year ago. The encounters are not only action-packed but also terrifying, with the better graphics and new enemy designs creating truly gruesome monsters to fight.

I played the game on Assisted mode (which I regret severely!) and this was great for a first playthrough so I could get a story-focused game, however I think I could've managed Standard at least as the game was ridiculously easy - I would literally kill bosses in 4 shotgun shots.

Of course I also love the original story and all the characters, they really bring the people in the game to life and create some fairly emotional moments - special mention to the merchant who they did a great job at recreating within the game to be his usual dodgy self :)

EDIT: I have now played the Ada DLC ('Seperate Ways') and it is awesome as well! Made sure that I used different weapons in this run like the machine gun! The gameplay is fairly similar and same with the areas, but the different perspective provides enough interest for me :) There were also some new areas and many bosses which were awesome to fight, although I will say that the final boss of the the DLC is largely underwhelming :/ I played on Standard difficulty and this is definitely the best option as it is not ridiculously easy but it's not too hard either.

The action is perfect, the game is legitimately scary at times, the story is impeccable, the characters are AMAZING.  The puzzles are relatively simple but still interesting and makes backtracking fun and worthwhile. Leon Kennedy makes for a great protagonist, dropping iconic one-liners through the entire game, and still showing a legitimately caring side when it comes to Ashley. The added background with Leon and Krauser at the beginning, is seriously icing on the cake. Every addition from the original to the remake is so well thought out, and the entire game feels similar but is VERY different. I think this game is a MUST BUY, when it comes to games in general.

Dang, this is a disappointment. Been really looking forward to this.
Simply doesn't feel like Resident Evil. I loved 2 & 3 Remake, 7, Village. Might not even finish this one.

There's 0 atmosphere, especially not horror. You walk 5 meters, get swarmed by a braindead horde, barraging you with dynamite and thrown axes. Kill them (shoot, kick, repeat), collect loot, walk 5 meters -> rinse. repeat.

Resident Evil 4: Remake is a Remake of Resident Evil: Dead Aim.

You play as Leon Scott Kennedy, a former rookie in the Raccoon City Police Department turned secret service member for the United States Government. The Presidents daughter is kidnapped by a mysterious cult, and you have to be a bad enough dude to save her! 
Luckily, this time, Leon understands Spanish and can just ask his way around. But it doesn’t help because the evil cultist guys attack him with axes and knives and other sharp/blunt objects. 
So now, with nothing but 6 bullets, a knife, and the ability of Karate, Leon ventures further into this WORLD OF NIGHTMARES


Resident Evil: Beat Everyone’s Ass Edition, is a third person action shooter that pretends to be a horror game for maybe the first 40 minutes before you remember you can round house kick people’s heads clean off. 
You need to understand just how big of a deal the classic Resident Evil 4 was. It became a blueprint for games to come in the future, because apparently no one thought to put a camera over the character’s shoulder and let you aim with the R button (R1 if you played on Ps2. I don’t know what the Wii’s was, A, probably.) 

RE4 mixed high quality graphics with cool gunplay and quick time events that totally weren’t going to be overplayed in the future. It was this game where you could never take it easy because you could just flat out die in cutscenes if you did. 
Limb based damage was also a thing, shooting dude’s in the face or the knees set them up for some wicked melee attacks like a spin kick on a suplex. There was also a bunch of unlockables, a handful of completely separate campaigns involving Ada, and other neat stuff to keep you busy like MERCENARIES because they realized they were doing good with the combat and made a mode entirely about the combat. 

So how’s the Remake? I like it, I think its pretty cool.

I guess. 

Its kind of nostalgic to play, much like the Ganados, I too understand what it’s like to get kicked in the face by a cop. If I were stupid I would say “Its how I remember RE4 looking.” but that’s really dumb because I replayed RE4 in 2018 and before that in 2015 and before that in 2013 and before that in 2010. I remember what RE4 looks like. 

For some reason, the nice shiny graphics remind me of another game called Haunting Ground that came out roughly the same time as RE4 classic, I don’t know why. It does a good job with fog and other effects, giving the forgotten Spanish countryside this really shitty and dingy feeling, but in a good way. All of the buildings look like they’re barely being held together, and everyone that isn’t a regular human looks REALLY gross, which is also a good thing.

This time around, Leon is a lot more mobile, capable of moving while aiming, which is REVOLUTIONARY and I won’t let you tell me otherwise. Not only that, but Leon can also parry melee attacks and a bunch of ranged attacks as well. Its fun to just go “Nope” when one of the suckers gets too close and then kick him in the face anyway.

Also, you kick a lot of people in the face in this game. 

I like the new Leon. He’s still that funny action hero type, but now you get to see a lot more of that RPD rookie in him. He’s more assuring and empathetic to Ashley and other characters, but he’ll still drop a sick one liner after a boss fight.
Its the perfect combo. 

It knows what it is now, doesn’t try to hide anything you know is coming. The Plaga makes itself known from enemy one, a cutscene that was once an easter egg is now just part of the main story. Instead, it hits you with new stuff, like an open-area boat section for some reason and new twists and turns to keep you guessing. 

And if you really need to know and somehow don’t know yet. Don’t worry.
Huey is okay. 

Its not a 1:1 remake, which is nice, it hits you with new stuff, enemies behave differently, you find certain weapons at different points, some characters have bigger roles than they had before. So what IS wrong with it? 

Well, Ada sounds like she wants to see my manager. I get that hiring practices have changed for voice acting because pulling the ladder up behind you is RIFE in industries like this. But you don’t actually have to hire the first lady to apply for the job, you can still have standards. 
And sometimes I felt like the game dragged on a little longer than the classic version, some scenes feel needlessly longer and events can go on and on. 

Also, there’s $201 of DLC. Most of it is just cosmetics and cheat-code DLCs for if you’re stinky and suck at the game. But Separate Ways, which came with the PS2 version of the original and then every version of that onward, is DLC for the Remake, which feels like a cop out. 
Assignment: ADA is also nowhere to be found, and there’s probably other modes that I just can’t remember that are missing. Maybe, I dunno. 

U-3 is also just missing, I’m not going to explain what that is in case you, somehow, haven’t played RE4, but I liked that fight, I thought it was fun. Quick time events are also gone, outside of some context gameplay parts, if you cared about those then I guess that’s a problem.

Ballistics are also gone. Unacceptable.

Outside of that, I think its a good way to experience Resident Evil 4. I would still recommend playing the original as well, either before or after the Remake, just so you can get a feeling of how much has changed. 

Game looks good, combat is fun, guns feel good to use, you have a parry now, not much to actually hate. There are probably better reviewers out there that can go into details of why this game is actually doo doo paper, but 99% of the games I review are positive on my curator.

I try not to buy bad games, is the thing.

Resident Evil 4: Remake: Not called RE4 Remake but just Resident Evil 4 now, gets 8 Ashley’s screaming out of 10. 

The very first version of Resident Evil 4 became the first Devil May Cry game.

Resident Evil 4 Remake is everything a modernized classic should be. From the moment you step into the eerie village to the heart-pounding castle sequences, every moment is cinematic perfection. The controls are smooth, the combat is tight, and the visuals are jaw-dropping—Leon’s journey has never looked this good.

I’ve just completed the main story with Leon, and wow… it’s a thrill ride from start to finish. Each encounter keeps you on your toes, puzzles feel satisfying, and the tension never lets up. Now I’m diving into Ada’s separate mission, and I can already tell the experience will be just as gripping, offering a fresh perspective on the story we all know and love.

Verdict

Resident Evil 4 Remake is a flawless reimagining of a legendary game. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer, it delivers perfect pacing, intense combat, and cinematic horror.

This one wildly exceeds expectations. I jumped on the Resident Evil bandwagon with RE5, and have always been more into the action portion of the saga. Even though, RE4 became my favorite for the balance it managed to achieve because ""spookyness"" and ""action"".

The remake sublimate the formula. It fixes lots and lots of issues the original had (weird pacing, weird architecture, questionable plot points, insufferable NPCs...) while modernizing the graphics and the control (You can shoot AND move now. And you aim and reload like John Wick !) to make a remake that's really better than the original and well worth your money. 

Hell, they even remade the Separate Ways DLC and fleshed it out completely when it left a very bad taste when I played it in the original !

So, yeah. I recommend Resident Evil 4 Remake. I even found myself booting it up for fun just because I love the gameplay, and I generally don't boot up games I finished because of my back log !

Also, it may say I played it on Steam Deck. I did actually play it on a computer running Bazzite with an OLED/HDR enabled monitor. It was one of the few game I felt the investment was worth it.",True,0,3338

Is what I would say to capcom even after I got the remake at 50% off because this remake is lacking and boring in the story and action and camp department. Apparently, this remake is trying to take the plot so seriously, that it lost the unbeatable charm of the original resident evil 4. I noticed that they don’t do jokes and that the characters aren’t having fun [u] (I mean it is a life-threatening situation but come on, its Leon Kennedy, the superhero of the resident evil franchise aside from Chris the boulder-puncher) [/u]   I noticed that they were taking this remake to be more of a horror thriller when they got chased by the Big cheese and then the bridge exploded, u know, the cutscene before the Big cheese boss fight. The original was more of an action comedy and I really missed that but don’t get me wrong, I will still keep playing this until I finished it for the nth time because of the level design and the overall gameplay and gunplay but I do wish it stuck more to the spirit of the original

[b] PROS: [/b]

[list] 
[*]  Ashley – jesus Christ shes immaculate here, almost rivals the beauty of Lara Croft from the survivor trilogy
[*] Improved level designs – the starting areas in the levels were improved, the area after the lake bossfight also seemed to be an open world of sorts
[*] Opening village fight – the opening scene where the Ganados burn the Spanish policeman and the ensuing fight was still exhilarating like the original
[*] Good graphics on a 4 gb vram laptop
[*] Parry system – the added parry mechanic made the game faster and is probably best played on harder difficulties [u] (I played on hardcore for my first run) [/u]
[*] Gunplay – much more smooth and fluid than the original (you can also move while aiming! [u] (The original makes u stand still whenever you aim and is really really clunky by today’s standards) [/u]
[*] Overall character models – ada, leon, Ashley, luis, the main bosses all looked really cool
[*] Side missions – made the game longer and that’s ok because its fun
[/list]

[b] CONS:  [/b]
[list]
[*] Voice-acting: they do a really good job in the acting but it seems that, since the plot is more serious now, they seem muted or dead or lacks charisma and doesn’t really seem alive 
[*] Mood - It’s a bit more scary but the original had that campyness to it, like the evil dead film series so I kinda missed that
[*] No door physics – in the original, you can shoot holes on doors, and with those holes, you can also shoot the ganados
[*] Miscellaneous cut content –  wheres the giant Ramon mech scene? wheres the popstar Ashley costume? wheres the P.R.L 412? wheres the ada's assignment mini game?
[*] the ada dlc shouldve been free since it only takes 5 hrs to finish
[*] Resources – why add this? We do not need this but I guess it does leave the player so many choices on what ammo or grenades to craft

This game doesn't lecture to you about pronouns and pride flags.  It doesn't censor characters appearances, it doesn't try to uplift minorities.  It just focuses solely on gameplay, good story, escapism, fantasy. I love that. 

It does use the word gender instead of sex when explaining luis.  It saids Gender:  Male  instead of Sex:  Male thats about the only negative but can be fix with mods.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,203025092,"The Resident Evil 4 Remake has caused a lot of love and hate amongst fans of the original RE4. However, one significant improvement is noticeable in the writing. As entertaining as the original was in action-movie-style environments, the writing always left much to be desired as the storyline did drag on. The Remake turns it to eleven by creating a coherent narrative and dividing parts into more streamlined chapters. (With some much-needed cut moments, although there are a few which are missed.)

In this way, players are encouraged not just to run from one part to the next but to take the time to explore the area, find notes and files, and learn more about the environment they are exploring. It also improves the character development for Leon, Luis, and Ashley (and even unlikely antagonists such as Mendez, Ramon, and Krauser) in a way which fits the slightly rewritten events.

The game's tone is noticeably a lot darker than the original. Even as someone who played the remake before the original, I have to say this doesn't inherently make the game ""better"" or ""worse."" The remake’s decision to use its models and environments through the RE Engine is primarily stunning. (Ashley, Luis, and Ada are the most noticeable to receive makeovers, while even Dr. Salvador and the Chainsaw Sisters remain much more frightening renditions of their appearances). The environments feel stunningly out of a dark fantasy novel and fit the moodier tone of the writing. Additionally, the audio remains crisp much like the original for its time, from the ganados' Spanish dialogue to the eerie ambience of background music.

The addition of stealth, crouching, and, of course, parrying makes combat much more entertaining and, in a surprisingly fun way, personal, as the player can decide how they want to approach chapters or entire boss fights. Enemy types’ AI works more “smartly” in the remake when attempting to dodge or evade your attacks. The additional abilities to now craft items, store them in an inventory, and, of course, not have to endure as many QTEs make the game sleeker in its combat mechanics. The game also returns to Resident Evil's core by enhancing puzzles to make them slightly more challenging and tense. For example, Ashley’s section is given an improved makeover, proving that there are moments when the game goes above and beyond to deliver an entertaining final product.

The 2023 version has additional options from challenges to complete, requests from the Merchant (who still serves as a likely fan favourite), unique weapons or extras to buy from points collected, and, of course, charms from the shooting gallery. Like the original, the game gives you the option of additional difficulty levels and new game plus.

However, the remake also has a few flaws. One of the weirdest for a 2023 game has to be the odd glitching effect when enemies behind doors or walls begin phasing through with their weapons. Additionally, items can remain hanging in the air for several seconds before the animation kicks in, and of course, the grainy effect over some models’ facial expressions (without enhancement mods). The cutscenes are remarkable with animation, but they sometimes create an uncanny impact when panning over faces in gameplay.

One major issue I did have with gameplay was Ashley's AI in the remake. While, as a character in the original, Ashley could be a little grating, her AI mechanics were pretty straightforward: she would get behind you in combat or listen to commands to ""stay"" or ""follow,"" making engaging in battle much easier. In the remake, Ashley suffers from the opposite fate: better writing but arguably more annoying AI. Don't get me wrong—Ashley’s AI is much more advanced and an improvement in certain areas (including climbing ladders, locking doors, and even helping Leon), but in close combat, her AI is sometimes akin to a weighed-down anchor.

Of course, the game wants to keep you challenged and multitask, but there's a fine line between strategy and a pure test of sanity when Ashley dive bombs out of a locker in front of a brutal enemy (especially on harder difficulties). As much as I love the improved writing of the game, Ashley's AI wasn't it.

One thing I did notice (much like the original) is that Resident Evil's writing struggles in its final chapters, specifically around the Island. The lack of narrative buildup in favour of big-budget cutscenes and enemies makes going around sections a little tiresome.

Overall Thoughts: Resident Evil 4 (2023) is a remake with a lot of time and effort put into it, as well as a good action game in its own right. It attempts to streamline the original's over-the-top events while still maintaining an element of freshness. Although the game does sometimes suffer a bit with its tonal shift, there are significant improvements in writing, graphics, and mechanics. Resident Evil 4 (2023) is a brilliant game worth replaying.",True,16,3724

Cuz she's fking idiot 
Or she get kidnapped without I noticing her!!!

RE5 always gets crapped on for turning the series into an action shooter. Well, RE4 kinda did it first. At least RE5 had some kind of connection to Umbrella and Wesker. TLDR: No RE4=No RE6. You feel me? So with that said, I love the remake. It actually feels scary. Yes, it keeps the action from RE4 OG but the tension is so much higher in this remake. And they flesh out the story more so that it connects more with the original games. REZero, RE, RE2, RE3, RE Code Veronica... all of those games feel more like prequels to this remake than Shinji Mikami's original RE4 2005. So, if you are new to the series and can't decide if you want to get the 2005 version or the remake, I'm going to have to recommend the remake.

Resident Evil 4 Remake is a thrilling reimagining of the 2005 classic, following Leon S. Kennedy on a high-stakes mission to rescue Ashley Graham, the U.S. President's daughter, from a sinister cult in a remote European village. I started this game back in late 2023, played through chapters 1 to 9, but life got in the way, and I didn't pick it up again until 2025 to finish chapters 9 to 16. Honestly, I'm a different person now compared to when I started, which makes reviewing this game a bit tricky, but let's dive in.

The story is pretty good, delivering a gripping narrative that follows Leon's journey to save Ashley from a creepy cult. Ashley herself is surprisingly likable, not just a damsel in distress, which adds depth to the plot. The pacing keeps you hooked, and the cult's eerie vibe sets a great tone, even if the game leans more action-packed than terrifying. It's a solid, engaging story that carries the game well.

Gameplay is where it truly shines, it's the meat of the experience. The action is polished and fun, with a great balance of challenge on standard difficulty. It's not particularly scary, probably the least frightening of the recent Resident Evil releases, but that doesn't detract from the enjoyment. The weapon variety is impressive, giving you plenty of ways to tackle enemies, and the enemy diversity keeps encounters fresh. Puzzles are straightforward, avoiding frustration, and the game's length feels just right, not too short, not dragged out.

Visually, the game is stunning. The environments are richly detailed, and the character models are incredibly well-crafted, bringing Leon, Ashley, and the creepy cultists to life. Performance-wise, it runs smoothly even on my older laptop, which was a pleasant surprise. No hiccups or lag, just a seamless experience that lets you focus on the action.

I still have to play the DLC and finish the 100%. I guess that's not happening till 2027 :p 

[b]TL;DR: All in all, Resident Evil 4 Remake is an absolute gem. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the series, this remake is a must-play ![/b]",True,1,2765

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202849780,"Resident Evil 4 Remake is an incredibly enjoyable title that modifies and expands upon more from what the timeless classic - Resident Evil 4 (2005) - had to offer; this makes it a really worthy successor to the original. 

The combat is definitely the highlight of the game with crazy addicting roundhouse kicks from Leon and insane grapple takedowns from Ada will leave you feeling like the most badass person alive. It would not be Resident Evil though if it was not survival horror based; you can feel the game limiting your drops of ammo and throwables, especially on professional difficulty. If Resident Evil 2 focused on absolute nightmares in the dark and dilapidated cramped hallways of the Raccoon Police Department leaving you absolutely frightened to even open the next room while having next to no ammo, Resident Evil 4 throws you in a freaking rural Spanish home in a storm with a horde of crazed Spaniards with pitchforks and torches absolutely hatcheting their way into your safe space until you find a way out. Professional difficulty really brings out the horror of how well can you keep your nerves and rise above the situation with limited resources. See an oil lantern above the entryway? Shoot it down to deny them from encroaching on your space. See a shelf next to a window? better move it to buy you some time. See ladders being placed? Kick it down to prevent yourself from getting overwhelmed. Its nerve wracking and intense, as the game tests how you can make the most of the situation.

Having played both the original and the remake, I can definitely tell that Resident Evil 2 Remake laid the groundwork for Leon S. Kennedy's character progression. From a really naive and highly impressionable rookie cop to a certified BADASS of a special agent. His cheesy one liners from the original that made him so lovable for fans to this day is still alive in the remake! However, on a serious note, he does drop some powerful liners too. The line that really made an impact for me was: ""this time, it has to be different."" as he tries to save this innocent girl from the cult. I could immediately tell this was not the same Leon that Ada Wong played like a fiddle.

Ada's campaign was really cool too. The game shows how much of an ultra confident and outstanding spy she actually is. At the end of Resident Evil 2 do we only get a reveal that she is actually an undercover mercenary and it is such a delight to see how she works. She still keeps her theme of dress to impress persona in such stressful scenarios, which i personally found comical. Its kinda crazy too how so much of the events that Leon handles in the main story is actually a result of something she throws his way or personally decides to intervene in. Its pretty obvious she cares for Leon even if she manipulates him in this installment, just like in Resident Evil 2.

Luis Serra Navarro is DEFINITELY the character that has received the most expansion compared to the original. In this one, he has a more fleshed out backstory that most players might have missed. He used to live in the game's village with his grandfather who is the town's hunter. His grandfather and the chief took note of his outstanding curiosity and noted he might have become a great scholar if he was not stuck in the village, which is exactly what he ended up doing. Coming back to the village to see the chief and so many people from the village he used to know become crazed fanatics must have been so heartbreaking to him. Its so saddening from the village chief's notes of how he loved the village. He loved taking photographs of the village and was proud of it. It was so wholesome how the villagers were already happy seeing their tools sharp and clean, how delighted they were that their new diesel powered engine for their fishing boats would help them catch fish better and would race them across the lake for sport, as children lay around in a circle to listen to the guitar player like music is exotic in this part of the world. It makes their inevitable invasion by Osmund Saddler all the more bittersweet.

I'm a die hard Resident Evil fan. Played most of the games, watched most of the movies, read most of the lore. RE4 2005 was and is still one of my all time favorites. The quirkiness, the difficult battles, the fact the stakes were high but the game didn't take itself too seriously. 

Re4 2005 was and is a love letter to the good old 80's-90's action cheesie action hero genre. Leon saying ""Where's everyone going? Bingo?"" or ""No thanks.. Bro"" reminded me of Arnold schwarzenegger in True lies saying ""You're fired"" before launching the BBG at a building while attached to a fighter jet's missile. 

Leon has the personality of a wet slice of bread now. Ashely is now a generic millenial (like me, boohoo), Ada Wong is a manipulative unlikeable btch... The only character who got an improvement was Luis, but only cuz he has more impact in this game and they KEPT his quirky ""good for nothing guy who happens to be quite the ladies man"" attitude. 

The combat feels weak. The guns shoot like shit. We don't even get enough bullets to justify a bullet spread like counter strike or any reticle oriented game. 

I tried to like this game due to my love for the franchise. But I won't be finishing it. It is just too boring.

Resident Evil 4 Remake is a greate remake of a legendary game.
It modernizes everything — from combat and visuals to character depth — while staying faithful to the tone, pacing, and absurd charm of the original. Whether you're a veteran or newcomer, this is essential survival horror.

Pros:

Incredible third-person combat with smooth gunplay and satisfying feedback

Gorgeous visuals, atmospheric lighting, and improved level design

Expanded story and character moments, especially for Ashley and Luis

Smart reworks to puzzles, boss fights, and pacing

New parry and stealth mechanics add variety

High replay value with New Game+, Challenges, and Mercenaries Mode

Cons:

Some iconic lines and campy moments were toned down or changed

Knife durability might annoy players early on

A few boss encounters are less memorable than the original

harder than it needs to be as some area have hordes of ennemies with little to any Ammo

Paid ""P2W"" DLC in a solo game

Final Thoughts:
This isn’t just a remake — it’s a redefining of what a remake should be. Capcom nailed it. RE4 Remake respects its legacy while boldly pushing the franchise forward. Action, horror, and cheese — perfectly blended.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202789181,"a worse version of a classic:

gameplay: while playing a lot smoother with it no longer having tank controls its a lot less engaging.
-you can now parry with you knife, making everything a bloody quick time event untill it breaks/
-guns now dont handle as well, lower accuracy and less impactfull feeling
-it took a lot of things from re2 like the map that just tells you if you missed something

music: white noise

story: a b-movie rewritten by boring nerds, the og game had quit a bit of humour which has been minimized in this remake that tries to walk the impossible line between the originals b-movie comedy and the horror that we saw in re7 and it fails, its now neither. the general series of events is the same but just worse.

performance: dogshit, if it got any worse we would get negative framerate. i can run it but anyone using graphics cards before the 40 series should just not even try or get some mod that improves it.

graphics: meh, it tries to go for hyperrealism (really fucking dumb for what used to be a b-movie game) but its undercut by the lack of design chops, making everything important slathered in yellow paint.

tldr:
a unremarkable downgrade of a classic, passes the time but doesnt do anything better that other games or even the original do. if you want a better horror game play resident evil 7. You want a better third person game like that? play re2. if you want the re4 story but better? play the original from fucking 2005 that is somehow better. at least this one is modable so we can tweak it back a bit to how it used to be.

Ashley appeared to be a very nice young lady who reminds me of Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite. I can’t blame her for wanting Leon to be permanently assigned to her case.

Leon himself feels different from the original, and I think that’s for the better. He had great punchlines in the original but that made him similar to Dante from Devil May Cry. Leon has pretty arms, but be careful: staring at them for too long can make you pregnant >:D

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202711200,"Few games manage to take a legendary classic, elevate it in every possible way, and still preserve the original magic. Capcom has done exactly that. Resident Evil 4 Remake isn’t just a remake – it’s a redefinition of what a remake should be.

The visuals are absolutely stunning, breathing new life into the eerie villages, the gothic castle, and the sinister laboratory with cinematic realism. Lighting, atmosphere, and environmental detail all combine to create a chilling and unforgettable world.

Combat has been reimagined with smart refinements: shooting feels weighty and precise, parries with the knife add layers of strategy, and every encounter feels intense, unpredictable, and deeply satisfying.

The story remains faithful to the original but benefits from stronger writing, improved pacing, and deeper character portrayals – with Ashley in particular receiving a more respectful and well-rounded treatment. The balance of horror, tension, and high-octane action keeps you hooked from beginning to end.

Sound design is top-notch, with an atmospheric score and terrifying audio cues that keep you on edge throughout.

Capcom has set a new gold standard for remakes. Whether you’re a longtime fan or experiencing Leon’s journey for the first time, Resident Evil 4 Remake is an essential experience – intense, polished, and unforgettable.

On the other hand, there are some design choices that somewhat spoil the experience. The garish yellow markings on the crates give the impression that the developers are treating players like idiots, as if we're incapable of exploring on our own. It's a real drag on immersion. Another unfortunate point: the corpses disappear far too quickly. In Resident Evil 2 Remake, the fact that they remain reinforced the heavy atmosphere and the feeling of constant danger. Here, it breaks the tension a bit.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202640606,"I will preface this by saying that original RE4 is one of my favorite games and the only RE game in my experience. I played it in my childhood (I think it was a crappy port with keyboard controls) and I got all achievements in Steam version. I had high hopes for the remake and it did not disappoint.

My first playthrough was on Hardcore without guides, which was pretty difficult. I noticed that combat is generally different from other third person shooters like Max Payne. Since there are very little hitscanners, I’m free to run around enemies. Even though Leon can now move while aiming, the slow speed reminded me a little bit of original tank controls. Guns feel powerful, and shooting them is great. Speaking of shooting, the shooting range is a mixed bag. Challenges themselves are good but randomized and repeating rewards discouraged me from doing it in consecutive playthroughs. This took 15 hours in game and 26 hours in real life.

I rarely replay games, even more so when it comes to multiple playthroughs, but something about this game really made me want to replay it. I think it’s a combination of relatively short length, abundance of shortcuts and skippable cut scenes. I was surprised end credits were skippable too, because a lot of Japanese games don’t let you skip them (Metal Gear Rising, Dark Souls, Yakuza). Anyway, my second playthrough revolved around collectibles and miscellaneous trophies. It took 7.2 hours in game and 13 IRL because I forgot some treasures and had to load back. Some of the points of no return make no sense here.

My third playthrough combined minimalist and silent stranger. Blacktail, Red 9 and Primal Knife were my best friends. This was the only time I didn’t cheese Saddler with Rocket Launcher and one of two times I didn’t egg Salazar. 4.5 hours for this run.

Since wanted to optimize things a bit, I combined Professional A rank and Frugalist in one run. I thought infinite RL would make this super easy, and for the most part it did. I only took long term damage against Krauser knife duel and his final form, although I did load saves many times when being hit outside of bosses. 4.5 hours in game, 8 hours IRL.

Ok, whose idea was it made Hardcore S+ and Standard S+ achievements not stack? I chose to bite the bullet and beat Professional S+. I took as many shortcuts as possible (Ashley armor, sunglasses, Chicago sweeper), but it was still tough, especially in Village section. I can’t understand how people manage do this stuff without these legal cheats. 5 hours in game, 10 hours IRL.

Overall, this was my best gaming experience so far this year. My only pet peeves are that pressing “Continue” after death doesn’t reset timer and the aforementioned lack of S+ achievement stacking.",True,0,389

Revisiting Resident Evil 4 once again kinda felt surreal. I wasn't really sure what to expect going into it. I knew that the game was faithful to the original game but also changed and updated the game in some significant ways too. So after spending just shy of 20 hours on my play through is this more remake or remaster? Honestly I feel like its a bit of both.

The first time I ever played Resident Evil 4 was the HD version on the Xbox 360. I had actually played Resident Evil 5 before I got a chance to play 4, beat that game on every difficulty and unlocked everything you could possibly get. And after all that I still sunk another 100 hours into the Mercenaries mode, so needless to say I was very excited when Resident Evil 4 HD got announced. Much like RE5 I would end up playing this game front to back, unlocking everything I possibly could, going for the fastest complete times I could get.

Starting RE4 Remake feels... comfortable, like I'm slipping into a familiar pair of shoes again. The shooting and controls that RE4 became legendary for have been updated and modernized for a whole new generation. I don't want to come off hyperbolic when I say this but there's really no dancing around it: this might be the best playing third person shooter I've ever played. I felt that way back in 2011 and now I find myself feeling that exact way again. Having played RE2 Remake I knew they were likely going to add moving while shooting to RE4 but I did not anticipate the impact that would have.

Leon controls so much more fluid now, easily bobbing and weaving out of the way of enemies and effortlessly popping headshots off on zombies foolish enough to charge you. You definitely do NOT need to fear enemies in this game like you did RE2 Remake. You would think that giving the player that kind of power would impact its ability to scare you but I'm happy to see that isn't the case. RE4 was never really a ""scary"" game so much as it was an intense one. Each scenario is like a little combat puzzle where the game turns up the heat with more enemies and more enemy types to try and catch you off guard.

I'll tell you right now though despite having so much more control over Leon and often times feeling like an unstoppable killing machine there was one area in the game, or rather one enemy type, that ALWAYS made my skin crawl. No, not the Regenerador, and no not the Verdugo either. Though I will give credit where it's do when the Verdugo first appears he absolutely scared the hell outta me. It was: the Novistadors. Yeah those giant camouflaged flying bugs. The sound they made, the ambient music that would kick in, the fact that they were just EVERYWHERE and very often blending into the environment. I felt like I had to take a shower after encountering these things every single time.

Presentation wise this game is a top tier offering on just about every level. There are very few games out there today that not only look as good as RE4 Remake does but also run as good as it does too. Across my nearly 20 hour long play through my game was running maxed out in 4k and I stayed at a rock solid 120 FPS for most of it. There were definitely some sections towards the end that got a little intense but nothing game breaking or egregious in any way. It's incredible to me that Capcom has been able to craft an engine like this that is so strikingly beautiful and performant off the heels of their last big engine success: MT Framework.

It's been a long time since a game had me up until 6am because I couldn't put it down, but that is exactly what happened to me multiple times with RE4 Remake. Resident Evil 4 was the greatest third person shooter ever made... until Capcom decided to reinvent the wheel.

Resident Evil 4 Remake is once again at the top of the mountain and I'm not sure anyone can knock it down again outside of Capcom themselves.

The game is fantastic. Another example of how well made some of these new Resident Evil games have been. The story, graphics and gameplay are all top tier.

This one has a bit more of an RPG feel to it than the previous games, which I like. You can see a lot of Resident Evil Village in this game, which I really enjoy. I hope Capcom do more of this in the future as it adds a strategic element to the game with building your loadout and choosing which upgrades to purchase etc. It means you can take on each chapter in a variety of different ways to suit your preferences (and also ammo availability, although on normal difficulty you don't tend to run out).

Some RE purists may not enjoy this as much as RE:2 but that really comes down to personal taste - the enemies are less zombie like and the level design is generally more open than Raccoon City PD etc. but there are moments where you will get closed in.

The game is and I think always will be and absolute masterpiece.

As for Separate Ways, it is also very good, a bit of a filler but enough ingenuity that keeps you hooked, you are not playing as Leon but Ada Wong, and that means it takes a turn towards the spy thriller genre, a bit like the Ada chapter from RE2 but very good nevertheless.

I was surprised to find its barely a horror game (a good thing for me), its more of an action game with horror themes. The gunplay is very good, especially on a mouse and keyboard, and the resource economy is tight but fair. I very rarely found myself completely starved for ammo/health items, but regularly found myself coming down to my last few bullets. This kept things tense enough to be interesting, but not so scarce that I was stressed while playing. 

The game is beautiful, with loads of graphics options to tweak (though no DLSS which was disappointing and bizarre in 2025). And whats better, it played at 70-100 FPS the whole time on my 3080/R7. They even fixed the HDR issues that plague all Capcom games, meaning I didnt have to use AutoHDR, SpecialK or Nvidia HDR. No crashes, no game-breaking bugs, and no necessary mods to fix basic stuff (except again, should have DLSS).

The story is fine, but god-damn do I love Leon. He's a bad-ass quip machine, and everything that came out of his mouth had me smirking. Ashley is a good character, but her damsel-in-distress gameplay segments SUCK, and are the one thing holding this game back from perfection. I died maybe once before meeting her, and I immediately failed/died 15 times over in the first gameplay with her.

1) RE2make
2) RE 7
3) RE4make
4) R3make
5) RE Village

[h2]Good[/h2]
- Good length as far as modern games go that aren't endless online games (~25 hours for my non-rushed playthrough)
- Gunplay is all fine and well
- Graphics all good
- While there are no side games that I could see like in previous entries, the shooting range serves as a minigame and I found it far more fun than the bonus game modes in the other REs. Not just kinda fun, but also unlocks rewards for your playthrough and you don't have to quit story mode to play it. I did have to watch walkthroughs for a couple though.
- Decent variety of locations
- While it wasn't addicting/bingeworthy, I found it fun enough to keep chipping away at over a period of months
- The damsel in distress was surprisingly not annoying

- Addition of stealth knife kills is appreciated, but stealth as a whole is untenable in this game; crouch system isn't really meant for hiding just going under obstacles, so you crouch behind a small wall and it doesn't matter, some villager on a roof spots you and yells and the whole area comes at you, and they spot you from pretty far away
- Usually in these games if you haven't done something the first time you've gone to an area you come back to it later in the game to finish, so there were sidequests I didn't do straight away. As it turned out most of them you do have to do straight away because you actually don't come back to these areas in later chapters. Occasionally the trader will comment ""Make sure you finish all jobs before you leave"" but often by that point it's too late because a scripted event where something collapses and blocks an entrance has occurred and you can't go back to do it. Even after I got used to that happening and vowed to do all jobs as I came across them, it didn't work; there was one late game job where you had to destroy all the medallions, but I simply couldn't see two of them from any of the positions I could take in the area, so I figured ""Okay I must get a better vantage point to see and shoot them later in the chapter""... nope!
- I know you don't want every game to be the same but this one does not have a spooki sequence where you have to avoid a scary mfer slowly coming for you like RE2, RE7 or even RE8. Lame guy chasing you out in the open while villagers shoot arrows at you doesn't count, doesn't make you shit your pants.
- This game allows you to use a sniper rifle, which is nice since so much of the game is outdoors and enemies can be spotted a while away; however this is hindered by the amount of invisible walls blocking bullets. An example is like a balcony wall with lots of big gaps in it, try to shoot someone through those gaps and nope... the gaps have an invisible bullet stopping wall in them. You try a slightly different angle just to be safe and nope... now you've just wasted 2-3 rifle bullets which are quite precious in this game, so much so that I often had to reload autosave. Another one is the binocular points in the game, sometimes you look through the binoculars and Leon goes ""Look at all those bad guys"", I then put down the binoculars and aim with my sniper but what's this? There's now a giant fucking wall in the way and I can't see anyone. As it turns out a lot of the binocular spots are faked, and when you enter them you actually get teleported into the air so you can actually see everything... really clumsy design in a game where you give players a sniper rifle.

[h2]Summary[/h2]
A game that probably won't have you hooked or addicted, with a bit more action than horror overall, but is good enough to play to the finish, and you definitely won't regret if you buy [b]on a discount[/b].

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202337739,"I am currently playing Resident Evil 4 Remake after finishing RE2 and RE3, continuing the series. The graphics are a clear step up, and exploration is interesting since the map doesn’t show if you’re leaving items behind, so you really have to check every corner. Exploration 10/10!

Unfortunately, that’s where my enjoyment ends. The game has introduced a merchant in the middle of a zombie-infested world, turning what should be a tense survival horror game into an arcade-like experience. Buying guns, ammo, and items in the middle of nowhere literally destroys any sense of survival. The zombies feel more like “semi-zombies”; they can use weapons and are far too easy to kill. There’s a simple tactic: shoot the head and kick them, rinse and repeat. It’s not challenging, and it doesn’t feel like classic Resident Evil anymore.

My only positives so far are the graphics and the exploration mechanic, but the core gameplay and atmosphere have been ruined by the arcade-style design. If you love survival horror, I cannot recommend this game. It’s a joke compared to the tension and challenge of the previous RE games.

If this is the direction they’re taking with the game, I hope they eventually make a proper open-world RPG where you can interact with survivors who trade and sell items (similar to Fallout 4 or other open-world survival games). Just imagine how popular it would be an open-world with Resident Evil. However, as it stands, I don’t enjoy this new trading mechanic; it feels childish and completely breaks immersion.",False,5,1606

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202330563,"A pretty good remake of a game that probably didn't need the remake treatment. Combat feels good, dismemberment and gore is fun and satisfying (albeit toned down somewhat from RE2 remake) and the performances of the characters are good. I know the actor who played Ada got a lot of flak but I like her performance here - detached and cool works for Ada - though I do think she could have benefited from better direction. The merchant is a little too chatty for my tastes. 

 The one thing that is  a step down is the mercenaries mode. It's fine but not including Waterworld from 4 is a misstep. It also seems a lot less chaotic than something like 5's no mercy mode and enemy counts are much reduced.  The character loadouts also seem very limiting especially considering the variety you get in RE5. Graphically it is impressive and well optimized like all RE engine games at this point. 

Capcom if you are listening please don't remake 5 - it is fine as it is. If you want to touch 6 - then by all means but 5 is fine just the way it is.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202303006,"A solid remake. Be warned however. Much of this games design is two steps forward and one step back in a lot of areas. Many deviations from the original game have made the game play worse and less user friendly. Ashley has been genuinely made worse in every way end of discussion. You can no longer decide where to position her. She will actively work against the effort of the player in virtually every instance by intentionally running into crowds of enemies and in my case actually camp the doors that they use to take her through and end your run attempt many times. This ""design choice"" almost turned this into a not recommended  review its so bad. The shooting is fun but RNG based in terms of accuracy and damage. Accuracy due to cross hair bloom and damage because of crit chances. Don't even get me started on the abysmal shooting range situation because of it. The game introduces a parrying knife mechanic that is only useful against single enemies because all a group needs to do and will do is offset their attacks to punish the window where the player is locked in the parry animation. The positives are that this obviously looks amazing down to every last inch you can see and sounds incredible as well.

The gameplay, the story, the graphics, the horror, everything is perfect. The game has no bugs, and I didn't notice any flaws at all. This game is perfect, in every way.

It takes one of the most influential games of all time and enhances every aspect: the story is richer, the characters feel more human, the environments are more immersive, and the gameplay has been refined to perfection.

The atmosphere is darker and more intense, the pacing is spot-on, and every encounter feels even more dynamic thanks to smarter enemy AI and expanded mechanics. The combat is fluid and satisfying, with just the right balance between survival horror tension and action-packed firefights.

It is easily one of the best remakes ever created, rivaled only by Resident Evil 2 Remake in terms of quality and respect for the source material. Capcom has proven once again that they understand exactly how to bring a classic into the modern era without compromise.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202086485,"Resident Evil 4 (2005) is a game I like a lot. It's got a lot of fun aspects to it, so much so that I bought it on Xbox 360, Switch, and finally on PC to play on my Steam Deck. I have to have beaten it at least 4-5 times on Standard difficulty, and I regularly replay it. I actually first played it in roughly 2016, so it wasn't a strictly nostalgia thing as to why I love it so much.

I write that preface to say that I [b]absolutely[/b] HATE this Remake, only two hours in. I'll break it out into my personal, somewhat subjective Pros and Cons list,

Pros
1. Absolutely gorgeous - the game is graphically tremendous, looking visually fantastic. This is the way that I imagine most people remember Resident Evil 4 who played it when it first came out in 2005, and it really sticks the landing in that respect.
2. Level Design Changes - the levels have changed dramatically, so much so that it's difficult to compare it to RE4 when evaluating it. The entire game is different. If you played the original and want a twist on the original, there's a reason to play it there. 
3. Leon controls better - 2005 utilizes tank controls. This mean Leon controls independent of the camera and Leon IS the camera. It's difficult to explain, but this game is fluid whereas 2005 is rigid.

Now onto the long list of cons...
1. Reload animations - Worse. Far worse. The default handgun in the original game had a snappy, quick reload. In this game, Leon reloads... Then puts the gun to the side for a second, preventing him from quickly firing off more bullets. 2005's reloads had a small amount of lag time for Leon to bring it back up, but here it feels so weird, out of place, and much longer. They're also not cool anymore, and instead are ""realistic"" as opposed to being Leon loading two shells to load 6, or just shoving an entire clip of rounds into the Rifle in the original.
2. Weapon balance - In the original game, the Shotgun establishes itself early on as the ""Get Away From Me"" stick. Enemy in your face? Shotgun it. Chainsaw Guy getting in your face? Shotgun him, knock him back a few feet. The Shotgun here feels so... Whimpy. No longer does Chainsaw Guy get knocked back 6-12 feet from a blast. Enemies don't get knocked around by it. The Pistol itself also feels like it has dramatically less impact on shots. Enemies in the original game couldn't take much before they recoiled in pain, whereas here it feels inconsistent and difficult to line-up shots to do enough to get a melee strike in.
3. Knife Counters - I. Hate. Knife. Counters. I hate them a lot. The Knife in this game is a limited use counter object, whereas in 2005, it was only really used as your (free) melee attack. This limited use knife can be repaired, but it costs LIMITED currency to do so. Don't get grabbed? See point 2, enemies just shrug off attacks and power through anyway. In the original game, you have the ability to quickly mash/twist your joystick to get the enemy off without suffering much (if any) damage whereas here you HAVE to use the limited durability knife to save yourself. I want to use as few resources as possible in my Survival Horror, but you're forcing me into using this thing for a lot of ""things,"" and I don't like it. At least make it free but do dramatically less damage or something.
4. Crafting - RE4 did have some very light crafting elements. Here, your inventory is filled up with garbage resources to combine and I don't like it, I'd rather just have the ammo than two-slot big part bags or one-slot big gunpowder. It feels like it's here because RE8 had it, not because it should be here.
5. Voice Acting - Leon's original voice actor ate up his scenes. He really sold himself as this confident, in control and cool action hero (which was intentional) whereas this Leon is just... Tired. And I get it, Capcom has been making the Remakes substantially more serious, but it's less fun as a result. Leon doesn't sound cool, he sounds bored. 
6. Leon's Quips - After killing enemies, Leon will sometimes shout a quip like ""Another one down"" or ""How many more are there?"" It's lame. Leon's quips in the original game were only for cutscenes, their brevity and one-time use ensured they were memorable. Here, their re-use and general lack of ""cool"" factor makes them very aggravating. 
7. Story - Capcom has been making these things more serious, which I find at odds with RE4's story. RE4's story, much as I love the game, is [i]really[/i] dumb. But the original game played into that, leaned into it being a stupid silly thing as opposed to it being this serious, grounded and gritty game. It made a nice contrast between the more brutal combat (for the time). Here, it's just dour, downtrodden and bored without any sense of levity. It is also at odds with general gameplay things - Leon just has an ammo press to make ammo, Leon can just deflect a chainsaw with a kitchen knife... It's feels very tonally all over the place, with gameplay not matching the more serious nature of the remake's story
8. UI - Gone is the GPS/Computer-esque CODEC Leon used that aimed for immersion. Now it's just RE Engine slop like RE7, 8, and 2. That CODEC helped establish RE4's identity, and this feels far more soulless. It really misses the mark for what made RE4 so cool and fun, and doesn't portray Leon as the super spy as well when it's just a black and white menu with colored objects on it. The Typerwriter UI where it looked and functioned like a typerwriter is also gone completely and it is far worse by comparison. The end splash screen would also show 1-3 pictures of Leon and Ashley that were quite well rendered and fun to look at. This is absent as far as Chapter 3, so far. These things helped make RE4 very unique and flavorful, and their exclusion is painfully noted.
9. Censorship - so far, the line about ""Guess there's no gender discrimination here..."" is missing and I know the line about the President equipping his daughter with... Ballistics is also missing. Both lines served well to characterize the world and characters within it, and missing both of them is really bad. I genuinely hate this aspect of remake culture where they sand off all the edges and things people might not like. You do a lot of damage to the story and characters by doing that.

TL;DR - I find this remake to be worse in most ways compared to the original. Yes, there are parts I like and think are cool. But if you can stomach the objectively worse controls of the original, I think it's a far better game than the two hours I've played thus far. RE4 2005 felt like a passion project whereas this feels like something they made because they had to after making RE2R and RE3R... And because RE4 is the popular one that sells well.

I'll finish it out because I can't refund it, but thus far, I am hugely disappointed as big fan of the original game.",False,9,503

I knew the game would be good as the original is one of the best gamecube games I ever played, and the RE2 remake was amazing, therefore I was expecting a lot. I would have accepted a simple graphical and mechanic rebuild and been happy, but wow these devs did so much more than that. Not only does it look and perform amazing, the entire game was redesigned to feel modern. While keeping the spirit and feel of the original, I am not sure there is a single zone in this game that hasn't been redesigned for the better. There is more back-tracking and exploration, more secrets and side-objectives, better enemies and completely redesigned boss fights. This is not just a modern coat of paint and does not lean on its nostalgia at all, you can tell this was a full-scale project at Capcom.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,202034372,"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)
Classic gameplay perfection.

I never played the original or the HD version so I jumped in completely blind. The first chapters are mainly combat oriented; because you only get a handgun and the villagers offer no enemy variety, I found the start quite rough. After reaching the castle the game slowly shifted, there were more puzzles, more guns, more enemies and it turned into the perfect action adventure. Worth at full price.",True,0,1141
Resident Evil 4,2050650,202031994,"Resident Evil 4 is hands down the best game in the franchise by a large margin and a huge inspiration point for gaming. I can't believe the original was made in 2005, that blows my mind. No wonder why CAPCOM developers were afraid to do a modern remake, that game was way ahead of it's time and it shows. They still made it and oh boy, this turned out to be one of my favorite games of all times!

This game does everything near perfection, it's such a great experience to play it, it's action packed with lots of powerful and good feeling weapons, lots of tension moments and an amazing narrative story. Unlike the previous entries, Resident Evil 4 focuses less on the horror aspect and emphasizes more on the killing monster stuff. Leon is not the rookie from Resident Evil 2 anymore, he trained for 6 years to become a secret agent for the White House and his mission is to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley. There are a total of 16 chapters and in your first run it will take about 1 hour to complete each one if you are also exploring and I highly recommend doing that because the progress system in this game is so incredibly well done: you collect Pesetas (currency) from killing enemies, destroying crates or finding jewelry and sell it to the merchant. In fact, everything can be sold to get new weapons, upgrades or resources, but making the good combinations will give you the best bang for your buck. The game usually places you in larger open space areas and less inside buildings, which makes weapons like the Sniper Rifle a true powerhouse, but the trustworthy shotgun still packs a punch from close range and the best part is the upgrade system that really makes you feel rewarded for your exploration.

There are also a lot of other small quality of life improvements that really makes this game shine: having a generous inventory space right from the start (arguably the most annoying ""feature"" of RE2 and RE3), having a dedicated tab for key items (this and the previous one makes it a lot easier to mange your inventory), having prompts for recipees and not needing to memorize them, the kill confirmation once the enemy drops an item on the ground (in RE2 you could literally burst 20 pistol bullets in a zombie's head and unless you got a lucky critical hit, you'd never know if he's dead for good). Another strong point are the DLCs: the Mercenary Mode is just pure fun, you can play it for hours and kill Las Plagas left and right with 8 different characters + Separate Ways got to be one of the greatest additional content in any game, it keeps the same pace from the main game, it expands the story and you get to play from Ada Wong's perspective (it takes about 5 hours to complete). My only negative towards this game is that they didn't keep the silly jokes from the original and they cut some small pieces of content, like Luis Ballistics joke or the war against USA propaganda, so big L to all the whiners that asked for it (I hope they can still remake RE5 and ignore all the snowflakes). That's still a small price to pay for this masterpiece and it doesn't really impact my final verdict.

This game is a 10/10 in my book and I highly recommend playing it at least once for the story and more if you want to challenge yourself. This is worth the full price without a shadow of doubt and I wish I was a fan on release, but at least I can be there for future releases.",True,0,4577
Resident Evil 4,2050650,202028778,"Resident Evil is one of those franchises that I was fascinated by as a kid and only got to play when I was older. But despite having many opportunities as a teen, I put it on the backburner. 
As I fell in love with horror I found myself drawn to the new entries like RE7 and 8 but I still decided to give the earlier games a proper shot first.

Although I was dead-set on playing RE4 original, the remake just looked too good to deny and so I went with this first. What a fantastic choice. This is by no means disrespecting the original game, and I still plan on playing it eventually - but Resident Evil 4 Remake is an absolutely enthralling game.
If someone asked me ""what is the most exciting game to play as a newcomer to the medium?"" I would be hard-pressed to not immediately gush about RE4.

This game is filled to the gills with incredible action and setpieces. It has an incredible pace by which it dolls out encounters and challenges to the player and is by far one of the most expertly paced action titles I've played.
The story is simple compared to other RE games (based on my experience with the franchise) but it really drew me in and I found myself completely immersed and hooked.
It honestly never gets old going into a room and needing to take down hoards of Las Plagas infected villagers. In action games I tend to rely on an extremely limited amount of items and weapons because I just don't care for all the options the game offers me, but in RE4 I was constantly shifting weapons in my inventory, trying out everything, switching weapons on the fly in a panic when running out of ammo or needing to mow down enemies. All the weapons are fantastic.

I absolutely adore the difficulty scaling in this game.
Just when you get comfortable with the game and encounters, the devs almost sense that you need something unexpected to shake you up. The perfect example is the scene under the castle. PURE TERROR.

Maybe my love of hammy action films from my childhood made me gravitate towards RE4, but aside from the cheesy one-liners Leon spits and the over the top action hero sequences, this game truly deserves every bit of praise it gets.
This is all not even mentioning the REengine which has got to be the most incredibly optimised modern game engine I have played in. The visuals are consistently breath-taking and the game never had any issues with frame rate, lag or graphic quality.

By all means, this is a totally radical game that everyone should play.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201947155,"Uma excelente recriação que atualiza para o público moderno: os elementos de história, a gameplay e os gráficos. O jogo faz isso tudo sem abrir mão da essência do original.

Os desenvolvedores souberam usar a liberdade criativa na medida certa para trazer melhorias: a balística e o leque de movimentos do protagonista foram repensados e modernizados. Os chefes do RE4 original também ganharam novas versões, transformando os inimigos ruins em interessantes e lapidando ainda mais aqueles que já eram inesquecíveis.

Uma microcrítica: as armas são quase sempre substituíveis ao adquirir uma versão superior (por falta de propriedades diferentes). O jogo não estimula o jogador a usar mais de uma arma do mesmo tipo, há sempre uma melhor a ser adquirida e a antiga é descartada.

O maior problema da obra, para quem vos escreve, continua sendo algo herdado do material original: o excesso de competência e habilidades de Leon desde o início. Isso estabelece RE4 como um ótimo jogo de ação com elementos de terror, mas um péssimo Survival Horror (que o jogo se propõe a ser). Não há desafio e nem evolução da persona no protagonista, o jogo já começa com o mesmo sendo praticamente um sobre-humano.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201858451,"Took me 23 hours to complete my first playthrough of the game. Absolute peak.

I really enjoy the game a lot. The merchant missions are fun to do, the merchant in general is awesome to get new weapons and upgrade ones that you already own, and of course finding the treasures to sell, all very much fun and makes me greatly enjoy exploring the world!

I also enjoy the combat mechanics, they definetely make fighting a crowd more fun in this game compared to the previous games (RE2 and RE3 remakes), since you can actually reasonably fight back in this one.

While there are different suitcase upgrades, I genuinely foudn the increased handgun droprate suitcase to work the best for me since I suck at stealth and often run out of ammo fairly quickly if I don't have that one equipped.

Also I both like and get annoyed by Ashley. Like she is a fun character, and she can be helpful at times (opening up places to get treasures), but othertimes she just... gets annoying. Specifically when I tell her to keep close to run past enemies (or quickly run past the catapults), yet she is still somehow 5 kilometers behind me because she got stuck on god knows what.

Othertimes I tell her to keep away so I can figth enemies without her being hurt, yet she somehow is still quite close to me as if I never changed how close she was supposed to be... I don't know if others have the same issues or if my Ashley is just buggy, but it's quite annoying to deal with at times.

The regenerator section was awesome tho (the one where you first get introduced to them), was pretty scared first walking through that... until I got the thermal scope and just started blasting anyone I saw, lmao. Iron maidens were also pretty nice and added a few more stakes to fighting them.

The bossfights were awesome, especially loved the ones against Krauser, was finally able to use the full potential of my fully upgraded knife :D.

Also adored Luis and how kinda goofy he was at times (at least I found him kinda goofy sometimes, lmao). Ada was... well... Ada. I do preferred the voice actress for Ada in RE2 (remake) tho, this one sounds kinda just bored most of the time (this goes for the english version of the game)",True,0,2235

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201825125,"Resident Evil 4 Remake – My Review

The Resident Evil 4 Remake offers impressive visuals and maintains the core gameplay mechanics of the original. However, several issues detract from the overall experience.

Pros:

High-quality graphics that enhance the atmospheric tension.

Faithful recreation of the original's gameplay elements.

Cons:

Censorship: Many suggestive and flirty moments and dialogue with Ashley are removed or altered.

Character Design Changes: Ada Wong's outfit is censored; the ""boob window"" is removed, and Ashley's upskirt shots are eliminated.

Gameplay Downgrade: The remake does not offer smoother gameplay; it feels downgraded compared to the original.

Performance Issues: The inclusion of Denuvo DRM has been reported to cause performance problems on PC, including stuttering and frame rate drops, even on high-end systems.

Weapon Customization Limitation: The Blacktail handgun lacks a laser sight option, a feature present in the original.

Voice Acting: Ada's English voice acting is considered subpar by some players, leading to the use of mods for improvement.

Final Thoughts:
While the Resident Evil 4 Remake brings updated visuals and attempts to modernize the classic, the censorship, performance issues due to DRM, and other design choices may detract from the experience for some players.

Score: 6/10 – Visually appealing but hindered by technical and design flaws.",False,0,3303

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201784490,"After completing it, I'll try to boil down why I think you should play this.

1: It's unnecessary, but not unneeded. RE4's PC ports have pretty much all been awful, and the HD edition is literally the same version as the IOS one. The game does look better but quality of life changes make the whole experience a much smoother time, which in turn lets you drink in those old environments in the new flashy graphics. It's not a bad game at all.

2: You have already played RE4 and that's why you're reading these reviews. This game is different but not always better. Many famous moments have been switched around or changed slightly, usually just because they didn't just make exactly the same game again. For many those moments are very impactful and changing them is just ruining iconic moments for a profit. Those people aren't wrong. Some of the reworked scenes are better, but some are plain worse and they stick out more.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201749874,"This serves as a retrospective but still a review, more or less.
	From the achievements titled after many of iconic corny one-liners in the OG to the shooting range bonus time theme which will make you shed a tear of nostalgia, RE4R is a [b] beautifully-crafted love letter [/b] to all the 2005 fans, with even more replayability than the OG — all while being perfectly suitable for newcomers.
	It's wild how fans who had been skeptical about a 4 remake, came to love this more than the OG. Overall (putting nostalgia blindness aside), it IS  superior to OG, and man new Luis is just [b] PEAK [/b]. I love his new suave voice and how he stole more scenes than in the original becoming more than just comic relief. This time Ashley isn’t a pain in the ahh anymore, now with more realistic vulnerability and fear of getting possessed. Let's dive into it.

    [b] First thing you realize when opening the game is [/b] main menu is now night-dark instead of the og bright morning, conveying the change in the remake before you even play it. Storytelling is a big improvement over the OG which felt kinda isolated, we hear more about EU Umbrella, Luis, and Wesker. First cutscene explains a part of Leon's past, training and how he was assigned the mission. 

    [h2] 30 seconds... [/h2] 30 seconds is all it takes for the first ganado encounter. Everything feels familiar with an emphasis on a darker/scarier atmosphere. While a lot of games bore you with long prologues with dialogues, Resident Evil comes in to remind players that interactivity and enjoyable gameplay is what distinguishes games from movies. Immediate immersion into the action is not only unique, but also deep-rooted in the franchise. Take a look at the time it takes the classics to throw you in the chaos:
[list]
    [*]RE1: 10 seconds
    [*]RE2: INSTANTLY
    [*]RE3: INSTANTLY
    [*]RE4 OG: 15 seconds
[/list]

[quote=IGN] With all due respect to the likes of The Last of Us and God of War Ragnarok – which are both excellent in their own ways – Resident Evil 4 has no time for dialogue-heavy deep and meaningfuls. [/quote]

    [h2] The lake [/h2] is now a mini openworld section that you're free to backtrack into after Del Lago boss fight. The whole area is bigger in the remake and gives you a reason to spend some time doing merchant quests, solving new puzzles and searching for weapons, files, treasures, etc. It is a big jump in quality compared to OG where the whole lake area was hollow and not worth going back to after the boss fight because the church key is simply located in a generic area behind the waterfall with no puzzles. This time the key is locked behind 2 puzzles pieces you need to find while you explore the lake. 

    [h2] Combat [/h2] still feels tight and satisfying. Also worth mentioning that moving while aiming comes at the expense of some accuracy (unless you unlock a laser sight for a handgun) so most of the time you will find yourself aiming while standing still like the OG, it's a modern game yes but after all, it's not a Call of Duty.

    [h2] Crouching [/h2] is not only introduced for stealth purposes but also for combat. Early on, you encounter a new type of enemy called Brute wielding a sledgehammer madly swinging it around, requiring you to crouch down to evade it while the guy does you a favor mauling surrounding ganados. Also used to get around tripwire bombs, using them to your advantage.

    [h2] Enemies' AI [/h2] is better than expected. They are more aggressive and show some intelligence in their approach. When I tried camping up a ladder in the Fish Farm to throttle ganados, they didn't even wait to climb up and instead started throwing axes even though they can't see me.

    [h2] Stealth [/h2] RE4R introduces a rudimentary stealth system using crouch + knife takedowns, Sadly, Ganados AI is lacking at this point. There are some congested sections both in the main game and the DLC where you can stealth your way out which is very fun to have.

    [h2] Knives [/h2] The knife is overhauled in the remake, introducing around 5 main types of knives, varying in upgradable stats, i.e. damage, durability and attack speed, in addition to 2 basic disposable weaker knives you find around to temporarily rely on if your main knife is broken (more on that below). The new knives' system is one of the remake’s most praised additions for their many added benefits while still giving a sense of strategic resource/durability management. Some of these benefits are:
[list]
    [*]Parrying most attacks and thrown weapons.
    [*]Finishing off staggered enemies.
    [*]Killing knocked off twitching enemies preventing them from becoming Plaga heads.
    [*]Stealth kills.
    [*]The option to break out of grab attacks instead of wiggling out like in the OG.
    [*]Krauser's QTE knife duel cutscene has been transformed into a gameplay section reliant on parrying and counterattacking.
[/list]
     You got a gamelength-long quest shooting dolls resembling Salazar distributed around all 16 chapters, doing so rewards you with a very unique knife, that being the [spoiler] OG Primal Knife with an exclusive upgrade to become indestructible, although weaker than Krauser's knife [/spoiler].
     This enriches combat without compromising any of the challenge as these changes are balanced out by the depletable durability knives, with some actions wearing out knives more than others (e.g. Parrying the chainsaw man and the one-shot plaga zealot attack have the most effect on knives' durability) before breaking. Main knives are repairable at the merchant.

    [h2] Running [/h2] feels heavier (likely to tone down intensity of action and balance enriched combat) but you get used to it. Gone are the days of flying across the game with the Ditman Glitch, but hey at least they paid homage with a striker charm granting 8% movement speed.

    [h2] The Merchant [/h2] has a ton of voice lines. Spinels, instead of being a very common jewel in OG, are now the main currency you get from doing merchant quests (20 in total). The merchant has a new menu called (Trading) where you trade spinels for useful resources, weapons/weapon parts, treasures, etc.

    [h2] Shooting Range [/h2] is a lot better with more stages, earning higher ranking rewards you with tokens you drop in a machine to get charms of different tiers. You can hang up to 3 on your Attache Case to activate the charm passive.

    [h2] Attache Case [/h2] There are now 7 different kinds of them, each granting a passive bonus for diffrerent drops and crafting.

    [h2] Storage [/h2] The old storage box from the classic games is back, accessible through the typewriter menu and used to store weapons and first aid sprays. Super useful if you're planning to go NG+ as you won't need to sell any of your upgraded weapons for space.

    [h2] Files [/h2]: For the geeks who enjoy Resident Evil's files more than the main story, 4R features more files expanding on various and several topics not present in the OG. They won't disappoint.

    [h2] The Castle [/h2]  This is the most changed and improved of the 3 main stages of the game, and the one you will love the most. It has all the iconic areas of the OG castle, with several new beautiful areas, they all interconnect with different arrangement from the OG, this way you never know what the upcoming area will be.

    [h2] Ashley's playable section [/h2] is also massively improved. You can backtrack to this section as Leon to do quests or do puzzles to get weapons and so on.

    [h2] Backtracking [/h2] along with exploration in general is highly rewarded. You have different means to help you with that. Be it a special key or puzzle item used to unlock the several locked contraptions you come across earlier, or just getting Ashley to help you get to those out-of-reach areas.

46/46 achievements, Def would still do another run.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201612271,"This game is a masterpiece and improves upon the original Resident Evil 4 in almost every way, although there are cut sections and some of the goofyness the original had, those changes make more sense here and the good way outperforms the bad. And even better, The Separate Ways DLC includes the sections that were cut from the original game, but instead of playing them from the perspective of Leon, you play them as Ada Wong. And this DLC could perfectly be it's own full length Resident Evil game, with lots of content and serves as a way to solve some plot-holes from the main campaign.

Only few things I didn't like are the Salazar redesign and dialogues. Since he no longer looks like a creepy child, now more like a dwarf, and also doesnt personally speak to you via intercom but from speakers now, it feels like a downgrade to his character and personality.

This could be the best entry in the franchise, being so addictive to play, the gameplay very responsive, gorgeous graphics and highly replayable, I give it a 9.5/10. And the ending of the DLC sets up a possible remake for RE5, which I hope Capcom handles it some day.",True,1,1922

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201484409,"As a long-time fan of the original Resident Evil 4—my entry point into the franchise—I honestly can't describe how much I love this remake. The original game wasn't just a unique experience that sparked my interest in this genre, it has always held a special place in my heart. Back then, I didn’t have access to the older RE titles, and as the years went by, going back to the pre-RE4 entries became even harder.

Thanks to Capcom’s incredible remakes (let’s not count RE3 Remake), I’m really glad I was finally able to get a better understanding of the events leading up to RE4.

This remake is masterfully crafted. Every cut element from the original has been replaced with something better. Every chapter has been expanded upon, and best of all—there’s the Separate Ways DLC.

In the original game, Separate Ways felt like a lazy excuse to reuse assets and throw together a shallow campaign for Ada. But this time around, it delivers an experience that’s just as good—if not even better—than the main campaign itself.",True,1,3273

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201467991,"Wow. Just wow. I have never played the original RE4 and when starting this I was a bit sceptical at the beginning because I am usually no type for village settings. I knew it was often considered the best Resident Evil game but I usually want to make my own opinion. I was unsure if it was actually for me.

But it actually blew my expectations into orbit. It's one of the best games I have ever played!

Resident Evil 2 Remake is what got me into the franchise and so I had a pretty big bias towards that game. 
I did not expect it to be beaten in a long time. But here comes RE4 Remake and smashes my previous expectations into the ground. 

Despite it being pretty much ""Save the damsel in distress"", the character interactions as well as acting made the duo of Leon and Ashley pretty enjoyable! I think making her more mature in the Remake was 100% the right choice and it made me sympathise a lot with her. Leon being more serious after everything he has been through is also a nice upgrade, even tho many lines in the original are just legendary. 

The gameplay is very smooth and rewarding, it has insanely good gun play and also enjoyable variety in the weapons! 

Visuals and sound design are fantastic. The game is absolutely stunning looking, with music and sound effects adding wonders to the atmosphere. It's very good at capturing the horror of the plaga and the monsters it creates! Those have also been greatly visually upgraded from the original and offer the awesome body horror Resident Evil is so good at!

What I also really appreciate is the detail in Leon's model. In RE2 Remake, his facial features are softer, nicer looking. He has this touch of innocence and positivity. 6 years after the horrible events in Raccoon City, the RE4 Remake model makes his face look tougher. It has hardened, his eyebrows are significantly lowered, he has a permanent frown and his eyes have dark rings below them. Such details truly show the development Leon went through over the time skip and how much he has changed. This is peak story telling and character design and I am just in love with it.
 
Resident Evil 4 Remake is the prime example of a game people love nowadays. Yes, it is only a remake, however the changes and improvements it offers make it a game that other developers can take inspiration from. 

With 99.9% positives and 0.1% nitpicks about this game, I can confidently give Resident Evil 4 Remake a 10/10 and is in my opinion a must play for Survival Horror Lovers - especially people, that love Resident Evil!",True,1,2496

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201379860,"An incredible remake which pays tribute to the original while simultaneously being it's own masterpiece.

After 100% completing this game, and playing through the original a few times, I have found a new game to add to my favorites list. This game is a masterpiece, I'd wipe all my achievements and do the 100% all over again. (But who has the time?).

I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has or even hasn't played the original, because so much of both games are the same and kept that way. Going for all achievements is incredibly satisfying and rewarding, as well as a ton of fun.

For one, the graphics are incredible. Anyone with a good pc or better will marvel at the new shiny details. The gunplay is also phenomenal, and unlocking all the upgrades is worth every penny. 

Running through the game on subsequent NG+ runs is a blast, you get to keep most of your items from the previous playthrough. All your guns and upgrades will stay in your inventory. (Also a few secret weapons that make the game difficulty laughable!).

Separate Ways could very well be its own game! Playing as Ada is a nice breakaway from the main game, with the bonus of a grappling hook.

I will definitely be coming back to replay this masterpiece year after year, and I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the franchise or looking to start!",True,0,4182

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201340846,"Another great installment in the RE Remakes series. As usual, these games show us that optimization is still possible by developers who really try. Each and every one of these games has ran flawlessly on my PC, this time around even with ray tracing on I was still at a solid 60 fps at 1440p, never once experiencing a frame drop throughout my playthrough. This alone should continue to make these games stand out.

Gameplay also continues to be fun and engaging. The shops system in this game keeps things interesting with exchanging and upgrading weapons along the way, while managing space makes you have to choose your arsenal carefully.

There's very few complaints about this game. Leon's dialogue can be so bad it's comical at times, and yet I loved hearing whatever he had to say next. My only real issue with the game is [spoiler] the lack of recurring monsters like RE2 and RE3 had. Leon faces many grotestque bosses, yet all of them are defeated after the first standoff with them. There isn't a big man that keeps showing up and chasing you, Leon takes on the boss fight and then moves on. Not a bad thing, but it was different from the other games, the reappearance of a scary, unstoppable boss had a nice buildup to the final fights of RE2 and RE3. [/spoiler]

This is a good one though, and on sale for $20 is great.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201337860,"This is a good game, no doubt about it, its a remake of a classic. But I'm giving it a downvote because it could have been a lot better.

PROS:
- Good graphics.
- Additional content.
- Not exactly the same game (different layout, some new enemies).
- The knife has more usability.

CONS:
- Again very limited modding capability because Capcom wants to sell its DLC costumes, weapons and Ada's campaign (didnt even make many DLC content).
- It would have been nice to have new areas instead of only changing the layout of rooms.
- Some content got cut out for some reason.
- A good feature for this game would have been Wall Leaning since many enemies have projectiles.
- The CQBR Assault Rifle is kinda disappointing since its not used as expected--an assault rifle. Instead its designed to be used as a marksman rifle and therefore have a low amount of ammo.
- The devs once again made Ashley an annoying character to protect. She wont run away from danger but instead will stand in the middle of enemies.
- Luis also doesn't run away from danger and gets damaged unnecessarily.
- Not many good DLC content, and they removed Ashley's armour costume.
- Multiplayer would have been a good addition.

Item drops are generous enough that taking down enemies is rarely a struggle. Because of that, even the highest difficulty mode — Professional — isn't overly challenging to beat.

Unlike the Resident Evil 2 remake, this game allows the use of unlimited ammo weapons to achieve an S+ rank (though, of course, you’ll need to fully upgrade them first). One standout feature is the parry and deflect mechanics, which are surprisingly well done and feel inspired by Souls-like games.

That said, I still find some aspects of the game a bit ridiculous. For example, how does a girl who can’t even fight back when being kidnapped suddenly know how to operate a giant crane? It doesn’t make much sense!

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201294464,"Resident Evil 4 is the latest series of remakes produced by Capcom after the releases of Resident Evil 2 and 3 in 2019 and 2020 respectively. After the previous, albeit they were quite short, sensational creations, I didn't expect Resident Evil 4 to be any different compared to its predecessors at all. The experience was totally different from the ones of RE 2 and 3, which played on certains parts of the devastated city of Racoon. You are thrown into a rural area controlled by insane, vicious and mercyless cultists seeking to take over the entire planet. The gameplay is faster and much more action-oriented compared to the two previous games. It hardly ever felt like even a single minute was wasted with just sneaking around and stumbling across nothing. That means the whole 15-20 hours of gameplay are fully utilized.

Enemies move in a dangerous, erractic manner and having them overwhelm and surrounding you happens so quickly that you can never really feel safe, so making snap decisions when it comes to prioritising targets is extremely important. You also have to be aware of the surface you're walking on, as it's not uncommon to get your foot stuck in a bear traps, which can turn out to be very problematic, especially during a fight. You might have a very expansive tollset, but that doesn't mean you can afford to lose focus or be unaware of your surroundings.
A one-size fits all strategy doesn't work in this game, as the enemies can suddenly pull up with shields or helmets forcing you to use different styles how to exterminate the hostile targets.

What starts as a very straightforward rescue mission, with Leon Kennedy being tasked to locate and free the US President's missing daughter, Ashley, soon turns into a heart-stopping series of bloody clashes against giant sea monsters, crazed hordes in boarded up cabins and bloodythirstly, possesed cultists in and around a heavily fortified castle, skulking sections through shadowy laboratories, explosive and thrilling minecart chases and countless run-ins with some twisted and insane freaks infected with the dangerous Las Plagas parasite.

Additionally it's noteworthy to mention how terrifying and frightening the audio design is. When it comes to a cultivating sense of dread, that game almost belongs to the ""unreachable"" category. Whether it's the manic chanting of the parasite-mutated peasant farmers or the snarl of wolvees as they wander through the area around you in the castle's confusing hedge maze. All of which had me at the edge of my seat, you can believe that.

When you need to take a breather in order to restack your ammo, heal up, get recipes to craft exact desired ammo types, increase the capacity of your case or simply purchase new weapons, a mysterious merchant always having a saying ready, returns to give Leon the chance to get fully equipped before moving on to the next chapter. Furthermore, you can complete certain tasks (e.g. shooting down hidden blue medallions, killing a small amount of rats in certain, small areas, tracking down a rare golden chicken egg) written down on flyers distributed across the whole map in exchange for spinel gemstones which can be traded for unique items and upgrades.

The question whether to give this game a shot or not is a total no-brainer. It's just the perfect fit for action-horror fans. The  world is just so beautifully designed with lots of surprises, fun, plently of explorable areas and tasks to be completed. To be honest, I didn't particuarly like this game at the beginning, because I'm not the biggest fan of this cult, medieval-like stuff and clearly prefer the atmosphere, world and vibe of the Resident Evil 2 and 3 games. The design of the inventory is also something I didn't particular like and I clearly preferred the one from RE 2 and 3 as well. Moreover, the different mixtures of yellow, red and green herbes was way to confusing. However, this game finally started to grow on me during chapter 11, from which I had an intense 3.5 hour stint till the end of chapter 13. From then on I was glad to not have given up on that masterpiece to early.",True,45,5360

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201275541,"Mostly an amazing game. Some may see it as more of a shooter, but as a newish player to the genre, going through on standard was a little challenging with a death or two per chapter. Never felt tedious like it was in re2r (while playing re2r, I had to run back in forth because my inventory filled up with items every single room  or repeatedly retracing your steps because of a somewhat convoluted puzzle)

Beyond that, the ability to now upgrade your chosen weapons gave me (and I assume other players) to adjust their preferred playstyle and favored weapons, which adds to the whole experience. Game still has a lot a horror moments with certain enemies. Along with that comes with reason for map exploration.

Characters and story was interesting and fun.

As for the cons, it's honestly a bit nitpicky:
-There are a few instances towards the end where a cutscene happens, and then your character's position get thrown into a 'cage', and by the time you gain control of the character again, multiple enemies are already rushing at you from every direction. Honestly was very disorienting, and felt like a cheap way to create 'desperation'.",True,0,2173

Resident Evil 4,2050650,201250934,"my name is slit, welcome.

i’ve played the resident evil 2 remake, 3 remake, 7, and 8. i 100%'d part 3 and 7
resident evil, to me, has always stood on two legs: survival or horror or let's say mixed between the two. 

then along came re4 remake.
this game doesn’t give a damn about either. it’s not survival, it’s not horror—it's a third-person shooting gallery wearing a resident evil costume. it plays like doom without the metal soundtrack, without the adrenaline, and without the charm. just a never-ending stream of mindless enemies charging at you, and you spray bullets until your brain turns to oatmeal. rinse, repeat.

you want fear? tension? resource management? atmosphere? too bad.
what you get is a million spanish villagers with pandemic-grade aggression storming you like it’s black friday, and you’re the last guy with toilet paper.

if i wanted to play something like this, i would’ve loaded up doom eternal. at least doom knows what it is. it embraces the chaos and gives you carnage with style.
resident evil 4 remake? it’s stuck somewhere between a john wick movie and a low-effort anime filler arc.

now let’s talk about the character you play:
you’re leon—some supposedly badass american agent. except he's not. he's a walking anime trope with the emotional depth of a tea spoon. clearly written to bait people who think eren yeager is a personality type.
“oooh, he’s so cold.”
no. he’s boring.

but let’s be honest slit—no one plays resident evil for the dialogue, right? okay cool.

gameplay? let me draw it for you:
loot.
70 villagers charge at you.
kill them.
walk 3 steps.
70 new villagers show up.
kill them.
go to a new area that looks like it was built by someone asleep at the keyboard.
guess what? more loot.
guess again: 70 more villagers.
think you know what’s next?
nope. no loot this time—just ashley.

ashley: the gameplay downgrade nobody asked for.
once she shows up, the already repetitive combat becomes a babysitting simulator.
it’s like escorting a cracked-out npc through a war zone while trying not to lose your mind.
and at that point, you finally understand why gavi fucked the spanish princess and dipped.
just play re4 and it’ll all click.

story? what story?
every cutscene feels like it was written by someone who has alzheimer disease.
you kill a horde of enemies, get a pointless cutscene, ada shows up, vanishes, ashley gets kidnapped again (surprise!), and the loop begins anew.

if you’re into plot progression, character arcs, or stakes.. this game offers none.
it’s just: shoot...  cutscene.... ashley screams.... repeat.
you could fall asleep between encounters and not miss a single narrative beat.

but wait... there was one, one, actually great moment.
there’s a section where you play as ashley alone.
leon’s locked up (thanks god) and you have to save him.
you’re armed with nothing but a flashlight, and suddenly.. finally... the game remembers it’s supposed to have horror elements.
the area design is tight. the atmosphere is creepy. the gameplay is actually engaging.
i was really shocked and i said to myself: DAMN SLIT.. even in a pile of shit, sometimes you strike gold. it felt like i was playing resident evil.

and i’ll say this: that one section is one of the best areas in the entire franchise. deriod.
but it lasts, what, 15 minutes? then it’s back to the spray-n-pray fiesta.

final thoughts?
this is the worst resident evil game i’ve ever played.
i don’t care how much praise it gets. that just proves one thing:
the fanbase is full of sheep with zero taste.
trust a brainless donkey before you trust a fanboy shill.
would’ve been better throwing my money in the trash, at least then the trash would’ve had purpose.",False,4,775

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200962953,"Resident Evil 4 Remake has cemented Capcom in the modern age as the premier gaming company re imaging IP for new generations.  While RE2 Remake proved it was possible(lets ignore RE3), RE4 was such an iconic and transformative game for the genre that bringing it back would be a herculean task.  The OG immersive 3rd person survival horror.  The RE2 Remake brought that immersion to the second game, and this time, Capcom has brought back the King.  Outside of maybe Evil Within 1, I have never played a 3rd person horror game with so much variety in gameplay, environments, enemy types and bosses.  This is an epic horror in all the best ways, and a masterclass in encounter design, quality animations, and excellent melee systems.   Movement is weighty, guns feel impactful, and just about every aspect of the gameplay is best in class.  RE4 always stradled the line of action and horror in a compelling way, creating the blueprint for the Last of Us and Evil Within.  Hopefully if Capcom continues the Remake trend, they try to bring 5 or 6 back more in line with what they have done here.",True,0,5308

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200959853,"This game upgraded the restricted graphics and controls of the original to look similar to the remakes of RE2 and RE3. The story was tweaked a bit to be more realistic and to make Ashley less of an annoyance. She is way more useful now and doesn't put herself in the middle of a shootout. The iconic lasersight now is an addon for some specific weapons and it must be bought at the merchant. All the weapons use a dynamic crosshair now. The bosses are more unpredictable, some enemies have better reflexes, new moves and can sometimes still survive without head until you finish them off.
I've replayed both the original version and this one to infinity without getting tired once. To me this is a perfect remake just like RE2.

To start off, I have 100% percent the main game and have seen all there is to see.
The gameplay is fun and engaging the entire time. It's not quite a horror game in my book, but the action and dialog are what really sells this game! 
Leon has already lived through a zombie apocalypse once and this time, he isn't taking none of it's BS. He ready to kick, shoot, and suplex anything that gets in his way. All the while, he is delivering witty but cheesy dialog along the way.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200886851,"Well, 2 years since I bought it and 150 total game hours later, I finally got the S+ achievements done for both Leon (Main) and Ada (Separate Ways). Yes I did buy the upgrade tix, and they were critical to my achievements run. Better players probably won't need them but I wasn't good enough; I simply lack the memory capacity and reflexes I've had years ago. 

The RE4 Remake is a fine polished game on its own and with respect to the original... It has a much better UI, UX, and player controls. The Tetris is no longer mandatory and auto arrange will do the work for the player. Some people may complain about the dialogue, but it was whatever for me.

I was blown away by the release of the original Resident Evil 4, and I didn't think that a remake was needed. However, I was surprised by how good the remake is. It improves upon many aspects of the original, including gameplay. It may be similar to the original, especially the combat, but I am so glad that they made a lot of things different, such as the settings. The environments and boss fights seem familiar, but they are different enough to make the experience of the game refreshing. The game does feel easier than the original, but I might be biased about that because I put in countless hours playing the original.  

The control is no longer rigid as it is in the original. The original required you to stand still to fire a weapon, but the remake allows you to move while shooting. The game also allows you to quickly select weapons in the game with your D-pad if you're playing on a controller, or with the number keys if you're on a PC, so you don't have to switch to the menu and pause the game, something that hurt immersion in the original version. Also, the developers did an amazing job making Leon's character animation look fluid and natural as he moves around while you're controlling him. 

What this remake did WAY better than the original is that it built a stronger aspect of horror, while maintaining a good balance of action. You find yourself navigating in dark corridors and pitch black dungeons. It keeps you guessing what kind of monsters lurk in the dark.  

What I also love is that stealth is added to the gameplay. Unlike the original, you can sneak behind enemies one by one and take them out silently without alerting the rest of them. Although you cannot travel through the areas relying solely on stealth, I am glad that you have more options to deal with the challenges an area presents. 

This is a nitpick, but the main villain is not as compelling as the original. In the original, he had more screen time and had a very snarky and sinister persona. You love to hate him. However, the one in the remake is more one-dimensional and bland. Thus, he is just a standard movie villain that I've seen countless times and doesn't stand out. 

The remake does polish some aspects of the story. It gives a backstory to certain characters so they have more depth. I don't want to go into more details to avoid spoiling anything. 

Overall, this game is great for people who love survival horror, whether or not they played the original. Just like the original game, it throws you into extremely perilous situations that get your adrenaline pumping. And its improvements on the original make it a refreshing experience for fans of the original RE4, which I argue is the best in the franchise.",True,1,7859

It took me I think 12 hours to play through the campaign and less than 4 for separate ways(I dont think pausing counts) so longer than re2 and re3 combined. I do wish there was a way to replace ashley's AI with luis's because it would be fun to have a combat companion at all times.

Playing on normal the game isnt hard and combat feels actually fun. Aside from 2 moments the game isnt scary at all and actually kinda funny thanks to comments the characters make. I hope capcom makes more remakes like these - or the upcoming re requiem will be like this and less like re 7 or 8. Action and explosions - very fun. 

Also the last boss was on par with all other resident evil bosses. Very action oriented. Wish more weapons had infinite ammo though. Somethimes you just wanna mow down enemies without care. Also lack of ,,unlock-all"" DLC is a massive set back. I dont wanna play though 100 times just to unlock everything. I hope that comes back with another resident evil.",True,0,1782

Resident Evil 4 Remake is a near-perfect reimagining of one of the most iconic action-horror games ever made. It modernizes everything — from combat and visuals to character depth — while staying faithful to the tone, pacing, and absurd charm of the original. Whether you're a veteran or newcomer, this is essential survival horror.

Pros:

Incredible third-person combat with smooth gunplay and satisfying feedback

Gorgeous visuals, atmospheric lighting, and improved level design

Expanded story and character moments, especially for Ashley and Luis

Smart reworks to puzzles, boss fights, and pacing

New parry and stealth mechanics add variety

High replay value with New Game+, Challenges, and Mercenaries Mode

Cons:

Some iconic lines and campy moments were toned down or changed

Knife durability might annoy players early on

A few boss encounters are less memorable than the original

Final Thoughts:
This isn’t just a remake — it’s a redefining of what a remake should be. Capcom nailed it. RE4 Remake respects its legacy while boldly pushing the franchise forward. Action, horror, and cheese — perfectly blended.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200700332,"Alright, so I finally got around to playing the Resident Evil 4 Remake, and holy moly, they absolutely nailed it! As someone who's played the original countless times, I was a bit worried they'd mess it up, but nope – they actually made it better.

First off, it looks incredible. The village, the castle, the island – everything is just jaw-droppingly detailed and atmospheric. It really makes the horror hit harder when everything looks so grimy and unsettling. The sound design is top-notch too; hearing those Ganados muttering in the distance or the chilling whispers of the ""it"" creature genuinely gave me goosebumps.

The combat feels fantastic. The controls are super fluid, which is a massive upgrade. And the knife parry? Oh my god, that's a game-changer! It turns frantic close-quarters moments into these epic, desperate struggles where you can actually fight back with style. Learning to time those parries properly felt so rewarding. It really encourages you to get in there and mix it up, instead of just backing away and shooting.

They also did a great job with the story and characters. Leon feels a bit more grounded, and Ashley is less annoying this time around, which is a huge plus. Even characters like Luis feel more fleshed out. They kept the cheesy charm of the original but balanced it with a more serious, darker tone that fits the horror perfectly.

Honestly, my only tiny gripe is that some of the darker areas can be a bit too dark even with the brightness up, but that's a minor thing. Overall, if you loved the original, you're going to adore this. And if you've never played RE4 before, this is absolutely the best way to experience it. It's a masterclass in how to remake a classic.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200471430,"While this remake marks a drastic tonal shift from the original and cuts a few corners, it still stands strong on its own thanks to a satisfying combat system and dense atmosphere.

The story takes a more grounded, believable approach, with characters that are less over-the-top than in the original — and in my opinion, the remake delivers the horror aspect more effectively. While it's not Resident Evil 7 levels of terrifying, some moments are genuinely unnerving.

Combat feels precise and rewarding. It borrows some elements from RE7, like the initial spread when aiming, but tightens up quickly to reward patience and accuracy. The addition of a parry system using the knife adds more depth and dynamism to encounters.

That said, the Mercenaries mode takes a bit of a hit. The more ""realistic"" combat fits well in the main campaign but feels off in an arcade-style setting like this. The original’s more pinpoint-style shooting was simply a better fit here.

I don’t see this remake as a replacement for the original, as some people claim — but rather as a solid and enjoyable reimagining that stands proudly beside it.",True,0,1104

This is by far my favourite in the franchise, and although it is only a remake of RE4, I personally believe that it builds upon everything the original does and ultimately makes it a better game. I understand that there are many RE fans who prefer the original, and although I personally believe that the original is still a great game, I think that preference mostly comes from nostalgia.

While I missed out on the original, I do feel like this game pays respect to it while also enriching it with lore that wasn't available at the time and adding more depth. The game plays well, is enjoyable, authentically Resident Evil, and not too long. 

This game brings plenty of challenge even on standard difficulty with the swift enemies and survival elements at play. The first person view and lack of tells means you could very well get enemies sneaking up on you as well. If you play the game blind you will find yourself with plenty of opportunity to push yourself. Things can be missed. There are some enemies you may not know how to dispose of without a bit of advice. There are situations you may be better off not fighting. Everything is there to push you in a controlled manner.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200242809,"Resident evil 4 is a fantastically well-put together game that manages to include new aspects of gameplay without straying far from the original game. As a hardcore fan of the resident evil remake series, I believe that this is one of the best survival horror RE games in the franchise. 

The first major improvement from the original game is definitely the Ashley AI, going from players treating her as a nuisance, to actually making players want to protect her. I particularly love Ashley's realistic character development and growth as she journeys with Leon Kennedy, coming to trust him over time and be useful in her own way. Aside from Ashley, other characters also feel realistic and natural in conversations, movement and behaviour. Enemies are well-modelled as well and most bosses all feel unique in their own ways and have unique battles, I especially love the knife-fight and ""obstacle course"" with Krauser.

Aside from incredible graphics and characters, the soundtrack generally suits the game just right, allowing for tensions at the right moments (especially around later chapters when *THEY* make their appearance) and less tense situations (with our dear merchant) + hardcore music during the boss fights. However, there are occasional times where the soundtrack sounds awkward (E.g: Sudden fighting village ost when you’re standing at a safe sniper distance out of view). The plot sails smoothly from chapter to chapter, with few chapters feeling redundant or unnecessary, and nice switches of game style from the village, to the castle, and eventually the Island. Lastly, voice-acting is top-tier for characters like Leon and Ashley, I LOVE the emotion that their voices carry. However, other characters like Ada feel slightly unnatural and unsuitable for the character, especially compared to her VA for RE2.

Having said that, one of the major problems RE4 faces is difficulty, which is almost abnormal in harder difficulties like hardcore of professional. RE uses the difficulty adjustment (DA) system, which varies depending on how well the player does. E.g: Player is overloaded with supplies, defeating optional challenging enemies like brutes -> DA points skyrocket, making the game MUCH more challenging (stronger enemies, damage taken, supply drops etc...) On professional, this game is INSANELY difficult, especially if one attempts the S+ run, with many enemies having the ability to one-shot or stunlock the player, along with the 15 save and 5h30 time limit. I can confidently say that most gamers will certainly feel frustrated trying to play professional on NG+, especially without learning all the tricks required/ following a walkthrough. 

For new players who come for the plot and enjoyment, I recommend playing assisted/ standard despite the DA system as the difficulty is still relatively easy for those modes. 

Characters: 9/10 (Only Saddler’s character falls slightly short as a final boss)
Art: 10/10 (Absolutely fantastic graphics and art style, the concept art is immaculate)
Gameplay: 8/10 (Great for a survival horror fan, however the DA does mess with the experience for hardcore and professional)
Soundtracks: 9/10 
Plot: 9/10 

Final rating: 9/10

Music is underwhelming sure but thats easily fixed by toggling the original soundtrack, (thankfully without needing an additional purchase like RE2 remake, showing Capcom learns from mistakes), and truthfully there's very little that I can say that'd dissuade anyone from wanting to experience this extremely well made game.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200190411,"Decided to update this review after beating the game on Hardcore about three times, almost four-- which I will get back to why it is almost four-- my enjoyment has hardly increased and I have found even more reasons to not like this game. What I immediately want to say is how frustratingly long it takes for this POS to boot up and how long it takes to load into save files, which is supposedly tied to how many save files you have. That would be fine...ish, it's annoying and quite shitty but hey, you can just delete the save files-- Just not in game though :) 

Awesome choice Capcom, that's really fucking cool actually, thank you for that. You made the game harder, made resources stricter, which are very good changes, love the fact this remake has more player accountability! Remake makes this game more like the original survivor horror titles, but in those titles, you often saved in multiple locations in the chance that you may have or eventually will put yourself in an unwinnable situation, requiring you to go back to an older save. I had that happen a couple times which I had no problems with, but that was when the game wasn't taking three fucking years to load into each save and when I had less save files! Why can't you delete them in game? Why was that a choice actively made??? I don't even have mods installed so that can't be the sole reason it is taking so long! I am actively trying to load into one of them as I type this lmao 

The other problem, the one that has been absolutely detrimental to my enjoyment of these games, the one that has killed any desire or urge to replay the prior remakes is the guns; everything about them is painfully unsatisfying. The sounds are weak, the sensation of hitting an enemy with them feels limp, like I'm shooting a paintball gun at wet sacks of flour. The enemy animations upon impact are just so heavy and wet in a way that kills any enjoyment the gunplay may give. The shotguns in these remakes are the ones most damaged by this pernicious little problem, they feel like ass, they're horribly inconsistent at blowing someone's head off-- which is something that I kinda don't like in OG RE4 admittedly-- but in this game, that happens more often, even when they are not upgraded! I know for a fact the guns are doing damage because I can see the corpses I'm leaving, I can see the exploding heads but man, I don't get to enjoy any of that when every enemy running at you is a wet sack of flour instead of a being made of flesh. Enemy animations suck, they are so heavy and hit you with a wet plap - there is no catharsis in meleeing an enemy, there is no crunchy, meaty sensation when an enemy's axe digs into Leon's shoulder. 

It's just unreal to me how they managed to fix one issue I had with the remakes, the guns not really doing anything to the enemies, but did not fix how shitty it feels to shoot guns in a third person, over the shoulder shooter :/

Speaking of being an over the shoulder shooter! Why is the aim zoom unmodded so closed in on you? You have a lot more enemies coming at you in EVERY single arena so what is that supposed to achieve? The aiming system and aim camera zoom is ripped straight out of the prior remakes without any consideration in how it effects a game that is way more open - the arenas you are fighting in are much larger but they often feel 3x smaller because of this shitty zoom - game is nauseating like this, I NEEDED to install the no aim zoom mod, game was and is genuinely unplayable for me without it.  

I want to say some things I actually like about the game, there is a lot more that I like than I actively hate but, those things that I hate ruin the entire package for me.

I love how willing and eager Capcom were in screwing with the player in the same way RE1R did, an RE game that is significantly better than 7,8, and every other project they have released for this series since 2017. Arenas have been retooled in pretty significant ways - some locations and the way you traverse them have  been reversed and or expanded upon - many of them were pretty insignificant in the original game and I am quite glad I get to see a better, bigger version of them. The double Garrador room is absolutely a highlight of this game - it blows the original fight out of the water. Ashley is a lot harder to protect in this game, which many reviews have described as being a bad thing, and yeah, wrangling her is much clunkier but I hardly had issues with the changes - it made her a variable I actively had to take into account more often which led to her and the game to be more engaging. Pool Room, which was not a room I found all that challenging in the original, is harder in this game and the enemies harass you in it to an annoying (affectionately using the word here) degree. The Bolt Action Rifle and the Stingray are the only guns in this game that do not feel like dick to shoot, very fun guns with great reload animations and sound effects <33  

The game is hard and is tuned pretty well on Professional, enjoyed the difficulty immensenly. The change to enemy stuns I am kinda iffy about? - I like that one headshot is not a guaranteed stun anymore but sometimes, even three is not enough - it just feels really bad and stupid when half or more of my unupgraded pistol mag was required to get a tiny amount of breathing room. Will say however that this is mostly an early game problem, so I hardly consider it a significant flaw and mostly an okay change. I like that the stun change forces me to be in a more reactive headspace than the predictive one in OG RE4. The Armaduras are really fun in this game, I like that the parasite is exposed immediately and that it requires precise aiming to expose them further. There is a request that involves fighting an even tougher gold one and man, that was absolutely sick. Iron Maidens have a bigger presence in this game which is kinda nice - they were very forgettable in OG in my opinion. 

My god, the shooting range in this game is absolutely incredible - it is flat out better than the original and the rewards are too, love the charms in this game. I honestly found it more fun than the main game. 

Obviously the game looks nice, not really all that impressed by a pretty game like this but it does deserve some props I guess. Music is nice too, but I like the original OST way more for its ambient tracks.

I like Mercenaries in this game, it is as close as I can get to playing a fun version of RE4R but it is also significantly easier than the main game which is not what I want. 

This game loses just about everything in its gameplay that made the original so snappy and enjoyable to replay. Leon doesn't move like a person, he just kinda staggers and limps everywhere even when he is not hurt - there was no need to add inertia to his movement especially when you've added a new mechanic where enemies you've downed can mutate where a prompt will pop up that allows you to kill them before that happens - I missed that a lot because Leon will stop 30 seconds after you let go of W, which leads to an enemy turning into a much more dangerous one because they thought it was a good idea to make Leon not move like a normal fucking human. 

Edit: Forgot to mention Separate Ways; it's a waste of fucking time lmao - It feels like a mod made by semi competent devs instead of an actual campaign expansion. Every room and arena feels lifeless and barren - U-3's arena sucks and the new second phase is ass - U-3 sucked in the original too so they stayed pretty faithful. There is hardly anything to say about it  other than the crossbow is cool, waow, what an accomplishment :/ - My save files for Separate Ways was the reason I couldn't load into any saves in a decent time, once I was able to nuke them from my PC, I was able to load into every single one of my saves in 5-10 seconds, incredible work from the team that brought us Resident Evil 3 Remake :)",False,7,6139

The lighting is great; the sound design is great; the environments are great; many sections are given more gameplay depth; the mechanics feel less janky than the original; the voice acting is hugely improved, especially from Ashley and Luis.  New Ashley makes you want to help her out of understanding her horrible situation and good intentions, not because you are required for your mission.  My only artistic gripes with the game are occasional where the original did 1 small scene or interaction slightly better than the remake, and for some reason Ada's voice acting just feels off.  On the whole, however, the remake improves basically every aspect of the original game.

My main dislike of the remake is honestly the shooting range sections--I think the shaky aim and bloom mechanics mesh horribly with a minigame centered around being a sharpshooter.  I also think the final fight against Saddler is too easy, and aspects of the Island area feel out of place in a resident evil game (although, same with the original game I guess).

My god they did it. They made this game even better than the original and you can see all the effort and care the devs put into this game. They knew they were handling very precious material and ensured that they would not fumble the outcome. This game is incredible everything has been improved upon. The graphics, the character design, the game play from movement to implementation of new mechanics, the gun play, they added new weapons, and a crafting system, they improved the level design, the story, and pacing, they improved the shooting gallery, and added key chains that give you buffs. There are new areas with new puzzles, new challenges that let you buy special items within the store. There is so much more. I am baffled at how they were truly able to improve upon an amazing game to the extent that they were able to produce such a masterful product that once again shocked the industry showing everyone how it's done when it comes to improving upon an already amazing product.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,200036679,"After Warcraft 3: Reforged I have been hesitant to approach remakes. This was the only one from the franchise where I had played the original game. Thankfully they not only honored it, they expanded and improved upon it. 

The graphics and combat are updated to modern standards with some additions. You have access to a parry, which allowed them to add more complexity to enemies and bosses. Most of the quick time events that frustrated me in the original were replaced with this.

Levels that dragged like the castle were trimmed, and others were expanded such as the lake area, which made for perfect pacing.

The escort sections are far less frustrating. Ashley no longer has a health bar, and you can call for her to stick to you or play more passive. She is also more self-reliant, no longer screaming at you to drop off ladders.

They shifted the tone to be more serious than the original. It works in some ways and not others. It complements the horror better, and characters such as Luis and Ashley are given more depth, but other characters such as Salazar feel out of place. I understand why the phone conversations were removed, but they needed to be replaced with something.

Most of the things I was sad were removed ended up being moved to the DLC, which is more fleshed out and enjoyable than the original.

The atmosphere was intense, the horror elements were just right—not too over the top but definitely kept me on edge. The puzzles were clever and satisfying to solve, and the exploration made the game feel deeper than just running and shooting. What I really liked was how the story slowly unfolded and pulled me in.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199800889,"I always saw the original Resident Evil 4 on nearly every YouTuber’s list of “best games ever made” or “most influential games of all time.” I was told it was a classic because it revolutionized the action-horror genre—with its over-the-shoulder camera, intense combat, and smart enemy design. It struck a perfect balance between survival horror and fast-paced action, delivering a fresh experience that was both terrifying and incredibly fun.

While I never played the original, I now have finished this remake (still working through the DLC), and I can now fully understand the praise. The pacing, the action set pieces, the gunplay, and the atmosphere are some of the best I’ve ever experienced in a game. The characters are beautiful and lovable—Ada, Ashley, and the absolute goat Luis totally won me over. And oh boy, Leon’s cockiness and those ridiculous backflips—it's such a joy to watch every cutscene.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199790023,"I've been waiting to play this game for quite some time, but at first glance, what surprised me was the graphic quality. They really excelled at it.
I like the movement and the mechanics they implemented, like the knife theme (I know many don't like it, but personally, I do). I've played Resident Evil 4 from 2004 quite a bit, and this new Resident Evil represents it very well. The cinematics are very well-animated and clean. You can feel Leon's emotions and way of thinking. Regarding Leon, his personality has changed. He went from being charismatic to more serious and depressed. I don't mind the change. I feel like I can identify with the character better because he's more ""realistic.""
Leon's campaign was pretty good. They removed some important things from the campaign, although some other mechanics returned in Ada's campaign, so it makes up for it a bit.
Mercenary mode is fun. I'm not a big fan of it, but I really liked the one in this game, so they did pretty well.
As for the DLC, I would only recommend buying the Treasure and Ada DLCs; I don't think the rest are worth it.

As for the plot. In my opinion, it's too drawn out and it feels like Leon's storyline itself is not authentic. When he was just a cop (in the second part) it was more true and organic than when he was a saccharine superhero. It's somehow pop, and, let's be honest, the plot itself is very drawn out.

By getting achievements and playing the game good you get fun unlocks and cosmetics some that actually enhance your gameplay. (Ex: less damage taken, infinite ammo..) Overall this game is absolutely fantastic in terms of just about everything all around. To me it's worth it full price, (though it goes on sale for around 20 bucks sometimes.)

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199712208,"When I was a kid, RE4 pretty much disappointed me, but I didn't really understood why at the time. People that dislike the game usually say that there's too much B-Movie over the top action. And while it's true, Resident Evil always has been Action Horror to me (compared to Silent Hill).
In 2025, I just finished the Remake and even if I still don't like it that much, I think I know why.

First of all, RE4R IS a good game. It really is. Everything's fine and you should play it.

But today I know why something feels off with this game.
Resident Evil 1/2/3 were Action Horror games that played like a Horror game.
Resident Evil 4 and 5 are Action games that plays like a Horror game.

People usually dislike the 6th, I think it's a totally fine game in its own : at least the controls feels in line with what the game is trying to achieve (Combat / Action). In RE4, the game plays like a Survival Horror (with heavy and clumsy controls) while trying REALLY HARD to be a 3rd Person pure action game.

In 2025, RE4R feels SO CLUMSY, SO outdated when it comes to that it hurts. Took me at least 2 hours to get used to the controls. 

Still, RE4R is a very enjoyable game, very close to the original, so you'll be happy to revisit this spanish swamp if you loved it when you were young... or discovering it if you missed it.

Everything about it hooks you: the sound, graphics, and story. Even on standard, it's a solid challenge that tests your resource management. Leon and especially Ada Wong's character models are phenomenal, a big step up from RE2 and the OG RE4

The Separate Ways DLC is fantastic playing as Ada truly completes Leon's story and feels like a main game in itself. It's essential for anyone wanting to see the full picture, and its ending just makes you want more RE!

Ну ok думаю я - проебал стелс, по новой пробую и так и сяк - всегда сука одно и то-же - все агрятся и меня убивают.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199573914,"This remake does a lot of things well : 
+ Makes the story more coherent (with some mishaps).
+ Makes some characters much better (Ashley/Luis).
+ Changes the original game enough for veteran players to be invested and enjoy going through the new, or redesigned areas.
+ Does a mostly excellent job at modernizing the most antiquated parts of the original (shortcuts for weapons, making the different parasites more interesting gameplay-wise, removing most of the annoying QTEs).
+ Some story beats and character interactions, especially between Leon and Ashley, are a vast improvement.
+ Adds a few interesting gameplay mechanics (parry mostly).
+ Is a good-looking game.
+ Pretty much every boss fight is better.
+ Some voice actors do a marvelous job (Ashely, Luis), some do a pretty good job (Leon, Mike, Salazar, Saddler in boss mode).

But if you enjoyed the original game in the higher difficulties, I think you'll rapidly identify the massive downgrades and downright incomprehensible gameplay design choices the devs made. I finished the game in Hardcore after around 20 hours of playtime, and I'm burned out: I'm not even sure I'll make a Professional run. I'll try to identify the issues:
- The shooting feels terrible. Instead of the good old laser pointer, you mostly get crosshairs in the game, that grow wider when Leon moves as he aims, but also when you simply move the mouse around when aiming, meaning you have to stay entirely still to get them to focus. This is entirely inexplicable, and causes a good amount of shots to whiff because of RNG.
- Leon moves like a tank. I kinda understand that with the modern, shoot-and-move style they adopted in this remake, they couldn't make him too fast. However, he's extremely slow and feels clumsy, which is massively frustrating when you want him to get out of the way. Each time he gets hit, he stumbles around forever, leading you to often get hit from another source after recovering.
- Enemies don't consistently stagger. In original RE4, when you shot an enemy in the head (or leg), it triggered a stagger that allowed you to melee him. Now, in the original, this was extremely reliable, and, true enough, could make the gameplay a little stale after a while (headshot-melee-repeat). I don't mind the decision to make it harder to trigger the melee-able state of enemies, but the way the remake took to do so seems to be RNG, especially on higher difficulties. I've often found myself headshotting a guy repeatedly, waiting for him to stagger, and he just ate three handgun bullets to the face without even wincing. Worse, it appeared to me that even light stumbling (enemy getting stopped in his tracks when taking a shot) followed the same principle. That makes the game extremely frustrating: for instance, some enemies that can kill you with one attack are sometimes staggered by shotgun headshots (allowing you to melee them), sometimes simply stumble (giving you the option to run away), and sometimes... just keep moving or attacking as if nothing happened.
- The ammo economy feels terrible. The game showers you with handgun ammunition, and introduces an utterly crappy crafting system that replaces the natural flow of various types of ammunition being granted by the game. In the end (at least on Hardcore), you'll find yourself using your handgun 70% of the time, constantly annoyed by its unreliable nature when trying to stagger or stumble enemies.
- The game offers you ways to parry (with the knife key) or dodge (with the crouch key) certain attacks. However, the option to do so only appears on the bottom right of your HUD, with a very little, unremarkable pop-up, leaving you in the dark about how you're supposed to survive one attack. For instance, if a villager comes at you with an axe, should you parry (knife key) or dodge (crouch key)? You won't be able to glimpse at the tooltip, and end up trying one key or the other randomly. Are you supposed to learn every attack's counter by heart? It makes no sense, especially since the tooltip for the staggered state allowing you to perform a melee attack on enemies is huge, appears on the enemy from a long distance, and even tells you which button (melee move, or knife stab) you're supposed to use.
- The AI is stuck in a weird limbo: it's mostly more aggressive and in-your-face, while keeping the goofy ""standing around and waiting for my turn to attack"" that this kind of game requires to prevent the player from getting stun-locked or combo-ed into oblivion. However, I ended up getting stun-locked and combo-ed into oblivion much more frequently than in the original game, where it happened rarely. Ashley is also much more frustrating, as you can't tell her to wait somewhere, a clear downgrade from the original.

=> These are my main issues with the gameplay. It's a typical case of blatant disregard for the good old: ""if it works, don't mess with it"". Ammo economy was fine in the original game. Laser pointer aiming was fine. Stagger and stumbling were fine, and the melee option being reliably offered to the player was fine too. The feeling of consistency when your actions produced the expected results, depending on the choices you made, were fine. Now granted, the remake did grant the player with some new options that allowed Leon to be much stronger, mainly: better maniability (although moving him around feels terrible) and the ability to move and shoot or reload, knife parries, dodges. Balancing the game around that was possible, by making the enemies more numerous, aggressive and accurate, or even by making them tankier and making melee attacks deal less damage to them. The devs decided to do some of that (making the enemies more aggressive), but in the same move, they also opted to introduce RNG mechanics robbing you of your sense of agency when trying to make enemies stumble, to have Leon stumble endlessly when hit, or to make the player shoot inaccurately because of unavoidable RNG, while making every ammo type but the handgun's a rarety. 
In the original RE4, I remember making a run with only the knife and the unupgraded basic handgun in Professional. I wouldn't even consider it with this game, because the gameplay isn't fun, which is why I don't recommend it.
EDIT : With mods, the game is much more enjoyable, as you can easily get ones to incorporate the original RE4 stagger mechanics into the remake, and fix most of the aiming issues. I'm still not recommending the remake because mods are supposed to increase your enjoyment of a game, not fix bad design decisions.

Now, I'll end up with other negative points that are less overwhelming:
- They tried to make the story more grounded and less cheesy. This works sometimes, but is mostly a vain endeavour because the basis and the main beats of the story are ludicrous. In the end, the game feels uncertain about its tone. 
- The script is downright terrible and uninspired for some characters (Ada, Bitores Mendez, Saddler in human form, Krauser). 
- Some voice actors do an unremarkable, boring job (Saddler in regular form, Hunnigan), some do a bad job (Krauser, Bitores Mendez), some do an immersion-breaking, atrocious job (Ada). 
- The merchant won't shut up.
- The bolt thrower is a boring, terrible weapon.
- The difficulty is somewhat inconsistent. 
- Some sceneries are uninspired and generic (edgy ""blood and animal sacrifices everywhere""), they don't recapture the feeling of the original (some parts of the village, mostly).
- Some puzzles (actually, a couple of the same design) are utter time-wasting trash.
- Some fun content from the original game was cut.
- Maybe a nitpick, but Leon's stances are just much less cool than in the original game. For instance, in RE4, Leon held his handgun up high, always ready to draw and shoot. Now, after running for a tiny bit, he adopts a limp-wristed state that just feels odd.
- Can't turn on the flashlight outside of scripted parts.",False,9,3852

Capcom has done it again. This remake is not just a fresh coat of paint — it's a full-blown reinvention of one of the greatest survival horror games of all time. 🎮

✅ What I Loved:

🌲 Gorgeous visuals that bring every eerie village and creepy castle to life.

🔫 Satisfying combat with tight gunplay and brutal knife mechanics.

🧠 Smarter enemy AI that keeps you on your toes.

😱 Atmosphere is thick with tension — it's scary and stylish.

🧍‍♂️ Leon is still the cool one-liner machine we love (with better hair).

👩‍🦰 Ashley is actually helpful and way less annoying this time.

❗ Minor Gripes:

🧩 A few puzzles felt simplified.

⏳ Occasional pacing dips in late-game areas.

🤑 Where’s my merchant’s discount? ""What are ya buyin’?"" never gets old.

💥 Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the franchise, this remake is absolutely worth it. It's respectful of the original while boldly modernizing it in all the right ways.

The parry system is an excellent addition, the game's story is largely improved with standout moments and characters like Luis, whilst keeping much of the original's lovable campiness in tact. 

My one big issue is the enemy AI on Hardcore+ difficulties. It took a lot of adjustment to get used to the fact that headshots no longer instantly stagger an enemy, which made combat feel clunkier and less refined than it did in the original.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199352417,"I haven't made it too far yet, but I'm having a great time. I still think the RE2 remake is my favourite, but I can definitely see why this game (and the original) have such a strong following. It's definitely not what I would call ""survival horror"", since it is way more action packed and you collect ammo constantly, but as far as ""action"" horror or ""panic"" horror go it certainly ticks all the boxes. You have to manage the enemies and your surroundings carefully, or you can easily get overwhelmed. Leon is a tough dude but even with his action movie hero levels of toughness, taking axe wounds to the shoulder and still firing off an entire clip afterwards, you will die a few times if you haven't played before. Or at least I did.

The game might seem a bit laughable at first if you came from the other remakes, particularly RE2. Where in that game it made sense that you would find some 10mm ammo laying around, since you start in a police station, here you have to suspend your disbelief a bit as you collect seemingly endless amounts of bullets and gunpowder from farm houses and pensioners with pitchforks. And that also takes you back at first, charging around with your custom handgun blowing the heads off old women, rather than carefully navigating eerie corridors and trying to avoid attention from gross looking zombies.

But honestly, it doesn't matter, because this is a totally different type of game and it does it so well. I am only in the third chapter and I am having so much fun with it. Fighting off chainsaw dudes, a chunky boy with a cow head, gangs of crippled old women coming at me like I just cancelled bingo night. Of course it's ridiculous, but then this is a world where zombie monsters took over an entire city and the government decided to blow it off the face of the planet.... it seems sort of natural that the series went in this direction. If you played RE3 then you can easily see the transition, especially by the end of that game.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199324526,"I still own my old copy of Resident Evil 4 on Gamecube. I remember really enjoying the game and finishing it. It's been a long time, so when I saw RE4 remake on sale, I knew I had to pick it up.

This game is as good as I remember. The zones are dark and atmospheric and some areas genuinely distilled a sense of dread in me. The sound design is phenomenal. Cows moan, crows caw and the trees blowing in the wind rustle in the background. There is a great ambience to make the world feel real and threatening. The Las Plaga enemies are a great addition to the game. Headshots are not always rewarding as tentacled horrors emerge from decapitated enemies. Later enemies like the Regenerators slither and slide along the ground in an unnerving, unnatural way.

 Leon is a great leading man. Cool, calm, collected and when his arsenal is built up, he feels like a juggernaut. Men want to be Leon. Women want to be with him. Happy to hear he'll be back for RE9.

This game is highly recommended. The only downside to RE4 is the fact the Ada Wong missions that explain more about her motivations are a seperate purchase. I will get it. I want more RE4. I want to see more of the story and how it connects to RE5. It's just a shame it's not included with the base game.",True,0,1729

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199310252,"Resident Evil 4 is not just a game to me. It is a piece of my soul. It is the heartbeat of my gaming identity. It is the moment my relationship with video games changed forever. Before Resident Evil 4, I played games for fun, for distraction, for a way to kill time. But after it, I realized games could be so much more. They could be transformative. They could be unforgettable. They could touch something deep inside you that you didn’t even know was there.

The first time I launched the game, I wasn’t expecting much. I had heard it was good, sure, but nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to experience. That opening village encounter hit like a freight train. I remember standing there, controller in hand, heart racing, surrounded by enemies closing in, and thinking to myself, “This is not just a game. This is survival. This is war. This is art.” The fear was real. The panic was real. The desperation was real. And somehow, in the middle of all that chaos, I felt more alive than I had in months.

I became obsessed. Every corner I turned, every building I entered, every enemy I encountered added to the story I was building in my mind and in my heart. I was not just watching Leon Kennedy. I was with him. I was him. His journey became mine. His pain, his determination, his strength, his struggle, I felt it all. It was not just about rescuing Ashley or taking down Los Illuminados. It was about pushing forward no matter how bad things got. It was about holding on to hope in the face of absolute madness. It was about never giving up, even when the whole world wanted you dead.

The gameplay was revolutionary, but it was more than just mechanics. The way it made me feel in control, the weight of every bullet, the decision to fight or flee, the risk of reloading mid-combat, the satisfaction of a perfectly timed grenade, it all built this beautiful tension that never let go. And that inventory system. I loved managing my attache case like it was a puzzle within a puzzle. Organizing weapons and healing items wasn’t a chore. It was a ritual. A preparation for the unknown horrors that always lurked ahead.

The world of Resident Evil 4 felt so rich, so detailed, so alive in the most horrifying way possible. The fog-covered village, the grotesque castle, the cold and unforgiving island, each area had its own personality, its own mood, its own nightmares. The game never let me rest. Every time I thought I was safe, it threw something else at me. A chainsaw-wielding maniac. A room full of cultists. A regenerador breathing just around the corner. I was always on edge. But I wanted to be. I craved that feeling. Because that’s what the game does. It makes you feel like you are constantly dancing on the edge of disaster, and somehow that dance becomes a thrill you never want to end.

And then there’s Leon. Leon S. Kennedy became a symbol for me. Not just because he was cool or funny or badass. But because he was resilient. No matter what was thrown at him, he stood tall. He pushed through. He made hard decisions. He never gave up. In some strange way, he became a source of strength for me in my own life. Whenever I was dealing with something tough, I would remember the way Leon kept going, through hell, through pain, through monsters both literal and metaphorical. And I would think, if he can make it, so can I.

The supporting characters only added to that emotional depth. Luis, with his charm and secrets, left a mark on me that I wasn’t expecting. His sacrifice hurt more than I ever anticipated. Ashley may have frustrated players at times, but I saw her as a symbol of innocence trapped in a world of evil, and protecting her gave me purpose. Even the villains were unforgettable. Salazar, with his twisted arrogance. Krauser, with his personal vendetta. Saddler, with his cult-like manipulation. They weren’t just enemies. They were forces to be reckoned with. They were obstacles I had to overcome not just in the game, but in myself.

And the Merchant. What can I say. “What are ya buyin?” became a phrase etched into gaming history. But to me, it was more than a catchphrase. It was a brief moment of relief. A reminder that amidst the chaos, I had a friend. A strange one, sure, but a constant presence who somehow made me feel safe, even in the darkest parts of the world.

Resident Evil 4 did something few games ever do. It stayed with me. Long after I turned it off. Long after I finished it. Long after I played it again. And again. And again. It’s been years, and I still think about it. I still remember specific encounters. Specific sounds. Specific lines of dialogue. I still dream of those eerie hallways, those desperate boss fights, those close calls that made me jump out of my seat. And I remember how I felt. The intensity. The adrenaline. The triumph. The awe.

This game changed how I view horror. How I view storytelling. How I view perseverance. How I view gaming as a whole. It is not just a masterpiece. It is the masterpiece. The one I hold above all others. The one that reminds me why I fell in love with games in the first place. The one that reminds me who I am.

Resident Evil 4 is more than a classic. It is more than a survival horror benchmark. It is a legend. And for me, it is sacred.

If I could relive the experience of playing it for the first time, I would. A hundred times over. Because in that moment, I wasn’t just playing a game.

I was discovering a part of myself I didn’t know I was missing.

And I will carry that with me for the rest of my life.",True,0,1181

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199291589,"So how would describe this game? Resident evil 4 (original) was a masterpiece for it's time, now this game took that masterpiece and expanded it, giving characters more background and personality. 
One thing people hated about the original was Ashley being pretty much annoying, she is more tolerable in the remake and more helpful, she also now lacks a health bar so a lot less to worry about, if she's knocked down, you just have to help her to her feet now.

Let's talk bosses, very well done, a lot more terrifying than the original, but with del Lago, the Easter egg was toned down, that is my only complaint.

Let cycle back to Ashley again, there is a segment in the original where she must navigate an area and use gas torches to attack enemies, in the remake however, you now use a single lantern and can briefly stun enemies with it, the area is also near enough pitch black making it more difficult and scary.

Ada in this game has got more of a part with Leon, helping him a little more and even shows signs of remorse towards the end of the game.

Leon was perfectly done, they kept the sarcasm and his cocky nature but kept it to a level that didn't seem like he was trying too hard.

The enemies come in many styles and have a more dangerous role in the game, they can now grab the player and hold him in place for other enemies to 1 shot him, but you can still use a knife and melee combat against them.

Quick time events have been toned to combat and not at random cutscenes, I prefer this personally.

The location was impressive, they kept as much of the original location as possible and upgraded it, adding new routes and traps for the player.

The merchant has a great role in the game as he did with the original, but now you cannot shoot him which does make sense as he is essentially part of your alliance, he has all the same weapons from the original but a couple of extras.

Speaking of the merchant, in the original you had to shoot 10 medallions and you'd earn a free gun, while this mechanic is still preset, it is expends into little side quests the merchant gives you, in exchange for spindles, which you can the trade for exclusive items.

All in all, this game was definitely in line for game of the year.",True,0,975

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199275770,"Resident Evil 4 Remake is, without a doubt, a masterful reimagining. It successfully preserves the core essence of the original masterpiece while injecting new life into it with modern graphics and refined gameplay.

Visuals and Atmosphere
The game's visuals have reached new heights, boasting incredible detail. Every dimly lit village, eerie castle, and damp underground area is rendered beautifully, significantly amplifying the game's horror atmosphere. The lighting effects and character models are also impeccable, making the entire game world feel more believable and immersive.

Gameplay Experience
Capcom has optimized the controls in the remake, making aiming and movement much smoother and more fluid. Modernized Quick Time Events (QTEs) also make combat more intense and thrilling. The classic melee attacks and knife parry mechanics from the original have been retained and enhanced, adding more strategic depth to combat encounters. Resource management remains a core element, with every decision about ammo and herbs testing the player's wisdom.

Story and Characters
The story largely stays true to the original, with Leon's search for the President's daughter, Ashley, remaining as gripping as ever. While some minor tweaks have been made to the plot, the overall pacing is tighter, and character development feels more nuanced. The return of classic characters, in particular, will be a welcome sight for long-time fans.

Minor Gripes
Despite the remake's outstanding performance, there are a couple of minor points. For instance, some areas can feel a bit repetitive, and the later stages of the game might tire some players out. Additionally, for players seeking a purely horror-driven experience, the remake might feel slightly less terrifying in certain aspects, leaning more towards action-shooter mechanics.

Final Verdict
All in all, Resident Evil 4 Remake is a must-play. Whether you're a long-time fan of the series or new to the world of Resident Evil, you're guaranteed to have a top-tier survival horror experience. It's not just a successful remake; it's a brilliant game that will immerse you in a thrilling adventure. Highly recommended!",True,0,2586

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199208856,"Resident Evil 4 has always been my favorite game in the series thanks to its atmosphere and gameplay, so I’m really glad that the remake did not disappoint me.

Resident Evil 4 Remake truly impressed me with its tense atmosphere and action-packed gameplay. The graphics are stunning and do a fantastic job of enhancing the game’s dark, oppressive atmosphere. The lighting especially adds to the tension, making the experience even more immersive. When it comes to action, I’ve always loved the pacing of Resident Evil games, and this remake is no exception. The addition of the parry mechanic with the knife is a brilliant change—it’s useful, satisfying to use, and became something I relied on constantly throughout my playthrough.

One of the most intense moments for me was the iconic village sequence. From the second you enter the village, everyone comes after you, and you have no idea how long you need to survive or where to go as you scramble around trying to stay alive. The endless waves of enemies created a constant sense of panic, and those moments were both terrifying and incredibly exciting for me.

However, there were a few aspects of the game that didn’t work for me. In the last three chapters, especially on the island and in the laboratory sections, the difficulty felt unnecessarily ramped up. Enemies that just wouldn’t die and endless enemy waves, along with the Regenerador appearing in random places seemingly just to increase difficulty, made parts of the game feel frustrating. There were even moments where I found myself just wanting the game to end. Other than these moments, though, I can confidently say there’s nothing else I found lacking in this game.

Overall, Resident Evil 4 Remake is a highly successful remake with its atmosphere, visuals, and action-packed gameplay. While the unnecessary difficulty spike in the final sections might be a downside for some players, it’s definitely not a reason to skip this game.

Score: 9/10",True,2,1577
Resident Evil 4,2050650,199207560,"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH MAN.

 ALRIGHT I GOT SO MUCH GROUND TO COVER SO HERE WE GO… 
THIS IS NOW MY 2nd Favorite game of all time right behind Cuphead. The gameplay is EXTREMELY ENGAGING, REPLAYABLE AND TENSE (i’ve replayed this game over 3 times already :sob: and i rarely replay games) The story is pretty great and I love how it doesn't take itself seriously!! I love how it keeps on elevating with its craziness every single second. The game is OFTEN PRETTY SCARY especially from its INTENSE gameplay I love what they did with Ashley, how she wasn't an annoying damsel. It was awesome seeing her character develop into a more capable person and she was super funny lol.

Last of all, LEON IS THE GOAT. HE IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROTAGONIST IN A GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED. HE'S BADASS, HE'S HILARIOUS, I LOVE HIM. Only issues I could find with this game is that the final chapters drag a little bit, but they’re still extremely fun. 11/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",True,0,9122

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199191245,"The remakes of the Resident Evil series in this RE game engine are truly amazing. I hope one day that the first can be remade in the same engine and we see 5&6 soon added so I may play them in their best forms. This game is also (of the remakes that I have played) where they go from SURVIVAL horror to ACTION horror. They definitely learned from 3 having a lot cut (I think for S rank you have to beat the game in under 2 HOURS which is crazy) to keeping in the full experience. I had about 16 hours into my FIRST hardcore playthrough and I found it so fun I want to do the new game plus when I finish 7&8. The action part is well done, even if at times I did find some parts annoying, I enjoyed it thoroughly. 

I highly recommend if you play any Resident Evil games however, you should 100% play 2&4. 3 isn't necessarily bad but it doesn't diminish the experience if you skip it and I believe that those 2 are the ones of the remakes that are 100% worth a spot in your steam library.",True,0,1952

It's weird to me that RE4 is the game held up as he gold standard for the franchise meanwhile pretty much all the other ones were all horror leaning.  And what did the lessons from RE4 get us?  5-6 some of the worst.  Also I was lead to believe that the original was really camp and funny and that they toned it down for the remake.  Why?  The stuff in there could be funny but its just sorta not.

The heavy arena style combat kills the horror vibes.  The escort stuff is fine but weirdly intermittent.  Oh and the loot is terrible.

The loot is run by an algorithm and rng based.  While you'll rarely get truly low on anything you need you similarly will never really be given the chance to get ahead.  At one point I had like 8 parts and no gunpowder to make anything with.  Did you want to make a meaningful amount of magnum ammo?  Prepare to wait a million years to do it.

But fine. The REmake team at Capcom is devastatingly effective at its job. The game looks great functions pretty well and other than sandblasting off some of the personality from the original did a good job with this one as it has with the others.

This is hands-down the best Resident Evil game ever made. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",True,1,4217

Resident Evil 4,2050650,199005232,"Trying to chill with my headphones and a dim lamp, but Resident Evil 4 yeets me into a village where everyone’s got a zombie vibe and zero personal space. Leon S. Kennedy’s out here dodging chainsaws like it’s a Tuesday, and I’m muttering, “Mate, I’d hide in a cupboard.” Apparently, my friends think it’s hilarious when I call the ganados “overly enthusiastic party crashers,” but I’m just calling it like I see it.

The gameplay’s smooth, like sorting my snack drawer, and that attache case is my happy place—fitting a shotgun next to my herbs is peak organization. Ashley’s a bit much with her “Leon!” screams, but her corner-crouching game resonates with my soul. The merchant’s chill, though, tossing out guns like he’s handing me a coffee.

It’s spooky, action-packed, and perfect for my solo nights when I’d rather snipe mutants than reply to group chats. My vibe: slay zombies, stay cozy.",True,1,9765

Resident Evil 4,2050650,198985988,"I've been a huge fan of the 2005 version, and replayed it maybe a dozen times.  After putting some time into this version, I can say that I really enjoyed it as a game in its own right and also loved going along and seeing how the remake is different.  At first I wasn't a huge fan of the knife durability and the changed aiming reticle in the remake, but I soon adjusted to them and accepted them as part of the combat system.  The aiming especially seems to be a way to trade off for the increased mobility that you have in the remake, as you can only get max accuracy by standing completely still.  

The atmosphere is great, especially if you're in a dark room with headphones.  Fans of the original RE games may consider this one too easy and action oriented, but the resource management helps provide tension to the action, at least in the first playthrough or in a professional run.   Trying out the different guns is great, as they each have specific characteristics and a unique upgrade.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,198969985,"Resident Evil 4 Remake is everything a remake should be: faithful, modern, and absolutely unforgettable. Capcom somehow managed to improve one of the most iconic games of all time without losing its soul. The visuals are jaw-dropping — environments are darker, more detailed, and dripping with atmosphere. Every village, castle, and lab area feels reimagined with care, yet instantly recognizable to fans. Combat is tighter and more responsive, with smarter enemy AI and satisfying gunplay that rewards accuracy and planning. Knife parries are a game-changer — adding layers of strategy without overcomplicating things. Leon’s character is fleshed out just enough to feel more human, but he still drops just the right amount of one-liners. The new side quests and expanded character moments (like Luis and Ashley) are surprisingly solid additions that feel earned, not forced. Boss fights hit harder, the pacing is excellent, and the soundtrack has been completely revitalized without losing its creepy charm. If you played the original, this remake will blow you away with its respect and polish. If you’re new to RE4 — you’re playing survival horror at its absolute peak. No fluff, no filler, just an expertly crafted experience from start to finish.

Resident Evil 4,2050650,198967615,"If you've played the original, this is still worth the time. 

The maps are tweaked and resized for the better. The placement of events are tweaked to feel more fresh. There's also some completely new events. Enemies are more aggressive and believable. Treasures are reworked to make combining pieces more flexible. There are more weapon types and sub objectives.

The knife has been totally revamped: some will hate that it breaks, but you also do so much more with knives now. It feels like an improvement on Shivs from the original The Last of Us and I'm loving it. There's several quality of life improvements. The game is not just prettier, but new rendering tech has led to improving on an old puzzle (I can't wait to see more of this).

This remake feels like such a unique experience in it's own right. I'll edit this review accordingly if this doesn't hold up for the rest of the experience (only 4+ hours in currently).",True,0,986

Such a video-gamey video game packed with action. The combat is very fun, I had a blast with it and the game looks sooo good. In the dlc, I gasped at Ada's zip-zap grappling gun the first time I saw it in action. The grappling animation is so cool and the feature itself added a lot to the dlc in my opinion, thus making it very fun. Moreover, the fact that you get to pull shields away from enemies as Ada if you wish to use the charm that enables it, is another feature that I enjoyed. The dlc was just as fun as the main game, going through it as Ada was its own kind of special. Impressive. Highly recommend.",True,0,3246

Capcom has done an incredible job of taking a real classic and giving it a new look, without losing the essence of the original. The visuals are sensational, with incredible graphics and lighting that really makes everything darker and more immersive. The forest, the castle, the village - everything is perfect, really. The gameplay has also changed completely for the better: you can now move around while shooting, use the machete more freely. The combats have become more varied, and you can still feel the tension of facing those hordes of Ganados in the same way as always, only now more immersive and fun. The bosses are still striking, and the improvements to the battles have made everything more dynamic, much cooler. The story has been deepened, the characters now have more personality - Ashley is more useful, Luiz appears more, and even Krauser has become more interesting. The pace of the game is perfect, the dialog feels more natural, and the voice acting is sensational. Without a doubt, one of the best remakes ever made.",True,0,1480
