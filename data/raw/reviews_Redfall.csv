Redfall,1294810,209660172,"I went into this hoping for the best, in spite of how negative everything is surrounding [i]Redfall,[/i] but this really is bad. Before I get really negative, the big highlight for me was the backstory for the world. I wished the main/present narrative would have followed the tone of the ""[can't remember the name right now] Echoes"" and all of the notes you find around the world. If they'd gone in a more [i]Dishonored[/i] route and made this with a tone that didn't feel like a sh***y Joss Whedon script, I would have enjoyed the plot too. The antagonists have some pretty good lines and have some of the best performances in the whole game.
But that's it. Those are my only positives.

The gunplay is awful. Swapping weapons takes too long, reloading takes too long (even when you get better versions of those guns, the stats barely change except for the DPS), every shot feels like it is RNG on Damage (shotguns especially), vampires hit you even if you're 10 feet away, you get stuck on nothing or fall through the world randomly, climbing is super bipolar, upgrades are mostly useless except for the community perks, and I could go on. Everything feels stupid janky. I ended up sticking with the same 3 guns in my loadout after killing The Hollow Man. The biggest failing of this game is the absence of matchmaking, just an absolutely moronic decision. After you collect 80/100 Grave Locks, the game starts recycling the first 20 Gateway audio diaries. Why even record so much if you weren't gonna fulfil each one? Why have there be ONE-HUNDRED of these things to begin with? Just to pad out the abysmal runtime?

I hated the protagonists. The same 12 quips over and over, mixed with just terrible abilities (I can say though, I can see how each character's powers would be better in co-op, but I have no friends, so that's just a theory). I wanted to take the main cast seriously but the combination of cringe ""that just happened""/""first-draft"" dialogue and the mediocre performances dragged everything down. I also couldn't take anything seriously due to the crap ""cutscene"" animatics. They felt cheap. I wish the heroes lost.",False,0,1783

After completing the game i have to say the final boss fight was a complete let down, i was expecting more from that fight.

Still loved the game and really disappointing we'll never get a sequel as in its current state it's a really solid and fun game.

Decided to play it again right away with a different character on eclipse from level 1. The beginning feels super hard but after you rack up the community standing it becomes super easy again, bosses are a lot tougher but still beatable as long as you have up to date weapons, last boss once again was a complete disappointment, by far easiest of them all, i disappointed myself hoping for a secret second phase on eclipse but nope. Since some achieves are coop only and i play solo i've given myself them as i complete the story with them, one day i'll come back to the game and do the others but doing 100% runs both times was enough for me for now.

Redfall,1294810,205396894,"Redfall is basically Far Cry 3 but with vampires.

Recently picked it up for $20 on sale on Steam and I wouldnt recommend buying it for anything over that price. I had heard about the awful reviews and bugs and hate, but I have a bit of a love for trashy games.

So I decided to check it out and honestly, it felt like playing an xbox 360 game.

There are

    Open world map with safehouses you need to reclaim and a tonne of collectable items.
    Leveling up/perk system thats very basic
    Loot system that is just the same guns but higher damage and maybe one perk on it that makes it good
    Go to A, kill enemies, basically being the bulk of your missions
    Awkward terrain traversal/platforming

It should be noted though that the game was updated to be playable offline.

By the time I played I didnt get any noticeable bugs or glitches other than the game crashing once when I fast travelled and a collectible item (cosmetics) being stuck at 99% even though i had collected all of them (tbh this one really pissed me off despite being inconsequential, there wasnt even an achievement for 100% collection i just hated seeing it not completed).

Surprisingly decent variety of enemies too, you have your regular humans but there are different factions. Basic thugs, mercenaries and cultists, alongside vampires.

The vampires have special types like the angler that pulls you to them with a hook, or the shroud that obscures your vision by dropping a ring of smoke around you that moves with you so you have to run around until you run into the shroud so you can kill them (they throw ranged attacks at you thankfully so thats how you track them).

Least favourite vampire type was the siphon that basically tethers to you and starts draining your health and only way to break it is to either down him or break line of sight.

This one really fucks you over in open areas but luckily i picked the character that ended up being the most broken (Devinder).

The a.i isnt anything special, they shoot, they flank, they rush, they run, what youd expect from enemy ai but the challenge mostly comes from the vampires bum rushing you at melee range while the humans shoot at you from afar.

The human enemies are oddly deep for being throwaway goons, you can hear them talking to each other and theyll talk about selling out their friends and families to the vampires to survive.

Some feel guilt, others wanted power, others were just using this as a chance to off of someone they didnt like. Even weirder they'll often cry out when you kill their allies, get used to hearing ""that was my friend you asshole!"" when ever you kill someone.

I played on the 2nd hardest difficulty which is midnight, the hardest difficulty is locked behind eclipse which you need to beat the game once to unlock.

Overall there is enough variety of enemies for the game to feel fresh throughout your playthrough, which shouldnt be long.

I essentially 100%'ed the game collecting everything and doing every mission and sidequest and it still only took a little over 20 hours.

I managed to bang this out over a weekend and a friday.

The story is all style and no substance, cool premise but there arent even any animated cutscenes.

The cutscenes are literally just slideshows with someone narrating over them.

There is some cool lore and environmental story telling but the problem is that its all in codexs and journals lying around and i find that the laziest form of story telling.

Even more dissapointing is how dark the game actually is, but it loses its oomph when its all in written text.

For example a family lured another family member back home so they could kill her and use her blood in a ritual to become vampires.

You can even find the body in the basement, despite that because you read it the impact is lessened imo.

Another scene has a soldier torture a nurse begging for her life, where they put her in a kiddie pool and electrocute her until she dies.

But its done in this weird spirit flashback way so alot of the heaviness is lost.

Its this weird tonal whiplash that kinda shocked me at first cos you have Devinder talking about ""what up youtube its ya boi again fighting eldritch horrors and shit, welcome back to innocents massacred monday"" and then they hit you with the above.

Speaking of Devinder, hes basically a streamer who chases after the paranormal.

I had heard alot about the ""millenial"" writing in this game, about how its cringe and very ""hes right behind me, isnt he?"" styled.

But honestly, I didnt really see much of it, granted i only played Dev but he was actually quite morose after the initial opening of the game.

Spoiler alert but basically the vampires became vampires because a girl had special blood that gave people super powers.

The game tries to science it up but its basically magic if were being real.

Doctors come along, convince her to use her blood to help others, realise her power, and bleed her dry and use the blood to turn themselves into vampire gods.

Dev's character arc (what little there is) basically goes from guy whos giddy about discovering real vampires, to guy who wants to avenge this girl who suffered and he becomes much more serious.

Simple but effective, and the voice acting was really good. As for the other characters I dont know, maybe they suck, but Dev was cool.

The setting is real unique, and I really loved the environment, seeing these new england style houses really tickled me for some reason.

unfortunately the game has two maps. Map 1 you kill the first boss. map 2 has 3 bosses.

Why they split this up I do not know but for some reason you CANT GO BACK TO THE FIRST MAP ONCE YOU LEAVE.

It does warn you about this so i did everything before leaving but why even do this?

The loot system sucks ass im gonna be straight up. Basically the same 5 guns except yellow is the best colour and grey is the worst, ground breaking stuff.

Im not gonna lie i put drum and bass music playlist 24/7 on the background and kinda just zoned out playing this, it was kinda like i was in a trance (kinda ironic cos in this game being a vampire is called being under the blood trance).

And i enjoyed it, dont get me wrong this shit is not even close to a masterpiece, hell im even hesitant to say its good, but despite it all, i still had fun in a way.

I can genuinely say I liked playing this, (NOT AS A CO-OP HUGE BUG THE GAME CRASHES ON CO-OP ONCE YOU HIT MAP 2 AND IT NEVER GOT FIXED).

Like if this came out in the state it is now with all the bugs patched and ai fixed in 2012, i could see it being a hit.

Truth be told its just an old game, that just hasnt evolved, but i was feeling nostalgic and thats what this game did.

I wouldnt recommend this game, im not deluded into thinking people would like playing a game that was time capsuled from the early 2010's into 2023 but I think sometimes you run into a game thats emulating the right era and your mind is in the right time frame and it just clicks.

Overall I think the hate RedFall got was justified on release, but as it is now, its a fun quaint little throwback.

Fun little side notes

    . Apparently werewolves exist in this world

    . theres 100 audio file collectibles called grave locks but only 84 recordings made, so for the last 16 they just pick a random audio file youve already discovered and play that

    . the girl whos blood made the vampires spirit arrives at the end as a spirit and thanks you, but shes stuck in limbo untill all vampires die, which is kinda hell when you think about it and also sequel bait

    . the female vampires in this game are so fucking hot i swear to god

    . this would be arkane austins last game before they got shut down

Redfall,1294810,201670532,"I got the game hoping for something closer to Arkane's previous games. Yes I saw the reviews, but I held out hope that the game had since been fixed. While the game is completely playable, it didn't have any of the elements I'd hoped for. It didn't feel immersive. Stealth is hardly an option, but only if you play as Jacob and spec into the tree in a specific way. Combat is hardly better. Enemies' behavior is unintelligent, and their animations often break. Looking for a good story? Find a different game. It could have made for a very story rich game, but it seems they'd spent all their budget on the world creation. That being the only reason I'm leaving a thumbs-up. If you're the type of person who just likes to explore an interesting looking world, this one is one of the most interesting worlds I've seen in a video game. Often gorgeous. But I myself am more interested in the gameplay. Nothing special there. In fact, it often felt clunky to navigate the world due to the detail put into it. I don't know the details of why the game turned out so terribly, but it's a shame what happened anyways.

In conclusion: I recommend only getting the game if you're mostly interested in the ""unique"" world they'd crafted. There's apparently an easy difficulty if that's what you're looking for. The game sometimes goes on sale for 50% off, so I'd wait and get it then.

Story - 
The Good:

The story in this game is fantastic. With each mission you learn about how Redfall came to be a hellhole, and who's responsible for it. A lust for power in a group of people who take advantage of a gift meant to nurture and help others, twisted into a weapon to build themselves up and disposing of anyone who tried to stop them. It's dark, and you get a real feeling of accomplishment as you take down each member of the group. 
You have a hub in both sections of the game; Redfall and Burial Point, with survivors who have their own stories and side missions you can complete. Some of them are bland, but a lot of them are fun, contain interesting story, and they feel real. It's not all sunshine and rainbows, not every mission ends well for the characters. It adds to the immersion and feels fresh compared to other games where the side missions are usually low effort fetch quests.
Now, counter point to what I just said, there are definitely missions that are just fetch quests but they are mostly few and far between.
You can see how this world can bend and even break people, and how others band together to survive. It's something that I feel like a lot of games have really forgotten, that sometimes a good story doesn't HAVE to have a completely happy ending. People break, people die, and it's not always fair.

The Bad:

You know basically nothing going into the game, and if you don't try to pay attention, you can miss a lot. My first run I basically missed the story because it's a lot of drawn out talking. There are cut-scenes in the game, but they are 3-D stills with your character just talking. The mix of slow reveal with slow exposition really drags it down. (Depending on which character you're playing you get different dialogue, that's something I don't think I've seen before and is interesting)
It does feel like the story didn't quite fit a full 15-20 hour game and got stretched out as far as it could. I 100% 'ed the game (All collectibles, all side missions, etc.) so it took longer, but if you were just wanting to play the main story, you could realistically beat this game in about 9-12 hours.

Gameplay- 

The Good:

The 4 characters you can choose from each have their own abilities and skill trees, but the main crux of the game is the guns and staking vampires. The guns feel pretty good to control, and there's plenty of variety for what kind of weapon you want to wield. You can have up to 3 weapons equipped and its completely up to you how you want to run. You want to snipe people? Sniper, Smg, and pistol. Like being up close? Smg, Shotgun, steak launcher. Big fan of explosions? Shotgun, Flaregun, Steak launcher. Etc...

Each character has 2 skills and an ultimate ability. Depending on your playstyle you'll prefer one over the other, but they boil down to:

Sniper
Psychic
Gunner
Stunner

I like the different characters, they each have their own story and reason for being in Redfall in the first place, they aren't just the guy you play, they react to what happens around you. If you play co-op with someone, there is an entire trust system between your characters who talk to each other and joke around.

The Bad: 

This game got 4 major updates before support for it ended and it is still a glitchy and broken mess at times. 
The game stutters a lot, crashes are common (especially after you reach Burial Point), but the main technical issue with this game is that it just has bugs that will now never be fixed.
My first run of this game was Co-op with my husband and it was a 50/50 chance that when I hit PLAY the lobby just wouldn't launch and say error. I was able to fix this by forcing the game to always run in Administrator mode, which also fixed a lot of the stuttering and frame issues I had, but the game should be more optimized than it is.
There doesn't seem to be any one trigger that causes the game to crash, but they happen more often than I'd like. And be careful playing co-op because it seems that bugs and crashes are more likely when playing with others. 

The skill trees feel weak, some perks are insanely great and feel like they shouldn't have been locked behind a skill, and others are completely pointless. You can respec your skill tree at any time, as long as you have 10,000 support to spend (Which you eventually will have LOTS to spend).
The Community Standing board that also unlocks perks for the entire party that feels very similar. Some are great and others are basically nothing, but it costs Support instead of skill points.

Support is this games version of currency, which you get by completing tasks, killing vampires, picking up junk items, and scrapping weapons. In the beginning you'll struggle to gather enough and have to chose between buying more ammo or picking up a new perk. But once you get about 1/4th of the way through the game, you'll just forget you needed it. When my husband and I got to Burial Point we had almost 2 million combined with every community standing perk already bought. It feels like this system is kind of just useless once you reach a certain point.

A key part of this game is the weapon quality system which is a highly debated topic but I have to be honest, it feels out of place. I think if it was just an unlocking system with perks specifically for the types of weapons you had it would be way better. (Example: You start with a pistol and find/unlock new weapons as you continue, you can choose which weapons you want to use, and each weapon has it's own skill tree)
It really does feel like corporate said: ""People like Fortnite, make it like Fortnite.""

Which brings me to...

The External Situation:

I can't confidently say exactly what happened, but it boils down to Microsoft trying to make a AAA MMO game out of what was supposed to be a story driven game. They jacked up the price to 70$ and made the team go in the looter-shooter direction, which is a stark contrast to the other games this team has put out before (Prey, Dishonored, Etc.)
Microsoft put money over players and it shows, but that's not even the part that makes me angry.
After the backlash of the game's release filled with bugs, broken AI, and how the game just is in general with the choices they made, Microsoft decided to just abandon the game, close the studio, fire 96 people, and write it off as a loss. Which is not only just a giant shit in the face of Arkane Austin, who tried their absolute best to bring this game to life, but also feels like a slap in the face to the players as well. 
I really like the story in this game, and I wish we could get more of it, but that will never happen because it was fumbled. And that's the main problem with gaming today, its more about money and less about making something people will enjoy.

Overall, I think this game has more hate than it should. I do think that the current price of $40 is too much, it should be a solid $20 game, especially in it's current state with no future support for it. The initial $70 price was absolutely ridiculous.

But these points should not be against the game itself, it should be against the company that ruined it. Microsoft. It's so sad to see another great IP lost because the company that owns it sucks.

If you can grab this game while it's on sale and have the patience to deal with it's faults it's honestly a great time. My husband and I have been playing it nonstop since we bought it and laughed through the bugs while enjoying the fun of it. I wouldn't recommend buying it full price (I bought a key online and it cost me $10) but I would recommend playing it before they decide to axe the servers forever.

Just run it in offline mode once you get past the bug (can be selected in the options menu) and it'll run just fine with very few game-breaking technical issues.

If you're curious, just don't pay full price. Like, 20 bucks on sale feels right for something this length that was abandoned. Friendly tip though, Devinder is the only character worth playing solo since all of his abilities are obscenely strong and help dealing with the balance issues with certain enemy types due to the abilities' high levels of stun, stagger and damage. He's also got the best traversal tool since it can be thrown through windows to ignore certain puzzles and platforming sequences, and his unique weapon (acquired late game) is also by a wide margin the best of the four.

and b) the fact that there isn't a true 'save game' in this game, and if you mess up one of the achievements, you have to play a whole other character to get to the same spot to try again. This wasn't so bad when I was trying to get an achievement in Act 1, but for the Lost Unit quest in Act 2 I failed TWICE and had to get a THIRD CHARACTER to Act 2 in order to finish it.

Honestly, this game had some rather solid ideas and a promising combination of genres. A big kudos to the writers who fleshed out the world with plenty of lore. The game also ran smoothly, and the combat, for the most part, felt satisfying.

Unfortunately, the game is hampered by too many ""unfinished"" and ""bare minimum"" features that make the overall experience lackluster.

We were unable to finish the game because the co-op on the second map is completely broken. After a certain point, we were met with a permanent loading screen. My friend even rushed to the same point on a new save, and the issue persisted, preventing us from progressing. The only potential workaround might be to complete the entire second map in a single session, but that comes with its own risks.

The game also suffers from quite a few bugs, some of which are game-breaking and force a complete restart. So, if you do attempt a single-session run of the second map, you'll need to hope you don't encounter one of these issues.

While key areas of the world featured some nice designs, the environment suffered from inconsistencies, oddities, and bugs, such as chests spawning inside objects or assets floating and clipping through the terrain.

In conclusion, this game can offer a fun co-op experience if you're willing to overlook its massive amount of unfinished content, unpolished features, and frequent bugs. You'll have to squint even harder to ignore the inconsistent, lifeless world and bland characters.

The best parts of the game were its conceptual gunplay, loot system, and skills. It’s a real shame that the game was seemingly abandoned and the developers let go, leaving it as an unfinished, buggy mess that was rushed to release.

Arkane's signature imsim flare can be seen here and there in the level design, but it's sprinkled about so sparingly that you hardly notice it's even there.

I like the guns and how each pickup looks slightly unique! But other than that, you're probably better off playing something else.

-
Ill get it out of the way first and start with the bad, the story and cinematics are trash. The dialogue has some charm, if you look at them as a cute comic lines. But you wont get anything seriously good here narratively. Character designs look so dumb, the overly cartoon character models is just giving ""Fortnite"" and feels off putting for a game like this. Performance isnt the best, on a RTX 4080 im still seeing mediocre Framerate on Ultra at 1080p.
-
Now as far as everything else i think the game does really well. UI design is amazing, i think to this day is still some of the best UI i've seen in a game. Its clean, nicely animated and aesthetically pleasing. Matching the Vampire tone while still looking really modern. 
-
Gun play is great. I will say at first, the gun handling felt very amateur. HOWEVER the moment i got that first blue pistol with increased accuracy and fire rate, then turned ON aim assist... yes for mouse and yes it does feel nice lol. The gun play then started feeling great. 
-
The progression from the the skill tree and community trees are awesome. It keeps me wanting to play more and makes me want to interact with side content and explore the area. This is a good loop to keep me going back to those safe houses and progressing my characters power.
-
Exploration and level design in this game are just utterly amazing i always get that feeling ""Oh i wonder whats over there."" that feeling is really nice in an open world game. Where in many other open world games you just tend to book it to the objective. The verticality is great too you can climb many things. Lots of side activities and interesting locations like mansions, beat up towns, out cast forests, to seaside docks. It all feels so fresh.
-
Another positive is the game will sporadically have horror moments, in caves, even in houses and random spots. Playing late at night i did get a little spooked, as the game began to build tension on me. Thats the exact feeling i want in a Vampire game. 
-
Another underrated aspect the sound and music is all really great here, building suspense or getting you pumped for fights or even re-spawning at a safe house, while the music rejuvenates you to go out just one more time it all just sounds really cool.
-
Now its not game of the year or anything, but for what it is a looter shooter in a vampire word, set in a lush foresty dark Massachusetts... Everything i personally enjoy in setting and tone. Its amazing, ill likely continue all the way to the end im curious to see where things go and the progression is doing enough to keep me invested. I certainly think this game is a must play if you can find it for under $20.

 The level design is pretty great, the Locations felt well thought out and usually more than just being a set piece to kill some vampires in

There's a couple missions that show what the game could have been, but there's so many avenues the game could have gone that would have made it fundamentally more enjoyable

Any semblance of spookiness, or dare I say horror is gone when you add legit heroes to the mix, at least for me.
I enjoy the characters and their personality, but why should someone with supernatural abilities and a vampire ex-boyfriend be scared of the current setting? Or a supernatural phenomen hunter?

The levels themselves can actually build some atmosphere, and creeping around corridors with your flashlight, with some silhouettes hushing around or humanoid figures casting shadows in your field of view feels honestly great. Add in the constant droning of cult leader speeches and you can get decently immersed in the game.
I also enjoyed the constant mistery behind the vampire outbreak, every new piece of information just opened up more questions behind the key figures and their motivations.

Once the action starts though the game kinda falls apart. You use your different arrays of abilites and blast through vampires. The different ""elite"" vampire types are nice to have in the game, but are, at best, annoying to fight against.  The different character abilities are decent fun, but event the most fun abilities and interactions can't make unfun enemies fun to fight against.
A slower paced, more grounded approach to combat would have helped here in my opinion.

Enemy AI is pretty basic, humanoid enemies stay in cover usually, vampires just bolt straight at you.

The weapons are fun to use, and while there is some variety to them, when a massive part of your game is the potential loot grind you need wayyyy more options to choose from. The aiming with mouse also never felt quite right, and more weapon customization would have been welcome. Let me fit a suppressor on weapons and switch scopes

I had to do a couple things to get it running right but it didn't take long. The first thing I had to do was to try and figure out why it kept crashing, twice in 45 minutes, and luckily someone in the forums discovered that turning off upscaling fixed the crashing and so far it has worked. I had to experiment a little bit with vsync. In-game vsync sucks, so I had to disable it, set frames to unlimited, and set vsync in the nvidia control panel to 'fast'. Setting it to just 'on' gives you bad input lag in the game so I found that setting it to 'fast' fixed it. I tried nvidia reflex but it makes the game run like crap so I turned it off.

It's an Ok game. 

Animations are a bit janky, it has some bugs with the animations, they skipped doing the cutscenes in motion and are done with 3D models standing still in poses while your character narrates something.

The graphics are ok, heavily stylized like previous Arkane titles but its a bit more demanding while not looking much better, and getting minor stuttering (nothing major like some modern games)

The loot is a bit poor, it feels like the loot pool is really small with a really small legendary variety. And the gameplay loop feels a bit repetitive by the time you are finishing, the side content from the safe houses is repeating the same 2-3 types of missions then a boss, while the secondary quests from the Hubs are more unique there are way less of them.

Overall the game feels like it was rushed out of the gate, and they suffered for it sadly, the story on itself wasn't bad, characters were ok, and the setting was interesting, but i can only recommend the game if you grab it on a sale with a steep discount if you want to play a shorter looter shooter solo or with a buddy (i played solo i can't say anything about co-op)",True,15,1904

Redfall,1294810,191618815,"Redfall – A Second Chance Worth Taking

I recently reinstalled Redfall after shelving it shortly after launch, and honestly? I’m impressed. This game had a rough start—no denying that. At release, it was plagued with performance issues, lackluster AI, and just felt unfinished. Like many, I dropped it with a sense of disappointment. But curiosity got the better of me, and after hearing about a string of updates, I gave it another shot.

I’m glad I did.

After diving back in, I spent around four hours exploring the vampire-infested world of Redfall, both solo and in online co-op with friends—and I can confidently say the experience is so much smoother now. The combat feels sharp and responsive, movement is fluid, and best of all, I didn’t encounter a single crash or noticeable bug. Lag? Gone. Enemies? Actually engaging. The improvements are real.

There’s a strange satisfaction in clearing out vampire nests or teaming up to take down cultist strongholds. The atmosphere is still there—creepy yet oddly beautiful in its own way—and with the technical issues ironed out, it finally feels immersive. The servers are also still very much alive, which was a pleasant surprise, especially when jumping into co-op with minimal matchmaking issues.

Do I wish this was the version of Redfall we got at launch? Absolutely. But sometimes games need time to become what they were meant to be. It’s clear the dev team has been working hard behind the scenes to get this title into fighting shape.

If you were burned at launch, I get it—but if you still have it in your library or you’re on the fence about trying it, now might be the time to give it a second look. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely playable—and more importantly, fun.",True,6,1551

Redfall,1294810,191303610,"Played solo as Jacob – after the final patch.

Far from the most terrible game ever made, Redfall is a bog-standard, by-the-numbers looter-shooter. Too easy and not scary. PC performance is fixed though. 
5/10
Total size on my ssd: 71.8 GB

+ Performance is fixed. Redfall ran smooth and stutter-free for me (5950X +4070 Ti Super)
+ Sandbox design is great.
+ The stylized graphics are generally good. Can be degraded by excessive default brightness levels, so check that out when starting. There is a flashlight tool available throughout the game, so don’t hesitate to make things dark and use the flashlight! When you do…
+ ...The atmosphere starts to click. Darkness everywhere at night, random streetlights casting pools of light in the darkness. Even during the daytime, exploring a shed or basement will need the flashlight.

+/- enemy design is decent, but there isn’t enough variety. Barely half a dozen different vampires. The rest are human cultists or hostile mercenaries.
+/- Have seen freeze-frame cutscenes before in DLC (Just Cause 3), but they’re odd in a full game. Definitely feels like a cost-cutting measure.
+/- Story is actually decent, but feels rushed and patchy, being told through freeze-frame cutscenes w/ voiceover, collectibles, and impersonal holographs. 
+/- gameplay tries to emulate DOOM. It feels quick and slick, but movement feels a like you’re on ice-skates. Mantling / climbing works fine, but feels cumbersome in the middle of a firefight.
+/- ambient music is generally good, though there are a few odd mood choices

- First area, Redfall Commons, has a single major boss, while the second area, Burial Point, has three. Like there were plans for a larger game, but the vision for the game had to be scaled down so they jammed everything into Burial Point.
- character back-story is never explained. Jacob, for instance, has some history with one of the villains, but it’s only referenced in passing. There aren’t any collectibles which expand on it, either.
- can’t return to the first area, Redfall Commons, after leaving it
- level design is still too linear. Those times where Redfall took me out of the sandbox and into a dedicated level, the level is still a very direct path from beginning to end. 
- Too easy. You take a lot of damage, so face-tanking is out, but you also deal tons of damage. If you keep your weapons on-level and are smart with the use of cover, combat will never make you sweat.
- Not scary. Redfall’s biggest mis-step. Vampires scream, swagger and laugh, but I never felt in danger.
- Not Gothic enough. There’s a presumption that vampires = swirling cloaks, evil laughter and imposing castles with intricate spires / gargoyles and (inside) luxurious red velvet everywhere. The swirling cloaks and evil laughter are in Redfall aplenty, but the modern-day setting just didn’t work for me.
- Vram-hungry. Played at 3440x1440, max settings, and vram usage was regularly over 12GB (dedicated; allocated was even higher). I suspect some of the people complaining about stutter simply didn’t have enough vram.


Redfall is worth picking up if you can get it cheap. I had some fun clearing the map of collectibles, I didn’t hate the gameplay and it has some decent atmosphere. 100%-ing the game will require co-op; good luck finding people to play with, as the online is deserted.",True,4,1989

I honestly think your view of this game will depend on how much you paid and what you're expecting. If you paid full price and expected a AAA game, as most folks did at launch, you will definitely be disappointed. It does not feel like something on the level of a Bethesda or other AAA game. That said, I paid about $7, so my expectations were much lower Now, there's still TONS of stuff wrong with the game. It crashed a number of times during my playthrough. I also hit a glitch with a boss where I couldn't deliver the killing blow (which other people have had too) and had to completely redo the boss fight. There's in-game glitches and just lazy game development stuff too, like that you still hear the random lines from bosses *after* you've killed them, instructional prompts at nests come up *every single time*, and instructions don't actually pause the game and involve a long button press to get to go away (which resulted in me dying more than once). The ""cut scenes"" were often pretty lame, as well. In addition, the difficultly leveling can be WAY too. As in, I had more trouble with the first boss than I did with the final boss of the game, who I managed to kill first try without even getting close to dying.

Was initially excited when Redfall launched on XBox Game Pass in 2023 just because the title seemed different and I enjoy survival horror games, but quickly lost interest given how buggy it was.  2 years later I got a cheap game license for PC from one of those internet game license sites and figured, I'd try it again.  

I've played on all the difficulty levels from easiest to hardest.  However, I've only ever played as Jacob because, well, sniping.  So can't comment on any of the other characters.

The game is fun, at least I think so or I'd not have logged a zillion hours into it.  I enjoy the creepy horror aspect, which was certainly very excited on the first run-through when you don't really know what's coming next.  The story isn't bad.  It's a novel take on material that's presented countless (hah?) times in the past, but Arkane has a good backstory that isn't just the same 'ol.   So playing through the single player story line the first time was fun.

The game is not particularly hard, even on the hardest difficulty.  When you start out and you have no skills and no decent weapons, you need to proceed more carefully and slowly.  But once you have some abilities and better weapons, thing start to roll along.   I actually wish the hardest mode were harder to present more of a challenge.   

Unreal 5 engine looks great.  Town is rendered nicely.  Many of the buildings have doors or windows you can use to enter said buildings and look for lot or plot items. 

There are still some bugs.  For instance, it's possible to get stuck while crouched/creeping around.  It happens occasionally in Redfall Commons and a LOT in Burial Point, which leads me to believe the dev team spent more time polishing RC and was rushed to make their release date before BP had been as thoroughly debugged.  Normally, if you get stuck and you're not in combat you can use the map to fast travel someplace else and then go back to the area where you were stuck.   The only time I got stuck where this presented a problem was when it happened inside one of the vampire nests after I'd cleaned it out and was destroying the tethered heart connections.  In that case I had to do the nest over again.

Other stupid glitchy stuff is Jacob saying dumb things like, ""Got the last one"" when there are more monsters/NPCs heading your way to attack you.  Happens all the time.   That and saying, ""There's a nest nearby"" EVERY TIME you enter the area that a nest influences, as if you wouldn't already know this on account of the nest barrier and visual effects within.

At this point I've played through at least 5 times and probably explored 90% of the buildings and map area, though I would guess there may still be some buildings that can be entered that I haven't noticed yet.   It's disappointing that the Arkane Studio team was disbanded because it seems clear they were planning some DLC for this with at least a final vampire boss based on a missing NPC and some implied comments by other NPCs.   Besides introducing a final, harder boss, I would have liked to see more variety in the regular and special vampires including different looks/models, more abilities, different combinations of abilities, and possibly even more unique abilities for named vampires.   Once you figure out what various vampires are capable of, they're a lot easier to fight and kill, so adding some variation and surprises would add some scare factor back.

On my last two run-throughs I decided to use the flare gun exclusively.   It may not be immediately apparent, but based on how the devs created this weapon it is arguably the most versatile in the game.  The only downside is that there really isn't enough flare gun ammo around, so I cheated and enabled unlimited ammo.   Ok, and when the Rook appears I did use two other weapons that are better suited to dispatching him.  And the vampire bosses.  Yes, I suppose I could kill the Rook and the bosses with the flare gun if I had to, but it would take a long time and frankly it's not fun and not worth it)  But killing everything with the flare gun?  That's actually a hell of a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.",True,2,31904

I went into Redfall hoping for at least a decent co-op shooter, but what I got instead was one of the most shockingly bad AAA releases in recent years. This game is an absolute disaster on almost every level, and the negative reviews are 100% deserved.

The control doesn't feel great a t all, the movement feels stiff and floaty. It just neve feels satisfying to play. 

The plot had potential, but it was executed terribly. Vampires taking over a town sounds pretty cool imo! But the way we were presented with the story is laughably bad. The story is completely forgettable, and by the time you get through the missions, you won’t care about anything that’s happening.

Another thing is, there are no proper cutscenes! Instead all we get are [b]PowerPoint slides[/b]. Seriously a really baffling choice. Instead of actual cutscenes, Redfall presents its major story moments through still images with no animation whatsoever. Imagine paying full price for a game these days, only to get something that looks like a slideshow instead of a cinematic experience. It feels lazy and completely kills any sense of immersion.

For a game released at AAA pricing, Redfall gives you the bare minimum of effort. This game simply not worth your time or money.

Key takeaways: in some ways it reminds me of Cyberpunk at launch. You can tell that there's a good (potentially great) game hidden in there somewhere, but the game never truly realizes its potential.

Where CDPR recovered fully, Bethesda/Arcane really shit the bed. This needed *at least* 6-12 more months in the oven. Had it been given that, I really do think it could have been a solid 7-8. Even after about a year's worth of updates, I'd say Redfall hit somewhere between a 5-6 for me.

The atmosphere is pretty cool, and I can appreciate the general aesthetic, but the world still feels very empty and ""same-y"". There are points of interest scattered throughout the world, but none that made be think ""wow, that's cool!"". There are scraps of story bits strewn in, but it's mostly just weapon finds.

If that's your thing, you can find yourself in a mindless flow state fairly easily, and it could be worth a purchase (in the $20 range at least).

The story really fell flat -- at no point did it ever have its hooks in me. The AI isn't the worst, but it's a far cry from being good.

Redfall,1294810,182664526,"I'll be reviewing the game as a 7$ game instead of a 70$ dollar one because you can find Redfall in a bundle on Fanatical for around that price.

The technical state:
After the patches the game is in what I call a good enough state where you can have fun and are able to ignore all the glaring issues.
The game plays really well, though disable Framegen if you are experiencing issues, not only will fix this the horrible input latency but it will also fix the crashes (at least for me).
It runs smooth without frame generation though keep in mind I got a 5700X3D and a 4080 Super.

The positives:
+ Gameplay wise Redfall is a ton of fun, it looked fun back when it got released though the all the issues it had for 70$ is daylight robbery so I gave it a hard pass like everyone else.
+ The game has a meme status for the crap AI, the hilariously easy difficulty and bugs galore. This has now been largely addressed to the point where it can actually be quite challenging on the highest available difficulty, especially at the start. The vampires are quick, unpredictable and have AI similar now to that of Bethesda games, so not great but not bad either.
+ The gunplay is a ton of fun and pretty smooth! The movement is a little bit jank and could've used some more dev time. Still I prefer the gameplay of Redfall over something like Borderlands 3 or Dying Light 2, it's a perfect game to mess around in and have fun.
+ The world of Redfall (the first map) is really quite nice to explore, lots of unique looking places to look through and it can seriously look pretty dang good at times.
+ The loot is a little like that of Borderlands 1, simple, little variation between guns but still fun to loot.

The big negatives:
- The second map sucks, boring generic looking environments, few unique looking locations and just not as fun to explore. This was clearly developed to extend the playtime of the game because it feels so half-assed.
- Sometimes the AI still craps out, especially if you run around cover they can easily be cheesed.
- The story, dialogue sequences and characters are terrible. No depth, simple as can be and all consist of fetch-type quests. Even the main quests offer the same amount of depth, if you're after a story to care about look elsewhere.
- Short playtime considering the price on release.
- Simple and unoriginal mechanics, everything Redfall does has been done before.
- You can still tell that the game has been slapped together to be in a state that it can be sold in, the studio clearly had no idea even near the end what the game was going to be.

Look, the game is enjoyable but not worth more than 10$, I'm someone that can enjoy games that could be considered as a guilty pleasure like We Happy Few and Fable 3, if you're like me and the gameplay looks fun you'll have a good time.

Pretty cool vampire variants.
World evolves with story progress.

Actually good in Co-op. I see how single player could be lacking.

Redfall is missing the cutting edge stealth mechanics of prior Arkane titles but I suspect Co-op connectivity created the need for simplified stealth.
Co-op connectivity has been solid, a major improvement from Deathloop.

A lot of the vampire powers seem fit for gameplay akin to Dishonored but the game opts for a limit of 4 unique powers based on which of the 4 characters you choose.
Powers are okay.. they synergize well in Co-op play but are definitely uninteresting and repetitive in solo play.

For combat, the vampires can get in your face, but the human ai is dumb as nails. They'll run backwards and spend more time staring at your feet than pumping lead into your chest. Also included are explosive cars and electrical boxes, great for collateral damage. Maybe it was just the difficulty but I really didn't feel any danger. I don't think I got any cool loot either, just the occasional upgrade that carried me to the end.

It's made for co-op but idk why they'd lock achievements to just the host. I got to about the halfway point with a friend when we realized this and had to restart solo. Accessibility settings include infinite ammo and I really didn't feel bad putting that on. Also, there's no in-game save system and there are branching decisions. Feel free to manually scum your documents folder.

There are skill trees for each of the four playable characters that seem like skill trees; you level up to get upgrades for your abilities.

Redfall: NO.

It starts off quite fun, vampires are pretty tough (on hardest difficulty, solo) and exploration seems interesting. You establish a base with other survivors who setup shops and have side missions for you. Quickly though you realise the thin-ness of everything. The other survivors talk rubbish, they barely acknowledge you (even though you're saving the world while they sit on their butts), the shops sell junk, the doctor only sells medkits (there's only 1 kind too) and there's only a handful of missions. The survivors missions (I recall like 3?) were just fetch quests. You'll find very little in the world except pointless notes and some items that boost your ultimate meter base level.

Soon you get overwhelmed with the amount of loot, too. So, much, loot. Levelling up feels pretty linear so even in late game you level up quite a lot and those legendary guns you got soon get overpowered by rare or lower quality guns of higher levels. I maxed out both skill trees around the same time I got to the end of the game... or what I thought was the end. But no, another whole new map opened up, this time with 2 ""bosses"" in but otherwise you're doing EXACTLY the same stuff. There's literally no new gameplay elements, no new progression, just more of the same. If they cut the game in half it would've been better for it.

Dumb stuff the game does:

- Puts batteries everywhere. *Everywhere*. Even on top of cars, which seems redundant. When shot they shoot out electricity that does massive damage to everything
- Puts petrol under every car, which does massive damage to everything
- Pointlessly spawns a ""boss"" in when you kill too many vamps which shoots lightning from the sky (Did I mention all the batteries and petrol everywhere that do massive damage?)
- Lets some enemy attacks interrupt you when you're in the canned animation for your special ""ultimate"" attack
- Gives enemies massively annoying abilities like siphoning off your health from a huge distance or dragging you towards them
- Makes you HOLD DOWN the key to use a medkit (which takes ages to apply and does very little)
- Lets vamps immediately spawn behind you 1 second after they see you or you attack them from a mile away
- Moves you to the 2nd map and doesn't let you go back to the first (Stops you getting all the collectibles and you probably won't feel like spending hours getting them all in the ""middle"" of the game)
- Doesn't give you a ""dodge"" button which is one of my pet peeves in an fps, especially when most enemies just run at you and melee

My favourite ""FU"" moment? Spawning out of a safehouse, one of the defensive turrets tried to shoot an enemy and instead shot a car that was parked right in front of it. Did I mention the petrol? Instadeath for me before I could blink. ""Yay"".

Other technical stuff:

- Games runs at high fps but still has lots of traversal stutter (Unreal Engine)
- Cartoony Fortnite style graphics don't match the dark tone
- Forgets your gfx settings so you need to re-apply them every single time you load the game (How is that still an issue after all this time?)
- Crashes quite a lot

Wrap it up:

Game looked like it was on a good trajectory at one point but then they either ran out of time, ideas or money. What's left is ""ok"" but it cost me about a tenner - I wouldn't pay much more for it. Play it while you watch TV or something if you're desperate for some open-world vamp killing action.

Thanks Arkane Austin for the latest patches, hope you guys will fall on your feet.

EDIT:
I'm a big S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan and love Ghost Recon Wildlands above most games, but this one can be played solo exactely how you want it; stealth, gunner, both. I really had some insane situations happening to me, from stupid death after having barely survived and close to my goal, having to run for my life after a situation escalated with some vampires in an abandoned railroad track surrounded by kinda cliffs, so no way around but trapped on a straight line, finally escaping this too much closed area, fleeing through the bushes to cross a main road, attracting various factions to the dance, and survived with a lot of sweat.

In higher difficulties, enemies track you way way longer, that's really a manhunt sometimes; I've just (10 mins ago) been followed from a main road to a dried sea zone pretty far away, and as I felt safe down there by the rocks but decided to lounge them, and I did well because a lot of guys did follow me to the edge of the rocks, but didn't penetrate the dried sea, as 3 vampires were already killing some cultist there.

The thing also is that night is way more dangerous than ""day"" because vampires activity is way higher, almost no sleeping ones or hiding by the environment shadows, they can roam more freely, and altogether with packs of allies (cultists).
So moving at night feels a lot different than by daylight, also a really interesting contrast and change in gameplay. There's actually a lot of subtilities to discover, things have been thought pretty deeply.

What is cool is that there are some interactions within the world between vampires, cultits and another corporation, so when you move forward in the game, the world actually feels more alive as they fight each others, lots of random events...

I started on Dawn difficulty and moved to nightmare just to get feelings back from the very beginning, when you're poorly armed and every single threat is dangerous, and believe me, a lot can happen and it can turn surprising pretty quick.

There's also a lot of verticality, you can access almost all rooftops, there's pretty much always a way to climb up to take advantage of being above things, even if you play Jacob, who can't ""teleport"" himself or throw himself in the air like Devinder .",True,46,170

Redfall,1294810,173023963,"Update after finishing Game :

Please consider that after starting the 4th Journey on Elden Ring with the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC with 1133 hours later , plus another 73 hours on Steel Rising on Epic Games , this is my first Non Souls type / and normal game ( to say the truth it is also refreshing ) so my Review can be biased on how difficult the game is ......

Story/Narrative is Awesome , and voice casting is very good 

Main story Narrative progression is sequential.. By the way on story progression there is no animation , its a 3D comic/anime book style visuals ,with voice acting 
 
If you are going to ask why vampires still appear during daylight etc , don't do it , the important thing is that the game is entertaining

Bosses are NOT that hard - BUT I did NOT try the Eclipse Game Play mode - which is the Hardest ..( there are 4 Main Story Bosses ) , then the Elder Nests Bosses , and some special vampires roaming in particular areas.

To be Honest I played it with unlimited store of ammo ( option when you start game ) , but in reality there was no need as there are a good amount of pick up points in game and even when killing cultists/operators  they drop.

This Game has a lot of looting but no crafting , character upgrades like Vampire God Remnant are earned during story progression and Blood Remnant upgrades are earned with killing particular vampires or by completing  vampires Nests and the Elder Nests in time after destroying main nest hearth,later in game these  can be found also by looting letter boxes ( after buying option in safe house upgrades )  , weapons are found during looting and can even buy these

There is also character progression with usual XP points on killing foes and even from safe houses a different type of upgrade for various items from better looting , reducing damage from 'Rook' lightning by 50% etc etc etc, helping residents and doing safe houses 'side quests' will unlock these , there are an amount of these upgrades to keep you busy

Game is basically a shoot'em'up , it's not so challenging but at the end it is a stress free entertainment , its ideal to cool down after a day at school / work 


INITIAL / Original Review

I bought it recently , on seeing negative comments  , now game is very stable , I like both story and game play itself , its a very good game.

All it needed to be a great game, if it was slightly more populated as there are some areas which are a bit quiet / no action.

You can still feel Arkane's soul in it, the graphics, abilities, weapon. I'd say it matches more Deathloop than Dishonored or Prey.

I played using Devinder as teh Translocate ability felt a bit like the Blink ability is Dishonored.
I really liked the story, it start slow with just a city overrun by vampires, but as you complete the missions and advance through the story you get more infos about what the doctors did and how it came to being vampires.

The difficulty scale is weird, at the easiest setting pretty nothing can touch you, move up 1 notch and the vampires can 1-3 shot you already.

Looking at weapons, you had a wide variety of them, you can't modify the unrivaled tier weapon with the stakes you find which is a bummer. You can't upgrade your weapon, you just have to hope you'll find another one when a few level higher. I played with pretty much just the Painkiller, Basilisk, Cass Special and the Perfectly Normal.

I experience some low 1% FPS a few times but nothing serious. The game crashed about 5 times. The first 4 times was because of the frame generation so I deactivated it and was fine after that.At the beginning I had trouble getting into the game as the server loading screen appeared at the same time as the terms and condition screen, just had to smash the space bar to bypass it.

It pains me to see this as the end of Arkane Studio. They made some of my favorite games and it's a shame we won't get another Dishonored/Prey/Deathloop kinda game.

It was a decent story, and while the game was far from perfect, it certainly had its moments of awesomeness and I enjoyed it. The moment it went on sale on Steam, I bought it immediately as it was worth the discounted price for sure, and I plan on trying out the other characters sometime in the future. 

The game was certainly dogpiled on at release. I wonder if it was because the game was that bad, or if it was just blind hatred towards Microsoft. I have a fleeting suspicion its the latter, but what do I know.

Either way, now that the game is dead and studio has been dissolved, its funny to see positive reviews coming in with fake ""Arkane deserved better"" stances. First people dump on the game constantly. Then when it fails and the studio is dissolved, they start virtue signalling. Nobody bought the game at launch, or after multiple updates, and that is all there is to it.

Try the game on Gamepass. If you like it, buy it. If you don't, you didn't lose much.",True,5,142
Redfall,1294810,168049484,"Having read on Twixxer that Harvey Smith considered patch 4 the finished version of the game and he was pleased that people were now enjoying it, I thiought I'd give Redfall a try. I love Dishonored with a passion, though I wish I liked the sequels; enjoy Deathloop; am more impressed by Prey than enjoying of it; and still have great fondness for Arx Fatalis and Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic. So I'm generally skewed toward favourable approaches to Arkane games.

Redfall got a legendary beating at release, and I can only imagine what it must have been like. At present after patch 4, it feels like a compromise of a game: solo play is cluttered with the kind of HUD icon spew that contaminates quite a few co-op games.

Enemy AI is really very poor - I generally play stealth but it's barely a viable option here as the NPC enemies spot you easily and their detection progress from 'huh?' to dogpiling you is *fast*. Mostly it's human enemies, being either vampire cultists or mercenaries, so you're going to get shot at most of the time. Vampires zip around and slash at you with their claws, and there's a fun twist on the old narrative where after wearing them down with bullets they can be seen off using a thrust from a shotgun or assault rifle with a wooden stake mounted in place of a bayonet.

The premise of the game is great - small town cut off from the world and being taken over by vampires, so far so 30 Days Of Night -  but there's no tension or horror here of the kind that make Dying Light so unnerving: if you're expecting a late-stage Salem's Lot/ I Am Legend (book not cr*ppy Will Smith movie) experience, you're going to be disappointed. The map itself has so much potential for that kind of slow-burning exploration, tense race against sundown gameplay: but it's basically Far Cry Vampires Edition,  just a lot of run-and-gun, health regen spamming, but with looter-shooter weapon drops (be ready to compare stats! Blue gun better than green gun! ugh). 

Absurdly for a vampire story, the day/night cycle seems to make no difference at all - vampires are out during the day (there is a black cast over the sun which one assumes is protecting them but the game doesn't tell you this) so the prospect of nightfall has no menace beyond worse visibility, and your flashlight is extremely powerful so that's hardly an issue.

I'll play to finish the game now it's in my library, but it's really not a good epitaph for Arkane Austin. It reeks of publisher interference, forced design decisions to try to chase trends which had already moved on, and a schizoid tone which fails to be either endearing or horrifying. Probably a good thing that my expectations were already low.

EDIT AFTER CAMPAIGN COMPLETION: Oh dear. Oh *dear*. Ending on a cliffhanger for DLC/sequel that are never going to be made was a bit of a boo-boo now wasn't it? Also my character's references to having encountered one of the vampire bosses and gaining his vampire eye (which grants exactly no powers) were never explained during my playthrough (though they are in a trailer, whut?) and I dread to think how incoherently the other characters backstories will be presented. Oh and several times I came across textures that looked like they'd been made with an AI art generator - gibberish glyph text on a poster, generic memorial plaque in a museum to name two - which contributes to the impression that this was a project doomed by pushy publishers demanding a team create a project of the kind they're not best at to meet a demand nobody in the gaming space made. Also why are characters' hands so damn enormous?? There's stylised art design and then there's the inverse-Rob Liefeld NPC models of Redfall. Wasted potential is probably the greatest artistic crime, and Redfall's maps (minus the clutter) could have been the setting for something atmospheric and memorable. Instead we got this unlovable turkey which frankly I can't recommend to anyone, and we haven't even got to some of the Joss Whedon-esque 'quips' that keep getting dropped. You know what?

I tried disabling steam overlay, and every third-party tool in system tray, verified game files, I know I have the latest nVidia 4090 drivers, 24GB VRAM etc. Basically no apparent reason for it to crash but it kept going and took the joy out of the game.
 
When the game crashes, you lose not only time, but also progress and loot. For example, I cleared a vampire nest, got out and got the rewards a min later game crashed and all were lost. Nest did not show up in the map either.

Update: I really wanted to finish the game but it is still crashing. I considered uninstall / reinstall, which had helped a bit with recent Star Wars. 
I reset all settings in case I may have changed something that was causing this (for example, I had increased FoV a bit). I actually thought it got better, but was probably placebo, it still crashes randomly, sometimes fine for 2-3hrs, other times crashes 5mins apart. Still no clue what the UE4 error is about, nothing on google. 

OK, will stop talking about crashes, although it is hard to ignore it. 

Gunplay .. OK, though I don't like the choices much.  Aim down-side is not great, view blocked most of the time, especially with pistols (yet how I loved healing from ""Painkiller""). Each level almost obsoletes the previous lvl guns, so constantly trying to get back favs. A few combos are  sometimes OP (UV + saw).

Redfall,1294810,167149047,"I can sum up this review in two words - wasted potential. If you can, snipe this game for cheap. $20 at the most. Grab a friend too.

Game has its moments and its appeal. I really wish they had more time to cook but unfortunately, the game was bogged down with a poor launch that kept folks away. They tried to address the issues in a timely manner but bug fixes and upgrades were not coming fast enough.

Gunplay feels arcade-y but not goofy. It doesn't come off like Call of Duty or Battlefield either. With only three weapon slots means you are forced to go into your inventory a lot and swap out weapons. I found myself keeping the UV weapon in slot three equipped at all times because it was just too valuable to unequip, meaning I was constantly swapping out the first two weapon slots to whatever was needed for the situation. My one gripe early on was you hold so little ammunition and feel forced to invest in the ammo perks early on if you don't want to swap guns all the time.

Movement is basic, not including abilities or perks. With more perks and abilities, movement allows you to get into some interesting places rather quickly, bypassing (sometimes locked) doors or repositioning yourself into a higher area for an advantage.

Voices are good but your character just WILL NOT SHUT UP. After every fight they comment and it will most likely force people to disable voices. I found myself forced to disable voices to continue playing and retaining my sanity.

Exploring and scavenging felt natural and not forced. I did not feel compelled to go out of my way to farm or focus on something in particular, outside of collectibles.  My one gripe is lockpicks and hacking tools were limited you being able to carry three at a time. There are certain perks that reduce the chance to use one but still, only three being the cap? Jacob has a perk that increases his lockpick count to 8 and there are, usually, ways around locked doors such as windows in certain places, etc. Lockpicks only work on doors, safes and certain chests. If you're a loot goblin like me, you are compelled to open all the things.

Menus were straight to the point. The information you need is categorized in a way that's easy to find and navigate with minimal fluff, with text that's easy to read. You will also be spending a lot of time in the inventory screen swapping out weapons so get comfortable with that. I also enjoyed the red text format. 

Quests are pretty standard but a few twists here and there kept me wary of approaching certain quests the way you normally would. ""Go here, find X"" but X turns out to be a trap. Don't trust things you hear over the radio or TVs.

Characters have their own identity and skillset, meaning playing with friends as different characters comes off as necessary, sorta. Each compliment one another but you can still solo without anyone. Skill trees are expanded through skill points, acquired from leveling up, killing mini-bosses, doing certain quests, etc. My first several bunch of points went straight into increasing my ammo count because I was tired of having to swap weapons so often.

Enemies ranging from standard melee vampires to humans with guns. The AI for the standard vampire comes off as jank because they seem to have no real sense of self-preservation while saying they'll eviscerate you. They also run at you in some strange angles and weird ways that the animation looks goofy while looking at you with a >:( face. There's a few other types of special vampires as well as unique variants of humans such as humans that summon help or build turrets to attack you. I won't spoil the vampire variants but I do recommend you aim for the head. 

Also as a side note - If you are using an RTX card, do not enable DLSS. Your game will crash a lot. A shame the game will most likely never get patched to improve it.

Overall, the game is just okay. It's very unfortunate the game will not receive anymore updates. If this game had more time to cook and had a better launch, I daresay this game could've been pretty damn good. Maybe not GOTY material, but still enjoyable all the same.",True,5,1109

Redfall,1294810,166803558,"My review of [i]Redfall[/i] is in response to the latest and final update the game received (May 2024), as someone who has played it on launch. 

I will say upfront at launch it was a mess. I thankfully played it on Gamepass and finished it through till its end. Glitches, bugs, dumb AI and all. I liked the premise of the game and the world building despite its problems. I can certainly understand the backlash, especially from those who paid full price for this game or beyond the standard base game. 

[i]I do recommend this game in its state now but at a heavily reduced price.[/i] I paid $20 for this game and deem it worth that much for the hours I got out of it. Also I have not experienced co-op mode, my review is from playing single player only. 

[h3]The Story[/h3]

The town of Redfall has been besieged by darkness and vampires. You explore the origins of the vampire threat as one of four main characters, all with unique traits and abilities. The story itself is a strength in this game, sadly hindered by the short-comings of the game mechanics. 

[h3]Gameplay & Features[/h3]

I am writing this review from the standpoint that you know what an open world fps game is and hopefully this is not your first experience with one…that would [i]bite[/i].

The different characters with their own abilities are fun. The first time I played through with Devinder and this run I played as Layla. I like her ability of the lift. It gets you up to hard to reach high places fast. The weapons themselves feel okay. I like the addition of staking the vampires after weakening them. But overall the game still has a lot of dumb AI. The enemies are more responsive than before but not enough. I found I enjoyed more of my time looking for collectables and focusing on the story. 

I really like the addition of the Community Standing chart where you can spend points after opening up the safehouses by completing safehouse quests and  freeing captives. They added a lot of great stuff that can be eventually unlocked through this system. Being able to find the Grave Locks and cosmetics revealed on the map was a huge time saver in my second run. 

Also I never experienced any crashes or stutters in my full play time with the game on Steam so despite in-game issues with some dumb AI or pop-ins from time to time the game overall ran pretty smoothly. Also you can remap keys (I recommend a programmable mouse if you have one). 

[h3]Two points in the game to beware of…[/h3]

Once you leave the first map (Redfall Commons) to travel to map 2 (Burial Point) you cannot go back to the first map so finish all objectives on the first map before heading into the second one! 

Once you finish off the main boss (the Black Sun) the game will restart you in Redfall Commons in a new game+. You keep your character progression but all collectables respawn and once again you're locked within only Redfall Commons. 

[i]I can understand not being able to continue on after the final boss but I do wish that in the final update they could have allowed us to travel back and forth between maps to finish achievements.[/i] 

[h3]The Visuals[/h3]

The greatest strength this game has is world building. The game world is incredibly detailed. I enjoy looking in the houses and buildings, jumping around the rooftops and finding secret rooms and easter eggs. I love games where a lot of the time you can actually go into the buildings and explore. 

For starters I love the game's concept and key art you can find online. In game I am not a fan. The characters look lifeless and ridgid. A lot of the time just repeating the same actions or sayings over and over. The cut-scenes were well done and reflect what your character is wearing in game at the time. More scene captures as opposed to animated cutscenes. 

[h3]Overall Experience[/h3]

I love Arkane games with Dishonored being one of my all time favorites and really enjoying my time with Prey. This will never be the game it could have been but I am happy to see offline support make its way to the game before the servers are gone.

I really enjoyed the narrative of this game and the world itself. The story of Redfall is complete for the most part at the end of the game with some parts of the story left open ended. Sadly anything going forward is pretty much limited to our imaginations.  ⚰️

Redfall has received overwhelmingly negative feedback due to its high price tag, poor performance, lackluster gameplay, and numerous bugs. Many users feel the game is unfinished and not worth its $70 price, comparing it unfavorably to other AAA titles.

Key Issues Highlighted:
Price: Many reviewers are outraged by the $70 price, feeling it’s too high for an indie-quality game in early access.
Performance: The game suffers from severe performance issues, including low frame rates and poor optimization even on high-end hardware.
Gameplay: The AI is considered weak, controls are clunky, and the open world is described as empty and boring.
Graphics: Described as average and not meeting the expectations for a AAA title.
Story: The narrative is shallow, and the world lacks meaningful interaction or environmental storytelling.
Refunds: Many users have refunded the game, and even those who received it for free feel it wasn’t worth the cost.",False,23,136

Overall, I enjoy the atmosphere and the way combat feels. The moment to moment gameplay is simple and entertaining. Redfall's gunplay feels just like Deathloop and can get intense. Also, the sound design is decent, the weapons sound nice, and the music is very unique. 

I've played this on the Steam Deck (which is why my hours are so low) as well as the Legion Go (the Xbox PC version where I have 20+ hours clocked) and I have to say that the game performs very well. It's probably one of the best performing games in my library (both on the Steam Deck and Xbox PC).

If you're into older FPS titles from the PS3/Xbox 360 era, then chances are you'll probably enjoy Redfall. The story is intriguing enough to pay attention to and the """"cutscenes"""" are literal slideshows, but what really makes Redfall enjoyable for me is the actual gameplay (as simple as it is) and the feel of combat.

It has its issues, and it's far from being Arkane at their best, but it has a great atmosphere and had a ton of potential. The vampire hunter aspect is pretty cool too, with UV lights and wooden stakes as weapons.

Obviously there's a decent amount of issues. The game is buggy, lacks variety in a lot of ways, doesn't have the same tier of level design as other Arkane games, has a pretty annoying loot system, and the emergent gameplay is pretty bland. It kind of ends up being a pretty straightforward open zone shooter with some sandbox elements. I was excited for the new heroes and updates, and was holding off until some content before giving the game another shot, but lo and behold the news of Austin being shut down came out and crushed any hope of that.

I never felt to burned by the game because I did get it for free, and on one of it's $17 sales it is really a lot of fun for a bit. There's a final offline update coming out with a bit more content, and I hope they open it up to modding after that so the community can attempt to continue the game. This game has one of my favorite original worlds that Arkane has come up with, and I'm pretty sad they never got the chance to really allow that to happen.

So I pretty much am giving this game a good review because I think it gets a bad rep, and to let Arkane know that this game DID have its fans and those of us who wanted the game to improve. I enjoyed my time in the spooky town of Redfall.

Redfall,1294810,165229684,"I'll straight up say pass on this one. Gameplay is admittedly decent, a looter shooter the likes of Borderlands with a Vampire coat of paint. Gun play feels solid, and the idea of open world vampire hunting and shooting up cultists is fine enough, but thats mostly where any positives stop. Enemies even on their harder difficulties are laughable. Sure, it was even easier back when it first came out, but even post patch its a breeze. Enemy path finding makes me feel like this was pure after thought, with even now certain enemies just unable to figure out player position and elevation correctly. Dispatching vampires can be awkward, as you need a stake to finish the job or UV light (barring specific hero abilities or some super unique weapon). This alone shouldn't be an issue except for the fact that only certain types of weapons have a stake attachment and specific tech weapons using UV light. Without any hand held stake to melee finish a vampire, you're rather limited or forced to use certain classes of weapons for vampire killing (once again, barring certain hero abilities that can bypass that which will vary from person to person). Story was... mostly forgettable. Very few points while playing did the game have my attention in terms of dialogue, and the cut scenes are just freeze frames of 3d models despite the game itself having animation during game play. Its such a bizarre choice that only further paints this game as a half baked product. For online Co-op, the game balance gets even more thrown out the window as if enemies just weren't properly scaled to take on 2 or more players. When the party is intentionally trying to draw the attention of The Rook (an allegedly punishing opponent for drawing too much attention from the head vampire) to just trash him like hes a side quest boss, something is really off. This game isn't even an indie game, this is suppose to be a AAA experience. This came out the door with a 70 fucking dollar price tag; and that's the ""basic"" version not including season pass crap that would demand you a total of about 100 dollars for the full experience. Its beyond shameful, because the ones who pushed this out the door clearly had no shame to hold them back. Now with the developer team effectively terminated, don't expect much more fixing beyond this point. Is it worth playing? At a discount at best, fun was had by myself because I wasn't soloing and got this game on a significant discount. With no further updates in the works, and season pass content cancelled, I don't expect a very active player base to remain playing this if there even is anyone still online.

Redfall,1294810,165222785,"[h1][i]Bordlerlands[/i] with vampires[/h1]

TLDR, this is basically [i]Borderlands[/i] but with vampires rather than sci fi. I play with not-Gaige who summons a friendly vampire rather than a robot like OG Gaige. 

[h1]If it were sold for $20, it would be a decent buy.[/h1]

[b]UPDATE:[/b] Microsoft is apparently planning to release the final patch after all. 

https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040

If this were a $20 indie game, it would be considered a decent AA game with an interesting premise. However, rather than sell it for what it was worth, Microsoft decided to push it out before it was ready (Bethesda style) and then sell it for $70 + Season Pass.

Right now it's in a bundle on Fanatical which means you can get it and another game for $25 which is worth it in my opinion

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

It's an FPS with stealth and way too many guns. If you can imagine Borderlands with more stealth and tougher enemies (the Vampires at least are tougher than the enemies in Borderlands) it's basically that.

One significant minus is that the ammo is expensive and seems hard to find. More ammo, cheaper ammo, or simply ammo that automatically refills between missions would have made this game better. 

[h1]Setting[/h1]

If you liked [i]Evil West[/i] you will probably like the setting of this game. 

This has a gothic, vampire themed setting which I quite like. In particular, I like that you are fighting the vampires rather than being one. It's enjoyably cheesy in a way which more or less matches the tone of [i]The Secret World[/i] but with an emphasis on vampires rather than conspiracy theories. 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3246518759

If you are fan of [i]Welcome to Nightvale[/i] or Neil Gaiman books like [i]Coraline,[/i] you will probably like it OK. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6kPXH9HJvE

One thing I disliked is that the setting goes too far in my opinion insofar as things have gotten so out of hand that everyone you meet besides your crew is either a Vampire, a cultist working for the vampires, or a literal prisoner waiting to be rescued. It would have been better to use the enemies more sparingly in my opinion to have an atmosphere that would be more mysterious and unsettling as opposed to post-apocalyptic.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Very basic and told via voice-overs, lore items and images rather like the extended cut of the [i]Mass Effect 3[/i] ending.

So sad to see Arkane fall so hard from Dishonored.

UPDATE: I didn't think I'd see it happen. Arkane Austin, right before they were shut down, put out one last update to Redfall, making some improvements to the game, and, most importantly, they added an offline mode. While I'll certainly applaud Arkane Austin for being able to squeeze this update out before they were shut down, it still doesn't really help to make the game much better. I wish all developers working at Arkane Austin the best of luck in the future, and all executives at Microsoft and Bobby Kotick specifically, a nice, big, extra pointy cactus to shove up their ass.

Redfall,1294810,164848134,"[h1] Those darn vampires and their darned climate change! [/h1]

[b] Redfall [/b] is a game developed by Arkane Austin, developers of Prey, but you would absolutely not be able to tell without the splash screen on boot up. Ignoring how this game is a massive downgrade from Prey, it is fundamentally different. However, the game itself admittedly isn't what drove me to write this review, hell if things went differently I might have been willing to give it a POSITIVE one. It's more so...recent events surrounding the developer and the games future.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
[b] Redfall [/b] is a looter-hero-shooter, I'll say it right fucking here, this game plays nothing like an Arkane game. Through the open world of Redfall (which is split into two maps depending on story progression), you kill vampires and their cultists, get weapons of varying rarity and stats, level up and use skills....yeah there's no magic in the traditional Arkane sense; there are four characters (would have been six but MORE ON THAT LATER), known as Heroes, and each of them have their own skills, with two cooldowns and one ultimate that needs a recharge. Only two characters have skills that could fall under magic, and I didn't pick either of them. I need me my on-demand flashbang dammit. 

In terms of mission structure, at multiple points you can select one of multiple missions(though it's more of a ""which one do you do first"" rather than a proper choice), and at certain points you need to acquire skulls to progress, done by completing Safehouse Missions. This is like the most obvious padding in the history of video games, but at least you can get them done with early. Contrary to what people say, this game is NOT like Left 4 Dead; it's simply NOT a horde shooter. It's more like Dying Light in mission structure (as well as in enemy variants).

Stealth is possible but is very bare bones (if it wasn't obvious for the fact an update had to add cultist stealth takedowns), so loud is very much the preferred approach. Then again, not like I played Prey stealthily either.

The gameplay in general is a massive stepdown from Prey, but honestly I kinda liked it, I definitely had some fun with the game. Not one of the greatest games ever made, but I think you could find worse. I mean, for a studio which never did co-op, open world or live-service before and were forced to (including the inclusion of vampires, that was forced too), it's not exactly good but honestly it's not the worst.

[h2] Story [/h2]
Scientists make vampires real, blocking off the titular island town of Redfall via sea tides and a permanent eclipse. We have the technology. We can science magic into reality.

Meanwhile, [strike] six with DLC [/strike] four shitheads end up getting plot armoured and being the ones to kill the vampires; totally not Insomniac Spider-Man ex-military Jacob, magic wielding uni student in crippling debt Layla, idk Remi and her robot Bribon, and self proclaimed ""cryptid hunter"" Devinder. 

Redfall's story won't set the world on fire. It absolutely did not. But honestly I didn't hate it. There are some exposition missions but aside from that it's relatively well paced.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
I played on low, which resulted in ABSURD pop-in (especially with the shadows), and I had FSR on which resulted in less than stellar image quality. The UI itself has issues, with copious amounts of default Unreal Engine 4 UI font. Artisically, it's not really unique but it looks pretty nice.

[h2]Beyond Opinion [/h2]
[i] Note: As of today's (May 30th 2024) update a lot of this rant is void, but I'm still keeping it for posterity. [/i]

Warning: the following text is going to be dramatic as an edgy 2010's emo fanfic. You have been warned.

Now what I said is very much my opinion. The following is also admittedly my opinion despite the subheading. But there's a difference between an opinion about a game's various components and what I'm about to write.

You will walk through rocks. You will get semi-stuck between rocks(you can get out easily bur your viewmodel will spaz out). Your Heroes hands will get freaky when using a skill. Your character will t-pose in menus. You will ocassionally be told you can't connect to the Arknet despite being fine, and you will need to brute force your way into the game. The HUD will cut off at lower resolutions. You will fall through the ground(though that might be a HDD issue). Performance probably still isn't fully fixed. These are just some of the issues I experienced. Not saying it's launch-state Cyberpunk 2077, but compared to other games it is terifically below par.

Redfall in it's current state is broken as shit.

And it will remain broken as shit.

Today as of writing this review, Arkane Austin is announcing to be shutting down. Of course this means no Prey 2, but this also cause a more pressing matter at hand; the future of Redfall. With their shutdown, they have announced the cessation of further development. Now this would be fine if it was basic updates right? But no.

As part of the [i] Bite Back [/i] edition, you would have been able to get access to two new Heroes. This will now not occur and you can get a refund for the value of the BB upgrade's price.I didn't buy the Bite Back edition (no way I would pay 85 quid for this game), but still.

But what I'd say more importantly, is the lack of further patches, and the fact that offline mode is no longer coming.

Admittedly this review has gotten a bit dramatic, but you have NEVER heard a game studio announce ""we'll add offline mode"" and then go ""umm actually you're not getting offline mode"". Even though this happening to Redfall isn't the biggest deal in the world, it surely doesn't set a good precedent. What if this happened to Sea of Thieves? Halo Infinite? People would be absolutely losing their bloody minds. 

And on top of that, they will keep the game as broken as it is. If they were also pulling the game from sale or something, sure that'd probably mean they'd shut it down but it's not that big of a deal. Redfall would just be a drop in video game history. A stain in the long road.

But as of writing, Redfall is currently still for purchase; the Bite Back edition isn't anymore, no, but the game itself is, and it is very apparent to me this will be like this for the long run. Bethesda likely has the money to keep the game going for stupid long periods of time.

In my personal opinion, the continued sale of Redfall in its current state amounts to a scam. You may argue it was always a scam sure, but this has made it definite. There is NO way in hell Microsoft does not know how fucking scuffed this game is on a technical level. To bail out on it and STILL take money for it is, to me, absurd.

And as of writing, they were working on the DLC eight hours ago actually. They were working on the DLC and then they get shut down.

Arkane Austin was really forced to make a game they were not prepared for, and then proceeded to get killed when the end result doesn't end up being peak, ESPECIALLY while they are actively working to improve said game post-launch.

Fucking hell Microsoft.

And not to mention they also shut down other studios, including Tango Gameworks. What the fuck did THEY do? They did nothing wrong. Certified bruh moment


UPDATE 17/05/2024: So the tweets all said there will be no more updates but Hi-Fi Rush got one final update like a couple days ago so uhh hopium sesh time????????

So, with those expectations, Redfall fails to live up to them. But, for the price of 7.5 (there was a 75% sale when I purchased it), it's an okay game. The graphics are very good and fun. But the characters have little to no depth, cutscenes and story are bland, the gameplay and quests are little bit boring and gets repetitive very quickly. I mean for me, this game is like combining Borderlands, Far Cry, Dying Light and then taking the 25% of the combination. The guns get very weak with every level we get, just like in Borderlands. This made me use a lot of different weapons so I guess that was nice. But the safehouses, (or antennas in Far Cry and Dying Light) have the same 3 quests and then killing a boss. Gets very repetitive very quick. Sometimes, you don't know you're dying because there is not much of a clear indication of noises that alert you enough.

Redfall,1294810,163754554,"Redfall never deserved most bad reviews it has been given. The game was being review-bombed before it even released on multiple sites because fans of other IPs created by Arkane Studios were upset Arkane hadn't made a new version of one of their favorite games instead of this one--that's on those fans, not the game or studio.

Were there issues with Redfall's release? Absolutely. What new release doesn't have bugs? No game in the history of video gaming ever. Are there legitimate gripes to be made? Sure, but most poor reviews consist of complaints made by people with very little play time about issues other games have largely been given a pass on--games with remarkable review histories with the exact same issues.

So, one year after release, what big negatives remain: 1) online only, even for solo play; and 2) the price tag. The first is the kind of crap I have come to expect from Bethesda and certainly not Arkane's fault; and, importantly, it doesn't reflect on the game, itself (but may influence a purchase). The second can be resolved with buying it on sale (which I completely recommend), because however good the game may be, it's not worth $70 a pop. I have bought this twice--once as a full price gift prior to release, and once for myself on sale. With a good sale, at nearly sixty hours of play time, I've gotten far more value out of my dollar than my Netflix subscription.

Personal negatives? Outside of the two big ones, above: 1) not being able to make a manual save is a bit frustrating, especially since a few bugs remain that could pop up and prevent you from acquiring a 'one chance per playthrough' achievement. That can be rough if you're an achievement hunter; 2) I'd like to see whatever is causing occasional issues with movement in the game resolved. Whether it is enemies or heroes getting caught on invisible architecture, or heroes not being able to simply climb into the back of a van without vaulting over it; 3) someone please redo the voice lines for the Raven, preferably with an actual corvid -- the voice, now, is just bad (but thankfully, not heard often).

The positives? The atmosphere is great. I absolutely loved the depiction of a Northeastern US island town. The way the story unfolds like a mystery instead of being handed to you on the silver platter. The characters and voice acting are both very well done (with the glaring exception of the Raven). And the playable heroes are interesting, with intriguing power sets that can have impactful play styles.

I had a lot of fun, and expect to have more in the future. So, if you're on the fence, but online-only isn't a deal breaker AND Redfall is on sale? Try it. Hopefully, you'll like it as much or more than I have.",True,7,3650
Redfall,1294810,163645663,"Entering a game knowing it's bad is a different affair. I am more relaxed without any fear of missing out anything which might be vital to the plot. I don't have any expectation so I am not nitpicking as much as I would've in a 96 metascore game. 
Now, the game is not good, make no mistake, but it's not 4/10 bad. I am playing it 1 year after launch and most of the technical problems seem to be fixed bar 2 crashes early on.

That being said, let's talk about the game part of the game. I can't tell you how bad the story is because it's so poorly told that it lost me 1 hour in. The gameplay is pretty fun and involving but it encourages you to stealth with a hand by making most enemies really strong later on, while simultaneously not giving you any means of stealth with the other. So 90% i just killed everyone and it was functional.
The worst thing is the dialogue, and in particular, the protagonist. If it was ever a time when I missed the silent protagonist was now. This guy will just not shut up and everytime he talks I want to strangle him. Don't get me wrong, all of the characters are like this but they are very few with really limited interactions so if that were all it would have been tolerable. No! My guy just needs to comment on everything and over-explain any plot developments in a ""comedic"" fashion until any subtlety flies out the window. 
This, in turn, lead to an unbelievable clashing of tones, because, against all odds, the game is pretty atmospheric in missions. Really need to stay on my toes, gameplay-wise, and story-wise, the situation is quite horrific. If only they kept the dialogue method of dishonored, short, serious, and to the point, the game would have only been pretty bad instead of aggressively bad to the point that I feel personally assaulted. 

Probably the guys who made dishonored and prey don't even work at Arkane, so I won't hold my breath for their next title, Blade, especially because, being a superhero, they will inevitable give it a go with that ""wacky marvel dialogue""      .",False,18,1348

Redfall,1294810,163477788,"Update after 55+ hours. So have got to the end and completed the game once over in 'Dusk' difficulty level and all the side missions + neighbourhoods. I'll admit to not reading all the little notes and I found about 60 of the 100 grave notes. 

I'll admit to really loving the game in the end and got addicted eventually, but only after the first 5 or 6 hours of play. I don't know what it is about the early experience of it that put me off, but once I was in control, I started to settle in and couldn't put it down.

I loved the game mechanics, despite a handful of minor bugs here and there (I did pick the game up for the first time 12 months post release, so I guess most things people complained about were fixed).

It's pretty immersive, the art direction is pretty incredible, loved the music - Story could have been a little better, but you do get into it more by ""Burial Point"" (which is the 2nd area map / set of neighbourhoods).

Looking at my game achievement scores, I can see that only 12% of people who buy this game complete it and a lot of the achievements have very low player percentage of achievement, which is a shame really. Think more people should have given the game a chance and I'm pretty surprised by the 'mostly negative' reviews.

If you're sitting on the fence about it, I would say the game doesn't disappoint. It's entertaining to play, especially with a friend and we both loved it. Most of the negativity is related to the first 12 months where the game was released at full price as a 'finished' game, but was largely buggy and incomplete. Those issues have since been resolved for the most part (although some minor bugs still remain end of May 2024).



--
Update after 18 hours:  So, I have to say, I am enjoying this game. The negative rep this game has attracted is not the sum of its parts in my opinion. I'm playing along with a friend and neither of us can understand why people find it awful. It's a fun shooter. 

I suppose they could have gone full horror with it, but to be honest I quite like the cheeky lightheartedness of it. That's just a matter of personal styling, I think it would work either way. There's plenty of variety to keep you immersed in the game. The loot you're picking up to gain cash which you can use to buy better weapons if available at the safe houses, restock on ammo, etc.

I like the different missions, the music design is well thought out and I personally like the graphics.

There are a few glitches here and there, opening some of the locked cases, the sliding instead of walking of team mates sometimes... But to be honest they are very small, not really noticeable and don't ruin the overall enjoyment of the game.

If this is still available at a low price, I would say the game is a steal and definitely worth the money.

----
So I've played around three hours or so and I don't consider this game to be as bad as a lot are still saying. It seems people are hating on it just because the pitchforks are out, or maybe it got off to a bad start almost a year ago now. I know I'm late to the party, but I'm enjoying this version as it stands so far. I wouldn't say it's the best game I've ever played, but I certainly don't dislike it by any stretch. So what do I like and dislike?

Well I got it on offer for £14.99 and in my opinion, it's definitely worth that. I like the story, I like the artwork and scenery. The missions are interesting and I'm enjoying the exchange of fire with vamps and hollowmen! So in terms of beauty and entertainment, I'd say it gets high marks.

So where is it failing? I'm playing solo game coop with a friend and we're having a lot of fun... But, the reward/loot factor is too high - We're always fully stocked up and so the challenge diminishes. This game has a balance problem and I think they could do with addressing that. I've only played a few hours, so I'm early into third or fourth mission, so the challenge could get harder...(?)

The music and sound design is excellent, love that. But the sound direction feels off. It's a bit disorientating hearing an enemy behind, but it's not there at all. Maybe that's just me, not sure.

I'll be sure to come back and add to my review after a few more hours and missions in. But so far, if you're sitting on the fence, I'd say go for it. There's a lot worse games out there at higher prices. Redfall deserves another chance!",True,3,4814

Redfall,1294810,161425081,"OLDER GAMER HERE, I started gaming on a Sinclair ZX-81 back in the early 1980s.

I found this to be a masterpiece of a game, STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. 10 out of 10 — one of the most enjoyable games I have EVER played.

It was wise of me to disregard the negative reviews. 

I bought a Steam code for €15.74 from Fanatical (March 2024), and I have to say that I am loving every minute I have played so far. Here is what I enjoy:

(1) The game code is very well optimized. My nVidia RTX 3060 12 Gb fan barely makes any noise while playing the game, with most settings maxed. The game never crashed on me even ALT-TABing out of it, e.g. in order to check something on the Internet, and ALT-TABing back into the game.

(2) The game is first-person view only, and open world, of medium size. The in-game map is clear and easy to read. Lots of houses and locations to investigate. You can fast travel between safe houses and monuments or walk — no cars or other vehicles (not that they are needed, the world is not that big).

(3) The graphics are very well done and very atmospheric. They remind me of Fallout 4 and The Sinking City. The attention to detail is amazing and so is the movement of the character. You step over every little object — and I never got stuck even moving into tight corners.

(4) The story is absolutely gripping. You have to deal with cultists and vampires. The game scratches my zombie itch in that respect.

(5) The interface is simple and elegantly done. Not super confusing as in other games I love, e.g. The Division.

(6) There are skills to unlock that are organized on a skill tree that does not feel overly complicated.

(7) There are safe houses to unlock, usually after turning their power on and occasionally after beating the cultists that defend them. The game reminded me of Far Cry and Dying Light in this respect.

(8) You can parkour! In addition to jumping, when you press the SPACE BAR, your hands reach up and you climb to whatever you are looking at. Moving from one roof to another in the city at night is just amazing.

(9) Destroying a vampire lair is a lot of fun. You enter the lair through a door, and the lair feels like an alternate reality, sort of like a neighborhood that looks wrong, in which you have to find and destroy the heart, and after that make it out of the lair in less than a minute.

(10) If you enjoy searching houses, yards, and other locations for items, you are going to love this game. And whatever you collect, get converted to currency immediately — you don't have to sell it anywhere.

(11) Finally, daylight, the easiest difficulty, is doable for kludges like me, although it can get challenging when more than one Vampires are attacking you. The boss fights don't seem unfair.

TIP: When you first start the game, you may have to disable any external displays (that are in a different resolution than your main one) in order to get all resolutions to show up in the Settings.

I may update my review as I continue playing the game, but felt I should provide some immediate input, considering the mixed response this wonderful game seems to have received so unfairly, in my opinion.",True,6,1968

Redfall,1294810,160563926,"A Promising Concept hindered by Short Length and Development Bugs

One of the most glaring issues with Redfall is its brevity. Despite boasting a captivating world filled with rich lore and interesting characters, the main campaign feels disappointingly short-lived. Players may find themselves completing the primary storyline in a matter of hours, leaving them craving more depth and substance. This lack of content ultimately detracts from the game's potential longevity and replay value.
Furthermore, Redfall is marred by several development bugs that hinder the gameplay experience. From occasional framerate drops to AI pathfinding issues, players may encounter a variety of technical glitches that detract from immersion and disrupt the flow of gameplay. These bugs can range from minor annoyances to game-breaking issues, leading to frustration and disappointment.

Anyway. I wanted to like it.

I really did. But alas, it just... pushes you away every chance it gets. The world is a bit empty, the NPCs that do exist have zero depth. When I go to slide, my character will slide like 100000 feet before finally stopping and its impossible to aim and shoot while that happens. Its impossible to know just how many vampires are going to be in an area. If you see only 2, assume there are 10. The radar is laughable. Questionable? Exclamatory. 

I only paid ~$17 for it, and I still feel kind of ripped off. It has an unfinished quality to it. Like they had a great idea, and just couldn't be bothered to follow all the way through. A young teenager may enjoy it. Otherwise, I just can't recommend this one.",False,62,99

Redfall,1294810,159437870,"So I have played Redfall.  Beaten it once with one character, began with another character and stopped.

The world has a very Arkane feel to it, which if you've played any of their games, you'll appreciate. There is a ton of really cool worldbuilding elements and small stories in little places that showcase an event happened here and that's really dope. 
For all intents and purposes Redfall feels like a real place which is very cool. Kinda washed out like a contemporary Dunwall. There are things like birds circling houses which is cool and the storm before a Rook arrives is very cool. Additionally, the set pieces surrounding the bosses are cool but the bosses themselves are very been there done that.

The characters are fine. I played as the coast guard character and found it fine, playing as the psychic character I found the internal monologue eye-rolling. 
The gunplay is balls, characters become bulletsponges instead of becoming smarter or more elusive, some builds are just useless, you'll never need the sniper person like ever because most skirmishes don't merit actual prep planning when you can just cheese everything. 
The story is very hit and miss, there are some beats that are really cool, but the throughline is garbage. 
Finally, and it might seem nitpicky. Put some fucking cinematics in the game. It's just jarring to do to the comicbook thing because it's basically a sign to tune out and go grab a drink.

In a lot of ways, this reminds me of Anthem because it's yet another example of a developer whose strengths lie in crafting sophisticated single player experiences but somehow they got involved in producing a co-op looter shooter. Every now and then while playing you will notice glimpses of that studio's signature style of gameplay, but most of the time your brain will barely process it as a background task while you're in deep thought about what's for dinner.

This game and Arkane deserved better. Besides the crazy amount of miss-able achievements this game is pretty good and worth getting.  Its fun solo and I would love to play coop, but sadly those days have passed. 


Original review: I have tried to get into it a few times. I actually enjoy the gameplay and the setting. I like the designs and ascetics. But this game plays very poorly, also some of the gameplay choices, such as non replayable missions and a huge amount of missable achievements, suck.",True,0,2575

No, it still has issues but it is a decent bit of fun and I still find myself having a challenge on nightmare, still have yet to beat the game and play on the hardest difficulty and will update this once I do.

Redfall at its core has potential to be a great game but it fell short and now has a horrible reputation.  Having to start up an entirely new run for just wanting to switch characters is annoying, along with story progression not carrying over from co-op play.  The updates and patches for this game are slow but each one is adding much needed QOL changes and improvements.  The characters are quite fun to play and their kits do have good synergy and are strong by themselves.  The dialogue is still very much Arkane but in a more comedic way while still keeping the dark tones of the game.  The characters and gameplay loop is fun but the AI still has its faults.

The AI is still decently dumb but not as buggy and or as stupid as they were at launch.  They aren't anything incredible but they do their job of being cannon fodder while the vampires are the main threat.  The vampires have decent AI and can prove to be a challenge to take down in groups, especially with the different variants that are in the game.  I will say the Rook needs more work as in my opinion they are the easiest to take down despite them supposed to be a major mini-boss of sorts.  Attack patterns are simple and easy to avoid.

A small note to add is the fact this game is still online only, hopefully it follows most games that realized this error like Payday 3 and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and adds one.

I do believe this game can recover and be something good and not be a lasting blow on Arkane Austin.  It definitely needs more time and fixes to be in that state.  Solo or tagging a friend along, its a fun time but its still not worth the $70.  $30 is more what this game is worth to me at least in the state that it is in right now.  It is a fun time regardless though from my experience.

It's a shame to see this last part of my review can't and wont be true to do the shutdown of Arkane Austin and many other studios. My statement still stands with it being bought on a discount with the last update the devs pushed out, really is a shame to see that this update was fixing parts of the game and fleshing it out more, wish I could see what else they had planned before the door was shut on them.

TL;DR I would say this game is worth at least maybe $30 in its current state and is a decent time solo or co-op, though would definitely say get a friend in if possible.  These games are much more fun with friends.",True,5,1965

Redfall,1294810,158036811,"Gonna give it a yes, but it's definitely almost a no.  If I hadn't picked this up for $18 I wouldn't be super happy about it. 

The gun play feels really bad to me at least compared to shooters like call of duty or destiny.  Looting is fairly boring.  Vampires are not fun to fight at all.  They just get in your face via teleporting making it hard to aim because they are so close on the camera.  Just makes me feel constantly crowded/claustrophobic.  

The guns don't handle well at all.  Reload speeds are just awfully slow like there's a vampire chewing on you, maybe put a tiny bit of effort into speeding up that reload. Skip the tactical reload, dump that mag on the ground and get the next one in like maybe your life depends on it, lol.  I realize I'm playing a young college girl who probably never touched a gun in her life but damn it just feels awful to play.

Finally, dodging.. I spend most of my play time in a sprint away from the fight while I reload, trying to guess the exact moment I should slide to avoid the claws.  All this without being able to see, so it's pretty much a guess.  When in close quarters there is no way to mitigate or avoid vampire damage.  No dodge mechanic, no block, it's face tank and shoot or do the run and slide thing. 

Thumbs up because I got 11 hours of entertainment about it even if I finally realized it's just not fun for me running away, sliding, spinning around shooting, running away, sliding ... you get the point.  Maybe ""end game"" or later in the game guns actually start hurting the vampires fast enough that you don't need to do the run and slide stuff, but as I aged I stopped playing games that weren't fun while ""leveling"" because what's the point really.

Redfall,1294810,157772376,"Janky in many ways and definitely very buggy, especially in Co-op. However, there is a fun Arkane skeleton underneath the jank. The world is easily the best part with lots of attention to detail in hidden areas and environmental storytelling everywhere. That being said, the gameplay loop doesn't do much to reward exploration of that world in the way previous Arkane games have which is a shame. There is plenty of lore if you're interested in that type of thing and the main characters have fun personalities, even if they are a bit cliche.
 The game definitely suffers from being a looter shooter and even a co-op game in a few ways. There was the potential for a really cool, tense, vampire killing, stealthy game here but it definitely fell short of the fantastic bar Arkane have set for themselves.

- Interesting aesthetic & atmosphere
- Setting/world & theme are interesting albeit underdevelopped.
- FPS system is 'okay'. There are some interesting ideas like the UV & Stakes. But all in all very basic.
- Overall the mechanism and rpg system is functional.
- There is a bit of creepyness here and there especially early on but it only goes so far. The chosen aesthetic probably diminishes the horror/suspense.

Contra's:

- The main plot is pretty boring.
- Engagement is limited. It feels very cookie cutter.
- Political correctness and 'Hello Fellow Kids' vibe all over the place.
- The combat does nothing special and there is little depth.

First play through I selected tutorials but they're very limited, so I didn't know that vampires may leave a collectable residue when killed and since the residue glows weakly, especially during the day it's virtually unnoticeable. yes you might see the ashes but not realise that they're collectable.  I killed several dozens before noticing a weak glow during a sundown. also not explained by the tutorials: the meaning of the chomping jaws that occasionally appear in a corner (red teeth) or on storage box contents (white on black), or the fact that the ultra-vast majority of objects you can pick up are not stored but instantly converted to cash. the backpack has 40 slots and I could never fill it, well it turns out that this is shown in text that can't be made larger and I am vision impaired. I needed someone to tell me what was happening. There's no pause function, understandable for online/coop play but not offline. I was killed very literally hundreds of times while tweaking the settings or answering a call and of course it's one of those games where you get charged for dying... all that cash collected, gone tweaking settings.

You go back to your last death locations where you have collectables from dead enemies, and in the 3 minutes you were gone the area has changed drastically. going back to a T  intersection where there were drops from 6-7 enemies, the drops were gone but there was a road block, a van, a UV trap with a stone vampire. and the two biggest mind-fuzz ever since X-Com, which also was guilty of this: Once enemies lock onto you, they will hit you even from behind cover. So far I've been killed: behind a tree, crouching on a path running at the edge of an (empty) river with rocks, soil and cement between us, and by an enemy who was obviously below ground. as far as I was able to determine, if you can see their !!! or ???, they WILL hit you. and the greatest perverse peeve: use a pistol, the vast majority of drops will be shotgun shells or combat rifle. switch to combat rifle/shotgun and the drops will switch to pistol and sniper rifle. i suspect it will only provide you with a little of your most used ammo to force you to switch. once again as with the resolution, what if I always want to use the same weapon, what's it to the devs? reason to rage quit: the game is online only, even in SP. if your network connection drops, you get booted out to the main menu.

Now, I did not play this game when it was first released so take this positive review with that in mind. I picked this game up for sale when it was $20. I like that is game. I feel like this has a satisfying quirk to it all. The  gun play is average but it ticks it up a notch when you include the different type of vampire mechanics. Your skills come into play when you are forced to handle the vampires. At first just one vampire can be a pain, but soon with better skills and better guns, one vampire becomes a lot easier to deal with. Now, just when you get the hang of one of just one vampire, you start having to handle more and more at one time, or handle different vampire types. Then you again repeat the process of becoming more powerful through better skills and guns and this will allow you to handle vampires better. I think that this is where the game shines. I am having fun running around killing vampires and collecting loot. There are dungeons, a mechanic where the more vampires you kill a gauge will fill up that allows you to take on a powerful vampire that drops better than average loot.

Redfall,1294810,155850340,"Redfall is far from a perfect game. But it has vampires, a decent loot system, and a game that shines beneath its tarnished exterior.

Pros:
+ the art style of Redfall is a MASSIVE relief from ""every game must now be as realistic as possible"" motif many modern games have. If you look at a screenshot of Redfall, you'll know what game it was just from the picture
+ decent loot! The loot is plentiful but never too overwhelming. It's a healthy dose of Borderlands 1-style loot and gun design but never disrespectful of your time a la Destiny 2
+ the atmosphere! The atmosphere is creepy, lonely, and full of Autumn vibes. The world seems empty save for vampires, cultists, and a PMC group in town. It vaguely reminds me of S.T.A.L.K.E.R Anomaly's world map
+ you're never taken out of the story during cutscenes. You're directly involved with the course of the narrative and never treated like an outsider like in BL3
+ killing vampires is always highly satisfying

So-So:
+/- the gunplay isn't as tight as other FPS games but it's certainly come far from where it was before
+/- the empty world can feel too empty with few things to explore but that can be forgiven with deeper exploration and collectables
+/- the side quests are meh, mainly ""fetch this, look for that"" but lore can be found in notes scattered around the world to fill it in
+/- some buildings can feel samey, but can be forgiven if you think about how neighborhoods are constructed with largely similar housing plans
+/- sometimes the AI will stand around, and other times they'll actually try to scout you out. It's a mixed bag

Cons:
- few named locations make looking for things to explore a little boring
- playing solo can be a bit of a rut due to poor balancing
- the balancing is AWFUL. At some points you're 1:1 with your enemies and other times you're 2+:1 in terms of pure damage
- vampires huddling in groups of 3+ will outnumber and kill you extremely quickly
- clunky healing makes healing during combat meh
- ""skill trees"" are boring, uninspired, and not in any way intuitive

The world and locations are well designed and they are quite interesting to explore. There are many classic Arcane signatures you can find here even in the gameplay as well. Locations are designed in such a way to encourage you to use various tactics depending on your abilities or arsenal. 
if you are an Arcane fan, then definitely expect a much simpler and more basic shooter game than what they previously made.

Redfall,1294810,155444871,"So, in all fairness, I do really like this game. But I still have to give it a thumbs down because of the massive amount of things they just refuse to fix. The game has so many problems I can't even list them all. The major problems being: After you complete the story, they wipe your save and start you at the beginning (that alone warrants a thumbs down), game runs on a scaling system with no way to keep your gear relevant other than farming new, which brings up the next problem... Farming for gear is non existent, you do not get drops from vamps except for special vamps, which are very few, hard to find, hard to kill, randomly generated, and drop blue gear at best (usually white or green) in my 45 hours I never once seen a single purple drop from a special vamp. So quite pointless. The game gives you an option that is suppose to be a farming method but this also fails horribly. Unless your playing as the character that has the lightning abilities, running vampire nests is extremely difficult due to the massive amount of vamps and no way to NOT get swarmed (if you could take them out one by one, it would be better), but the real problem with running nests is that you only have 1 minute to try and run around looting as much as you can (which you can't loot much in 1 minute, like 4-6 items). And unless your running the lightning character, it will take you some 20 minutes for a single run. Oh and the rarity of the items is pretty crap in nests too. Making this option completely pointless as well. The only way to get new gear is to check all the supply vendors at safe houses, reload and repeat, which is so very boring. It would be much much more fun to run nests, but you would need to get much better gear and either not have a timer, or increase the timer to 2 minutes. And there are so many other bugs and problems with the game, its not even funny. And considering its been out for over 3 months now, and its in this bad a shape after 3 updates...that is sad and pathetic.

Redfall,1294810,155420805,"This game is really a ""mixed"" bag of stuff.

Arkane Studios that developed games like Prey, Deathloop and the Dishonored series, it creates a high expectations and standards which Redfall sadly does not meet based on those games.
Having said that, I don't feel that Redfall deserves the hate it's given, but at the same time sadly it's understandable.
There is no denying that Redfall has it's bugs, from player characters gliding along/through the floor, player characters that look like they want a hug once loaded into the main base/safe house (I really find that funny), to a random Vampire that's stuck in place and enemies that spawn inside the floor or walls.

The difficulty seems to behave oddly. As 4-players we started on Daylight to find our footing and then changed it to Dusk because Daylight had very little encounters. After the difficulty change the first 2 nights of playing was interesting and felt balanced with the weapon drops and the enemy difficulty, but after that it's been one shot-one kill, even with a pistol. However loading into a single player game with the same difficulty and character used in multiplayer, one is killed by the first vampire encountered outside the safe house.

It is essentially in the same style as games like Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood, Earthfall, Vermintide, Zombie Army and World War Z (minus the 3rd person) but not as chaotic as these.
If you enjoy those type of games it might be worth a try, but get it on sale, I would suggest around 75% off or more, which is when we bought it.

There's a decent amount to explore in Redfall and missions to complete along with side missions and each character has different abilities.

+ Elite vampire gimmick are pretty interesting.

- Occasional framedrop.
- Character customization and build almost nonexistent.

I recommend it only if you can get it on a 75% or higher discount.

I never played this game on launch, only picked it up in Jan/2024 so it's had several large patches. 
The AI is janky at best. They run around and take cover, then attack and then go back to cover in spurts and fits. 
It feels like they had all the proper behaviors programmed into them, just no logic on when to do them.  So instead of procedurally knowing when to take cover, or when to attack... they just kind of randomly pick a behavior or action, and then randomly choose another. 

The graphics are good, they have a nice cartoon style to them. It runs very well. Parts of the game feel like State of Decay. Rescuing civilians, gathering supplies and clearing out the vampire infestation. It's just not as fleshed out as State of Decay by any means... But you get that vibe.  Granted I have only done 2 quests so far. 

Co-op play is fun for the bit of it I have played. Difficulty is not very hard for being set on the hardest difficulty allowed without unlocking ""Eclipse"" mode.  And I should mention I was only playing with one other player. (2 of us in total)  The enemy don't feel too spongy, they just kind of overwhelm you because the Vampires can teleport to you instantly, so you have no way to run away or take cover.

I played Redfall specifically on Game Pass (so as to not lose any money if it turned out to be horrible) and ended up beating the game within 40-hours. When I played the game Arkane had already done two big updates but had not done their most recent one. Almost immediately I could tell there was a pretty decent concept that was Redfall buried underneath a broken (at times) and bland (at times) game. The town of Redfall itself is a lovely setting, lending itself a charming vampire-ridden equivalent to so many New England coastal communities. As a community it can oftentimes feel rather empty and boring but it still nonetheless captured my attention, with all of its beautiful Fall foliage; intriguing locales (like the old whaling museum); and quaint neighborhoods. In terms of gameplay I thought character movement and gunplay felt a bit clunky at times (especially the latter) but still did not quite detract from my enjoyment of the game. Of course the elephant in the room, in my opinion, is the game's stability (or lack thereof in some cases). While it's no doubt gotten better since launch I would say it still runs rather poorly at times. There is still quite a bit of pop-in and if you stand still and watch a particular scene for a few seconds you'll see the on-screen assets struggling to properly render, one moment being in hi-res and the next going to low-res, then back to hi-res (I've played the game on both a 3060 and 4060 on Medium/High/Ultra settings and it always did this. Despite all of this though I still found a fun, somewhat interesting game that managed to keep my attention long enough for me to finish it. I didn't feel the need to find every collectible or clear every single vampire nest, but I still found myself wanting to play the game again just to try new aspects out (like different characters).

Negative:

- Sometimes my character shout out voice lines that would make sense in co-op mode but not in solo mode.

It's disgusting that a [b]trillion[/b] dollar company decided to close this studio over a bad game they didn't even want to make. These major companies worth ridiculous amounts of money are awful for closing studios on a whim. 

Instead of judging this game based on what it should have or should have been, I'm going to review it based on what is actually in the game. I bought this game on sale for about $17. I played the entire game solo. I would absolutely not recommend getting the bite back edition at this point. The new characters haven't been released and all you get are cosmetics. For the price it simply isn't worth it. Also, for just characters I still don't think it's worth it considering how shallow the characters feel that are already in the game. 

For about the first ten hours or so, I actually had a ton of fun with this game. The first area is pretty fun to run around and explore. The gun play is very satisfying. The slide you can do after a big sprint is also a lot of fun because you will slide an obscene distance. The events, missions and encounters are decent enough to be engaging and push the game forward. You can approach some of the missions in different ways such as distant and stealthy, tactical, or guns a blazing. I had a good time experimenting with different approaches to groups of enemies. 

The second area of the game is where things started to run thin. You'll realize at this point that there is very little variety in enemies. In this second area, the enemies are significantly spongier without offering anything significant to reward you for the effort in taking out a challenging enemy. Almost my entire time in the second area was spent avoiding combat as much as possible and when I was detected just running away. Bosses in this part of the game are equally as frustrating and not fun in the slightest to have to deal with. Regular enemies could take me out in a few hits, and to add insult to injury, the AOE of the regular vampire is so huge it is almost impossible to avoid. I can be so far back from a vampire that I could see their entire model and they'd swipe and I'd take 1/3 to 1/2 damage. Not to mention that at this point in the game my guns seemingly barely damaged the vampires unless I could land headshots. 

There's a money system in the game that makes little sense to me. Throughout the world you can find items to pick up that are worth an arbitrary value and you can accrue money. I primarily spent money on reviving after ridiculous deaths, buying ammo, and occasionally lockpicks. There are shops for guns and other things but they never offered anything actually valuable compared to what I would find out while exploring. I never found any significant use for money despite the game giving you tens of thousands of dollars easily. 

I only played as one character. Character's have special abilities that frankly I almost never used because I never saw much of a need for it. The skill tree isn't great. I maxed out the ammo and healing options right away. In my one playthrough I got to level 23 and there were still a lot of skills I had never accessed. There is a NG+ but frankly it would be hard to recommend one playthrough let alone a second. I nearly maxed out one of the skills and when I would remember to use it I never even noticed a difference between the beginning and upgraded versions of the skill. 

I'm not one to jump on a bandwagon and hate on something because it's the thing to do. I gave this game a fair shake. I do think it has some decently fun elements. The gun play is pretty fun. Exploring the environments was interesting because there is some decent environmental story telling. Some of the missions could also be pretty fun as well. What significantly brings this game down, though, is the lack of variety. There are only six weapon types and you're really only going to be using one or two of those once you find the ones you like. The difficulty spike feels unfair or poorly implemented. This is a very under baked product. The ingredients are certainly there for something that could have been quite good. Maybe they can patch this game up and make it a more enjoyable experience in the future? It's hard to say. We'll see. As it is this is technically a functional video game (even with some glitches here or there) but not one that's really worth the time or money.",False,182,1421
Redfall,1294810,154172711,"This game launched a mess. Like a dummy, I bought it day one. Won’t make that mistake again. Well, I set it aside and waited until they did some fixing. Now, after update 3, I’ve restarted the game and I’m loving it. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. Some times (not often) an enemy will sit while you shoot them. I’ve seen some funky glitches like people sliding rather than walking, but it’s not often enough to bother me in the least. I’ve got 22 hours in the game since revisiting it and only one crash. I’ll take that any day.

I think some games just are fun to hate, and once they get on the hate list, it’s really hard to get off. Call of Duty and Madden Football come to mind.  Check out the reviews on MW3, mostly negative. But guess what, it sells like hot cakes and there are a ton of people out there (including myself) that buy it every year and get more than their moneys worth.  But, since it has become cool to hate COD, the reviews are always negative. I think that is what happened to this game. I’d say that it has come far enough that it is worth looking at again. 

Positives: 
Good (not great) graphics.  
Good story. I’ve seen hate on the style of cut scenes (they are voiced stills) but I don’t mind as I’m the type that skips cut scenes anyway.
Nice open world with great atmosphere. 
I’ve yet to see the 2nd map, but I like the first. 
Great audio. 
Neat idea. I’m tired of zombies and Nazis. Vampires is a nice change of pace.
Lots of variety in enemies. There are quite a few different types of vampires.
Nice skill tree.
Co-op. From what I hear it works, but my friends won’t get the game because of all the bad reviews, maybe if it goes on a big sale one day..

Cons:
Game does not tell you how ammo works in the beginning. I thought it was a bug (and it may be), but until the mission where you steal a supply crate from the Bellweather guys and open up a safe house, I was unable to purchase ammo. This forced me to rely on picked up ammo, and you almost never (at least in the beginning) get ammo for the UV gun or the stake gun. This makes it really hard to take out vampires in the beginning. The ammo in your main base (the firehouse) still does not work for me. I almost quit the game because of this. But my work around now is to just buy the ammo from a safe house and it works.

Heroes are unbalanced for solo play. Tip here, play as Remi. The rest just don’t do well solo. Until switching to Remi, I considered quitting as I could not beat massed vampires, which will happen. I do think the Hero mix would work well in Co-op.

Ok now for some fun. I often see reviews on Steam that are obviously designed more to get likes and awards than actually provide a useful review. I’m going to toss in my favorites; maybe I’ll get some awards as well!

1. Nobody reads reviews, so I’ll just say I’m gay.
2. I’m paralyzed from the waist down (no disrespect to those who really are). This game allowed me to finally get to know my son. We play it together and have grown closer than we ever were before, because, you know, I’m not very good at outdoor sports.
3. And my personal favorite: I pledge to swallow 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise for each like that I get for this review.

Just skip this game or get it somewhere for 10$, i got it for 15$ during sale and that was a good bargain imo.

Gameplay is standard FPS, with not that good feeling to it. There are no  throwable objects in game, unless you pick certain characters. Its weird for me not to have some kind of grenade or other throwable in FPS game.
AI is broken and sometimes non existant....enemies will get stuck or they will fail to react to their friend being slaughtered in front of them. Vamps are nothing but common enemies with beefier hp and dmg. Unless you fight with special Vamps ( which are usually mini bosses)  They are OK at best.
Performance is something they could work on, while i got average fps around  60  most of the time, i did got stutters ,usually while sprinting.

When the game first came out, the general opinion on the game was that it was simply underbaked, felt empty, ran poorly, lacked enough substance to the gameplay to keep you engaged for a full 12 hours (as my playthrough took).
So with the updates that have come out since launch, is the game now worth a playthrough?

YES, and here are my reasons;
-Added new community standing system, rewarding you for both collecting massive amounts of loot and complete side objectives as you come across them. Among the upgrades is one that shows grave locks on the map when your close enough to them, making the arduous process of collecting them so much easier and less taxing.
-Optimized the game, making it so that it actually runs smoothly, even on the highest graphic settings possible.
-Fixed numerous bugs, making it easier for you to stay engaged to the game.

Redfall,1294810,153328915,"Red Fall is an excellent game that I highly recommend to anyone looking for an immersive and engaging gaming experience. The graphics are outstanding, and I love the style of the art. The game runs seamlessly on my PC, with no hiccups of any kind, and the FPS is excellent on my 1440p monitor. 

The combat system in Red Fall is top-notch, and the weapons feel fantastic. The game does an excellent job of making you feel like a badass, whether you're taking out enemies with an assault rifle or a shotgun. 

One thing I appreciate about Red Fall is that the ammo situation isn't as bad as some people claim it to be. You can buy ammo and get money pretty quickly, and you can find ammo in the world as well. This makes for a more balanced gameplay experience, where you're not constantly worrying about running out of ammunition.

However, I do feel that the game is too easy, even when playing on the Midnight difficulty level. While the combat is incredibly satisfying, I would have liked to see a bit more challenge in the game. Perhaps adding more difficult enemies or increasing the number of enemies in each encounter could help to amp up the difficulty and make the game more engaging.

Overall, Red Fall is a fantastic game that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun and engaging shooter experience. The graphics are stunning, the combat is satisfying, and the gameplay is well-balanced. While the game may be a bit too easy for some players, it's still a joy to play and provides hours of entertainment.

This is the first Arkane game I won't bother to 100%. I am probably one of the biggest Arkane fans; I adore that studio, but the last games released were underwhelming.

Deathloop had a sloppy story. Your character had no weight; you constantly felt like you were floating. Your weapons had no weight; you had nothing going for you. Even systems that they created and mastered for Dishonored fell flat in Deathloop.

Redfall is the culmination of the failures of Deathloop and Arkane. That's making me extraordinarily sad. Like in Deathloop, you have no weight. You feel very floaty. My first playthrough was on Hard. I chose to play as Remi. While Remi is a support character, she felt like the best option to play as, offering staggers and movement options on top of sustain. This brings me to the next point that combat is incredibly boring and stagnant. You get your human enemies who usually die in one or two shots; the vampires are bullet sponges. The special vampires aren't really stronger than the regular ones, just more annoying. And the weapons felt kinda... eh.

The story, once again, fell completely flat.

All in all, I can imagine this game being more fun with a duo, not because the combat becomes more fun or anything, but simply because you have something to actually do while you get your 15th ""go here, kill bad guy, come back"" quest.

Redfall,1294810,153047669,"To recommend, or not to recommend?
I think two things killed the goodwill this game may have otherwise received:

1 - The price. At $70, it's a hard no. At $20 - $30, it's fine.

2 - It was basically marketed as ""Dead Island with Vampires instead of zombies."" I.e. a co-op shooter for up to 4 players, with quests and different characters with individual skill trees.
Had they marketed it as ""a single-player experience with some broken co-op elements"" (i.e. ""Far Cry""), people would have known what to expect.

As Vampire Far Cry, I enjoyed it immensely -- the core loop is spot on. The guns feel good, and each type feels necessary. This isn't a ""one gun fits all"" game where you find your favourite gun and then never shoot anything else; it's a game where all types (sniper rifle, AR, shotgun, and yes, stake launcher and UV gun) feel like useful arrows to come out of the quiver depending on the situation -- and not begrudgingly, either. Almost all buildings can be scaled, at least by the two characters with powerjump / teleport skills, enabling dynamic escapes and a lot of sniping from the rooftops, and both stealthy methodical and ""guns blazing"" approaches.

Redfall suffers from many odd decisions -- the characters look ugly, the cut scenes are slide shows, and friendly NPCs receive very little writing or flavour lines. There are two very unnecessary points of no return -- once in the second map, you cannot return to the starter area, and after completing the main quest, you are evicted from the open world altogether (perchance to return in New Game+). Like the writing of the allies, the story is somewhat basic (and the latter may also have worked better had they picked one of ""sciencey vampires"" and ""fantasy vampires"", rather than mixing the two). Perhaps this is intentional, to keep you in the fight rather than in the hub, and as such, it works.
On the plus side, this also means we're not bothered with yet another crafting system, and there never is any real inventory pressure. Additionally, once you know what you like, there is no lengthy deliberation which guns to sell and which to keep. For once, we spend our time playing, rather than running chores!

I can't speak to the co-op experience; there is no match-making, and the reddit groups and discord servers I found seem inactive by now (Dec 2023). The whole ""progress only registers for the session host"" thing sounds incredibly broken regardless.

Addendum: Played on Linux, zero issues.

Verdict

If you're looking for a co-op experience, skip.
If single-player ""Vampire Far Cry"" sounds good and you can pick it up for about $25, give it a go.

Redfall,1294810,152931502,"Redfall is, for all intents and purposes, a game without a purpose designed by committee. It is hard to believe anyone had any creative vision that was poured into this playable nothingness.

Its threadbare story serves only to connect playable point A to point B. It has little dramatic arc, as its main characters are not personally invested in what's happening, even though voice acting might melodramatically try to convince one otherwise, as a character's voice cracks while describing events that could pretend to rattle a bleeding heart teenager. The truth is that playable characters have only the barest of connections to the game's plot: they stand to gain nothing, are there out of literal obligation, and do not change or explore any aspects of their personality through the course of the game. Secondary characters, though more involved in the town's tribulations, are too absent to develop anything but suggestions of a personality, and, compelling as some of these might be, they are given so little breathing room that they, more often than not, amount to nothing.

When one is out in the world, they might run into enemy humans or vampires: humans pose little to no challenge, as most die with one or two shots to the head, and do not move around enough to make this task difficult. Vampires have more resilience, and have to be finished off either with a stake, fire, lightning, or UV lights. Most will try to rush the player, and can deal decent damage up-close, making encounters with them a little more engaging once they come in larger numbers. There are a few special types of vampires, but these rarely force the player to change their tactics around, safe for one who creates an area of limited visibility around the player, and tries to flee while throwing projectiles, forcing the player to switch roles and give chase, and one who has rotating shields, forcing the player to be more precise in aiming, lest they waste their (frankly abundant) resources.

These encounters run out of steam rather fast, as the game fails to throw any further curveballs down the line, and encounters increasingly become annoyances that serve only to interrupt the pace. The other side of the game is exploration, but the game very much discourages it. The only thing of value to find in its world are safehouses and historical markers, both of which are already marked on the player's map, so they might make a  beeline for them immediately. Once a mission is started, it, too, is marked on your map and one is given very little reason to take any detours. 

The only thing one might find in active exploration is ammunition and healthpacks, both of which can be replenished at one of the safehouses that dot the map anyway for very little in exchange, dry notes left behind by the unseen inhabitants of Redfall that fail to either add texture or suggest a sense of loss, or guns than more often than not are worse than anything you might be carrying. Should one try to ignore markers and objectives, they will find themselves at a loss, since there is very little visually distinct about Redfall that might orient the player to anything interesting, and objectives sometimes give so little direction, that one is forced to rely on markers anyway.

I can think of very few reasons to play Redfall. It adds nothing to anything, everything it does, others do better. It serves only to spend (or more accurately, waste) time, it has nothing to say for itself, nothing distinct about its story, gameplay, or visuals.

Redfall,1294810,152842557,"I wanted to play this game for a long time but first time the performance on the 3070 was rough but after some time playing other games decided to get and play the game. The performance went wayyy up. 

So deff looking out to Playing this game, i know it has some bad reviews but visuals look decent. 

Cant be that bad comming from Bethesda RIGHT.  Anyway ill find out one way.",True,2,529
Redfall,1294810,152839257,"Even after the much belated 1.03 update Redfall is still utterly pointless.  The AI is braindead, the missions are uninspired and boring, the open world is virtually empty of anything actually happening, the player characters are dull, the ""cutscenes"" are laughable and ultimately the game is plain bad.  This is a title where every single narrative point is delivered either by still images using the in the game render or artwork.  Echoes of the past are narrative dumps that are also barely animated with the characters being made of glowing circulatory systems awkwardly moving.  The problem during these scenes is that you don't know who is who and worse some of them have to play to completion before allowing progress to the next area, and these can last a few minutes at times so strap in folks.

The world I found was quite good from a visual design perspective, I knew what area I was in from the look of the surroundings easy enough and each area had its own unique style.  The massive downside is the near complete lack of any kind of life in the map.  It has no dynamic events or wandering enemy parties to encounter for instance or special events.  Most if not all of the games enemies are locked to their spawns and will only react when engaged meaning you can easily pick them off one by one from a distance and sometimes not even receive return fire.

Opening up safe houses is supposed to be a way to represent your push back against the vamps but it doesn't really visually do much.  Outside of adding some homeless people to the safe house it is hard to see that you have secured the territory.  Safe house gameplay works in exactly the same way each time.  Go to location and shoot cultists.  Congrats you now have access to a shop that sells lock picks and hacking devices.  Next step, defeat the vampire underboss.  Sounds cool but what does that entail?  Go to location and shoot cultists with a vampire at the end bish bash bosh you have secured the territory.  Not that you will notice since cultists and vampires will still roam the area regardless and the good people of Redfall will still hide in the safe house.

Enemy variety is pish poor as well.  Human cultist enemies come in the single variety of gun toting lobotomy patient who have zero awareness of their environment.  They worship different vampire gods but they have no variation between them.  So the bloody tom cultists and miss whisper cultists just have slightly different masks and no other distinguishing element to them.  Bellweather mercenaries are much the same outside of one deploying a turret.  Human foes are just terrible and have no challenge to them at all.  Vampires are pretty bad as well since your normal vamps just run at you and slash forwards.  Sidestepping can easily defeat a creature of the night and they do little else of note before being staked.  The three other vampires in the form of the shroud, siphon and angler all at least do something different during combat.  Shrouds produce darkness that forces you into a haze that obscures them until you get closer allowing her and her minions to hit you more.  Siphons steal health during combat and anglers can grab you and bite you for big damage.

The big downside of these three is that they are all pretty formulaic despite the different abilities they use and hilariously all of them can be killed instantly with a stake launcher to any part of their body.  They are supposed to drop loot upon defeat but nearly always drop wedding rings which are just currency items and when they do drop guns they tend to be of the low quality type so fighting them just becomes as perfunctory as the regular vampires sadly.  It is a shame here because these three show Arkane Austin had some good ideas for these enemies but they just become another regular enemy to thrash your way through.


Technically it works in as much as it won't crash to desktop or have severe performance issues but so does desert bus and you don't see droves of people running off to play that.  I know Redfall had little support during development and I feel for the team who knew they were making a digital stinker of a product but it doesn't excuse the end product.  The bugs are funny to witness like Vampires getting stuck on the environment and still yacking at you about how superior they are.  Human enemies will pop into existence ahead of you and then begin to patrol a five foot square before you kill them.  I stumbled across numerous captives who were being held by literally no one but they kept spouting lines about rescuing them from their captors and look out for the cultists.  Freeing them does nothing by the way, they just run off and you get very little if any reward.  Animations even get the stinkier end of the stick with some weapons like sniper rifles that have hovering magazines that float into the gun while you use the force to load them.  

Enemies in buildings will be completely oblivious to your run and gunning if they are on the second floor while you stake and gun down their buddies downstairs.  It completely undermines the atmosphere because the enemies are so dense.  The bosses are crap to fight.  They are built up with names like ""Miss Whisper"" and ""Bloody Tom"" but the fights just end up being a bullet sponge boss with extremely basic attack patterns in arena's that have abundant resources to keep you armed and healthy so there is zero threat or chance of failure.

This is meant to be a looter shooter in the same vein as games like Borderlands but enemies drop very rarely and when they do the weapons are always low tier trash you won't keep and just end up buying better quality stuff from the base vendor.  You only get the really good stuff from the supposedly dreaded Rook enemy.  After you kill enough vampires the Rook will eventually appear and then rush you like any other random vamp.  He has zero unique abilities or skills outside of being able to teleport away briefly which always has him just popping back in to run at you more.  Killing him will nearly always reward you with a gold quality unique weapon and these are the best guns in the game.  

Nests are supposed to be where you go for the real challenge and potential loot bonanza but they are just tepid rehashed areas of the map stitched together to form basic procedural levels.  Vampires can be completely ignored in these as you speedrun to the finish, break out the trapped souls who maintain the nest and then gobble up loot before it collapses.  After clearing about ten of these nests not a single gold dropped.  It doesn't help that when you do get the chance to loot hoover the nest has roughly sixty seconds before it closes giving you barely anytime to find all the loot drops.

Oh the guns also suck in visual variety as well.  You will see the same rifle, shotgun, pistol and SMG just with slightly different names as you play but honestly the number of ""Grackle"" pistols you discover will fast become old.  At least other looter games will have a lot of loot to collect and it be distinct enough to be interesting to look at, this game cycles at a guess from my time playing from start to finish around a dozen common models for the weapons.  Special weapons like flare guns, UV beam emitters and stake launchers are all the same model and have either limited ammo or feck all damage that you will ignore most of them to carry an extra shotgun or rifle to have quick access to a bayonet for quicker stabbage of vampires.

Overall Redfall is not worth buying, not even on a massive discount.  Cooperative doesn't help alleviate the issues at all other than to share the pain with someone.  The best thing I can say about the game is that it has a nice shade of red for the title and you could maybe gift it to someone you really dislike.",False,8,1028

Sadly, none of that happened. Instead it gets judged as an AAA game because that is how they chose to price it, and if you pay full price for an AAA title you expect a level of polish that Redfall in NO WAY delivered on release, and doesn't really deliver even now. Releasing it when they did, and how they did, at the price they did, was a massive mistake on somebody's part somewhere up the corporate ladder, and I hope they at least realize how dumb they were.

If you can get the game for less than 20 bucks, and you like open world looter shooters with mostly boring loot and average shooting (and a pretty small open world, considering) than sure, pick it up I guess. If it's more than $20.00, that's a hard pass. Even being largely bug free at this point (half a year later) it's STILL not worth more than that.

Lots of jump scares, a diversity of weapons and enemies, a pretty cool skill set and progression, a robust city to explore (and I've not yet opened the larger map), and so on.

On normal difficulty at least, you thankfully don't lose everything on your multitude of deaths and some degree of your mission progress is preserved (although human NPCs repopulate the area of operation once you respawn and return). It's no ""Jogging Simulator 2.0"" (see e.g., un-modded Arma 2 and 3)  thanks to a number of fast travel locations you can open up as you progress.

Redfall,1294810,152491480,"I'm about a third or so way through the game (from what I gathered). Redfall isn't by any means a great game, but I have still been enjoying it. The concept and story is interesting. The gunplay is fun, although not too in-depth. I think exploring is better than some open world games. Not that there are a ton of sidequests or ambient things going on in the world, but the world at least isn't so huge that you feel like you're wasting time just getting from point A to B, something that seems to be a problem with some recent open world games. So I appreciate the developers keeping the open world more concise and to scale with the amount of content.

Performance-wise I haven't had any issues. It's been running pretty smoothly on both my 3080 and 3060-Mobile. Which is welcome considering how poorly optimized many new releases have been.

I didn't play the game when it came out, the third major patch was released when I did. It sounds like it was a lot more buggy and less optimized when it released, so I never had to deal with that. I bought it on heavy discount at 75% off. I didn't have high expectations going in due to all the negative press and reviews. All of those which I am sure influenced my expectations going in verses someone who paid 70 or 100 USD on launch.

While I enjoy the game in general for what it is, there are still some areas that could be improved or added to greatly improve the game in my opinion with potential future patches or content updates.

 - Improve the enemy AI. It's... serviceable, but  feels pretty basic and unintelligent for a modern game. Sometimes the AI is alright, but it feels like most of the human enemies mostly will just move and shoot in one place at you. Enemies sometimes get stuck behind walls or act reckless to the point where it seems like they are just suicidal. The vampire enemies are a bit more engaging, but still seem like they need some work. I think the game tries to offset some of the shortcoming of the AI with having them do more damage to you, so you can easily die if you are reckless or aren't paying attention, but the AI is still often questionable enough that it's noticeable.

- Better develop solo play: 

This game should be able to played offline if you are playing solo. Being able to play offline would make this game a lot more attractive to Steam Deck owners and people interested in Modding. 

Also, allow manual saves, pausing, more tweaks to the difficulty. Make the game more open and easy to mod. I think these may give the game a bit more replayability and more of a better experience if you play the game solo. If the game was as flexible and open as a Bethesda-developed game I can see potential there. (Bethesda was the publisher of this game, not the developer)

- Make more ambient quests and activities, and more side quests and lore. I think the game has an interesting setting and more stories and things happening in the world could help show that.

- It'd be nice if there were ways to manually upgrade or mod your weapons, instead of having to just scrap them after leveling up a bit. Adding modification may be a bit much at this point, but maybe add a way to upgrade a weapon's level, even if it is expensive.

- [spoiler] Ability to go back to the first map after the point of no return shortly after defeating the Hollow Man [/spoiler]

- Add melee weapons

- Allow the player to assign more than one keyboard or mouse button to an action. Such as the bash key - It'd be nice if I can have it assigned as a keyboard key and a mouse key. Currently it's just one or the other.

Overall Redfall seems like it has the beginnings of a good and interesting game, but was released too early. Another year of polish and rounding out of content and gameplay features and AI would have helped a lot and probably would have delivered a good game. At this point Redfall I think is playable and enjoyable enough (to me), but it does feel pretty mid and like a lot of wasted potential. It would be cool to see some content releases that improve the game, but I find it hard to see Akane/Bethesda committing more  than they already promised considering the game doesn't appear to be selling well or have a lot of people playing it.

Overall: I wouldn't pick up the game for full price right now, but for a very good discount I think it's worth a try. I think it's much better than its reputation has been portrayed online at least, so I wouldn't judge the game just off that. I've played games that I've paid for that I feel were genuinely much worse; but that's me. It should have retailed for probably half the price.

-Improve human AI 
-Balance enemy damage, you take a stupid amount of damage and it can feel unfair
-Add solo mode with checkpoints 
-Add friendly AI on the map to make it feel more alive
-Tweak the load out system, you get a lot of gun so often that it becomes confusing to know what to use

Pros (SOLO playthrough):
- Runs VERY well on my old 6-th gen Intel together with Nvidia 3080
- excellent, satisfying sound effects
- Good visual design and graphics
- Excelent, satisfying gunplay
- Many different playstyles available

Cons (SOLO playthrough):

- Mid-part of game is somewhat boring (some grinding)
- Didn't engage me sufficiently to consider additional play-throughs, for now.

- Some balancing issues

- Arkane games do not excel at elaborate story-telling, but they normally have an excellent plot at their core - Redfall does not

Pros
+ Map is super fun to explore, I really enjoy the town settings and urban atmosphere.
+ Gunplay is fantastic
+ Leveling up and getting new loot is enjoyable.
+ Minimal to zero bugs so far.
+ Performance has been great. 120FPS, 4k Ultra with DLSS3 with a 4070ti.
+ Leveling up with new weapons and equipment.

Mid:
- Lack of crafting would make this game better.
- Wish there was more areas/houses/places to explore
- Loot could be much better and more beneficial. The money system doesn't work super well.. You buy ammo and maybe a random gun once in a while. Kinda pointless.
- Wish there were bases you could setup better with users.
- Zero reason to hang onto a weapon once you level up.

Cons:
- No pause menu is INCREDIBLY frustrating.
- Saving system is kinda weird.

The guns feel alright and are pretty accurate, the scaling is way off though. Too often you go from one-shotting everything to not dealing any damage. The sniper constantly sways for some reason. Instead of recoil guns (apart from the sniper rifle) don`t deal any damage at longer ranges.
The AI is fucking retarded.
The human enemies run up to you in a straight line and die way too easily. The vampire enemies just rush you relentlessly until their pathfinding breaks.
If you want to buy/unlock/hack/salvage anything or save survivors you have to hold ""E"" for an abhorrent amount of time.
If you are playing with a mate, get ready for them to constantly be T-posing and bobbing in the ground. For some reason your mate has a shadow, but you don`t. The connection was stable at least in my experience.
The missions can be completed super quickly and the game often feels like a walking simulator. There are barely any enemies for one person, so sometimes you don`t even get to shoot anything.
The graphic settings are useless. The game looks and runs like shit regardless of what you pick. I had screen tearing issues and my mate had FPS drops, even though we have the same beefy setup. Textures looked mushy and washed out, especially at a distance. The low draw distance meant enemies sometimes just disappeared out of view. 

Even after half a year this game is still an unfunny joke.
The heads of Arkane Austin should be ashamed. I would rather be known as the village idiot than be associated with such a dogshit travesty.

First of all play this game as solo (fun factor maximized)
ai is intelligent, its hard and intense and environment and sound makes you feel like in horror. You die most of the times because ai attacks you as a group (human slaves and vampires). Every vampire nest is different. Game is repetitive but because of the sound and different environments to explore each time makes it interesting. This is the best looting game of 2023. looting is like borderlands zillion of guns and items you find in the game. when you level up you should find or buy leveled up weapon for your mission to fight good. all characters has 3 abilities to grow like the guy I play has cloak like Crysis game. Crow scan like it scans and shows enemies through walls for a limited time and a special gun move. You have limited ammo so you have to fight and when all finished you have to start to run. When running from an enemy, They follow you all the way till you dead or hide good, health packs are limited. I enjoyed the game too much and now at my 11th hour in that game for 2nd day.

I was playing with a friend as host for a substantial amount of hours. Next day we both logged in to resume game and found out none of our progress in levels and equipment had saved for him. Meaning he was 7 levels below me. Making continuation in co op impossible.

This is a well documented bug after searching google. And yet Arkane still has not addressed this major game breaking bug and instead focuses on basic game play improvements.

Redfall is plagued by a lack of basic features that are essential for any video game. The narrative is virtually non-existent. It fails to deliver on the promise of an immersive experience in every way possible.

While the gunplay manages to be enjoyable and responsive, the overall gaming experience is marred by poorly executed combat encounters. The AI, in particular, is the worst AI I have ever experienced in my life, in a video game. Constant glitches, awkward t-poses, erratic behavior and other bugs are not even the main issue. The main issue is core programming of the AI. The coding is uninspired and lazy, showcasing a lack of imagination and a fundamental misunderstanding of what makes games truly enjoyable.

Even if the developers miraculously fix the AI issues, fill the game with content, and make it feature-complete, Redfall would still a below average gaming experience. It falls short of the entertainment value expected from games, turning each session into a laborious task that made me feel bored, frustrated, and ultimately disappointed.

Even at a discounted price, Redfall makes me feel like I got ripped-off. The game fails to fulfill its primary purpose – providing entertainment. The initial excitement fades quickly, transforming every gaming session into a disheartening experience.

Just to be clear, its not great, its not nearly as good as Prey, Wolfenstein etc, but its the most fun ""post apocalyptic survival fps"" Ive played, and at ~$15 its great value.

Basically its an open world vampire/military first person action RPG. Guns feel pretty good to shoot, enemy AI is a bit dumb but its OK enough to have fun, you can scavenge a bunch of stuff - what more do people want?! (Oh wait, after playing a bit more, I have more on this later).

Music is fine, as is the voice acting, character models, animation, etc - it would obviously be better if this was all outstanding, but oh well.

It very much has an Arkane game feel (think Dishonoured2) - but not as good as their normal stuff.

3 weapons to hotkey between isnt enough - 5 would be good, and 10 even better. Im using a keyboard Arkane!

You cant return to areas after moving onto the next area? And There are gravelocks (secret-ish collectibles) to collect? Wow, that design decision sucks.

PS - Im playing solo, but playing with some friends would be even more fun.

I might be a complete dummy, but I dont know how to host a game with random people dropping in... this is a thing right? OMG, no its not. OK, so this is why Redfall flopped! Its a perfectly fine single player FPS action RPG (at a $15 price point), not as good as Arkanes previous games, but its OK. It requires an always online connection, and you cant pause the game which is obviously complete faeces. But thats because its not really supposed to be a single player game right, its supposed to be an open world action RPG version of left for dead. But There isnt the ability to team up with random ppl, you need to host a game, invite friends (friends only?!) then and there as there is no drop-in drop-out functionality - so as a multiplayer coop game its completely nerfed and has zero chance of being successful.  Arkane should work to add in 1/ the ability to team up with random people, and 2/ drop in, drop out, this is the critical functionality they need to have so this stands a chance of success (see Generation Zero for a comparison).

Edit: I think Ive figured out what may make people think this game is jank, and thats the music in the fire station/hideouts - it is *complete* jank, this carefree piano and hip hop tune that says ""you dont have a care in the world and everything is even kinda cool"". It completely sets the wrong mood, and subconsciously contaminates the rest of the game. I dont recall hearing any good music yet either (and never ever discount how important music is for setting the feel of a game), so I will shortly turn off the music entirely, and listen to something which I think would suit better.

Edit2: Im got to area 2, and ennui set in. Im bored. I dont think I'll continue this unless it becomes more fun to play. Could be more fun if they make it into a decent SP game. Could be more fun if it gets drop in MP. As it is, Ive had enough.

That aside, I would be probably a lot more unhappy with the game if I had paid full box price for it.

Offing a vampire with a shotgun to the face followed up by  a stake to the heart can make you feel like a regular little Buffy. Poking around the town of Redfall is good fun although despite it being populated by the undead it can feel a little lifeless (!). 

The tone is mixed, and this can break the immersion. Your out of place character quips grate - and the AI for the cultist/soldier enemies is so shaky its like shooting fish in a barrel. If the devs had sharpened up the ai more and leaned into the horror this could have been something special.

It's ok solo, probably more fun with others - assuming of course you can convince anyone else to play it.

This is not Arkanes' best work (actually it's at the bottom of pile). Get it on sale, ignore the 'bite back' upgrade, and pretend Arkane didn't make it - then it doesn't feel quite as bad.

It has severe balancing issues. They never should have mixed group playing with solo playing. Either the game is too easy to groups or too hard for solo players.

If you are a solo player the game is practically unplayable. Example: I left the firehouse and turned right. A short distance from the firehouse I ended up fighting about 5 vampires as a level 2 character with appropriate weapons for my level. I only lasted a short time. A group probably could have handled them but a low-level solo player it was impossible.

Though, I don't think this game is worth 70 bucks. Wait for a sale. Sometimes it's on sale for more than half off.

So let's get the cons out of the way first:
- Visual story telling isn't that interesting so far. Arkane is fantastic at story-telling in their environments and notes. And this game does have moments of decent visual story telling. But most of it so far is a mostly un-touched looking town with notes where most of them don't say much interesting.
- Not a lot of creativity in gameplay. Arkane has always encouraged different approaches in their levels, combat, and stealth, for maximum creativity and experimentation/discovery. But due to the multiple characters and open world, your abilities aren't that wide in variety, and the levels aren't that tight in design compared to their other titles.
- Vampires are a mixed bag when fighting. On one hand, they're dangerous and cool looking. On the other, they have lunges I can't seem to dodge, and they swarm around you up close, so it's not easy to handle more than two in a not-fun way. Maybe that'll get better as I get more skills and better gear. And they don't leave during the day too (for explained reasons).

Now for the pros:
- Fantastic atmosphere and setting. Despite the lack of story-telling in the untouched looking town, it helps make it look pretty and has a nice small town feel to its setting and atmospheric direction, and just has a lot of personality in general. Helps you imagine living a life there before its recent disaster. Kinda like Everybody's gone to Rapture, just Halloween. And that's not even considering the crazy visuals in the environmental/level art during the story.
- VERY satisfying gunplay. Although abilities are more limited compared to previous titles, the feedback in the sound and reaction for shooting enemies always feels GOOD!
- Unique approach for an Akrane game. You could definitely tell they were warming up to something like this with the invasion mechanic in Deathloop (a really good game, btw!) But this is a full 4-player co-op, open world. I've only played solo, and the open world stuff isn't as tight or well designed as their previous games.

But my friend and I paid 70 for it and decided we'd co-op and get our moneys worth. We had a co-op bug right off the bat where if a person doesnt play it before co-oping and just joins your game their level and equipment progress is lost, which was... bad. But if you play a bit before joining another persons game that clears up. So, a little bumpy to start.

But once you get past a some of that its pretty impressive. The setting, the location... reminds me of The Secret World's first location. Sea side east coast stuff with utterly ruined residence with personality, the setting is awesome. The vampires are really creepy and you can hear them whispering and sneaking about, the solo playing and team plate are completely different experiences and it takes a while to really get used to the game. My friend and I have gotten jumped by too many vampires at once and died many a time and it was pretty fun because eventually we started -not- dying against them. And again, the location, the scenery, the graphics (Doctor Venture's voice actor snuck in there kind of surprised me and.. creeped me out a bit). Im still working through it with my friend and enjoying reading the little bits of lore, learning the rules of the vampires and how they got there and their backstories and just absolutely ruining them. Its an expereince. The character dialogue is entertaining and when you co-op they occasionally have exchanges and talk about stuff and make jokes.

Would recommend... maybe a bit later when its on sale, in a year, when perhaps they clean up a few more of the bugs too. But really rich game. Just one of the sort you should catch a year later after some effort got put into making it more sleak.",True,11,3214

The update hath come, and while the game remains far from perfect, I'm still enjoying it.  My biggest beef is that it feels deeply imbalanced on solo play. Sometimes I'm hit with a bajillion vampires and I die right away. Other times, most of the city is empty.

Still, I AM really enjoying it, and I keep opening it up to play for 1-2 hours each day. It has VIBES and that's one of my favorite aspect of all Arkane Games: the vibes. I absolutely love the way they build their worlds.  Prey + Dishonored 2 + Deathloop are my top 5 games of all time. No, I've not yet encountered a mission with the mindblowing level design of Dishonored 2 or the absurd fun of Deathloop or the sheer terror of Prey...

But I keep playing Redfall and having a lot of fun. Plus, I'm genuinely hopeful that Arkane Studios really will keep adding to this and improving it. I love what they do; I know there was a lot crap behind the scenes that left this game falling short; as an author who exists at the whim of her publisher, I get it. Viscerally.

Redfall,1294810,148059691,"At time of writing this i have just over 10 hours on the game. i played this game when it first came out, i was hyped for it and was excited to play... but it was actual dog water. i payed 70$ for it and returned it after only around 30 min, as it was unplayable with frame rate issues and lagging while playing co-op. I was very disappointed, the game felt empty and just not finished. I saw that update 2 came out and wanted to give it a try to see if it was savable so I got it on sale... and I will tell you, this game is actually pretty fun now. I'm about half way done the game going for 100% and enjoying it quite a bit. Don't get me wrong the game still has issues but it is definitely much better and shouldn't get so much hate. 


Need to do with game:

Fix ai still - When sniping ai they stand around when one of them have been shot, they need to become more alert, actively take cover and search for you better.

Vampire nests - These are fine and all but they should be limited and not respawn as you destroy them, maybe keep one somewhere on the map after completing them all for replayability. Also why not throw a achievement in there for taking them all out.

Vampire combat - Vampires definitely feel much stronger then your normal enemy but sometimes they are just boring, they run at you, swing, sometimes teleport away, and repeat. definitely could use some improvements.

Weapons - There's definitely a lack of weapon variety with limited customization. modifying attachments, a gun store, etc, would be nice

Inventory - This isn't all to bad but an ability to lock some of your weapons so you don't get them mixed up with all the guns you just looted would help, there's times I scraped the wrong gun just to find out it was my best gun.

Skills - Skills are pretty decent with neat ability's but the leveling system feels slow, I'm level 13 after completing half the game and still need so many skill points. a few more skills would also be nice. like carrying capacity for med kits and even inventory space for guns.

Safe-houses - These are lacking heavily, run past enemy's, turn on a generator, repeat. a more outpost feel would be nice with them enclosed with walls or something. A more of a far cry outpost feel like having to eliminate all the enemy's would definitely add more to the game.

Trapped souls - This isn't a bad concept just a bit annoying. I've ran around the map and destroyed them all, and they just respawn, its quite annoying, making them disappear forever when they are destroyed would be good, and you could even add a achievement for it.

The fire station - This could have had a better execution with features like missions for upgrading the base, and even base defense mechanics just to add more replayability and excitement.

Overall as of the current state of them game i'd give it a solid 7.5/10 and worth around 45$. For what it is, its a valid game, I enjoy it a lot but it definitely could have been executed better and thats sad to see. I really hope a Redfall 2 comes out and it can be what Redfall was supposed to.
",True,22,734
Redfall,1294810,148033683,"Honestly I don't understand the hate. I played it for free on gamepass just to see what was up and I actually enjoyed it so I bought it on steam. It may not be a game for everyone and thats fine but I don't see why it has so many negative reviews. Ive had a lot of fun just sneaking by or obliterating vampires and cultists. Its basically vampire dishonored. If you like the dishonored franchise give it a go. If you are unsure of spending the $70 try it on xbox gamepass. But dont let the reviews persuade you like I did at first.

Update: So since I finished it I figured i'd post an update. I still stand by what I said. I enjoyed the game. Throughout the entire game I never had a crash or any major bug. Occasionally the menu would glitch but swapping tabs fixed it. Could it use some more to the game overall? Absolutely, it was pretty repetitive but still had its fun. Could have used more story and missions.  Beat it in a little over 20 hours. Doing most missions (probably missed one or two side missions).

 The Vampire nests didnt really seem to have a point other than some chances at good loot and money and just something else to do, overall pretty underwhelming. They made a bubble in that area that made vamps stronger but they didnt serve a purpose otherwise and didnt effect the completion of the game. The little red gas bodies on the map seemed to randomly respawn so clearing them was kind of a waste of time imo. 

Downsides: Make sure you finish everything you want to do in Redfall before going to Burial Point because there is no backtracking that I found once you go to the next area. So if you miss anything you have to wait until the next play through. Also once you beat the game theres no ""cleanup"" for anything you missed. Thats the game and when you click play again it starts you over but you keep your weapons and all the gravelocks and stuff you found in your previous play through. 

Im not sure theres Gold snipers, stake guns, or UV lights because my entire plathrough I kept getting the same variety of guns so it does seem like its very limited on gold tier weapons which cant have their skin changed or stake changed which was kind of a bummer. The only way it seems to get gold guns is to hit the randomizer in the ""gun shop"" and hope for luck or kill the Rook which is like a mini boss that spawns after you kill enough vamps and always guarantees a gold weapon. Other than that I never saw a gold weapon from looting.

10May24 - Changing my review to negative since theres no hope on this game ever getting updates or fixed now that the studio was axed. There was a lot of potential here. just need more time and love to it imo. And chances that no offline mode coming means there wont be more playability once the servers get axed too. Its too bad.

Having spent three hours in the game, I can confidently say that it has been an enjoyable experience so far. The storyline has piqued my curiosity, and the weapons pack a punch both in terms of feel and sound. The game’s textures are of superior quality, with VRAM usage hovering around 11+ GB at 4K FSR2 Quality. Even with maxed-out details and Reshade Pathtracing enabled, I’m getting a steady 50 fps, which is quite satisfactory for me.

I would advise potential players not to be swayed by the Steam reviews. They seem to have triggered a negative chain reaction, with many people blindly following the opinions of certain reviewers or YouTubers. I encourage you to try the game for yourself. It retains the signature Arkane DNA and offers an intriguing story.

My gaming rig consists of an AMD Ryzen 5800X, an AMD Radeon 6900XT, 32 GB RAM, and a Samsung 990 Pro.

Update: After spending more time with the game, my appreciation for it has only grown. The game clearly bears the Arkane stamp, and the attention to detail in various locations is evident. The AI could use some improvement, especially in terms of situational awareness, but it does pose a challenge when faced with multiple enemies. After 33 hours of gameplay, I’m nearing the end, although the game does feel a bit stretched out.

Final Verdict: Having completed the game, I can say that I enjoyed it. While it may not be Arkane’s finest work, it was a worthwhile experience. I would rate it a solid 6.5/10.",True,4,2105

Redfall,1294810,147468860,"Updated Review - 5/7/24
My original review was positive, perhaps due to hope this would get a turnaround... it didn't, it had some fixes but very bare-bones.

Picked this up for dirt cheap solely to mess around. 
I don't recommend this game unless you get it very cheap, and even than only barely, understand what you are getting into, it's barely a game.

The good: Overall game with potential, somewhat unique mechanics, solid writing and a nice art-style. With a simple sandbox, and unique setting. It definitely has the base design to be something good.
Had some good fun for a few hours using some we-mod cheats, and playing it more as a sandbox than a real game.


The bad: Unfortunately its not finished and not good for actual game-play. Completely destroyed by its clear lack of passion, polish, and even finish.
This game is unfinished, missing animations and textures, bugs, broken areas, invisible enemies, fire and explosives with irrational radius, few quests, mostly fake and copied structures, small overall map, non-narrative campaign for the most part, little to no inventory management, boring guns, no customization past a few basic skins, no deep collectors item, no worthwhile loot rarity system for exploring harder areas, and literally every other possible bug that comes with a game that has no soul or purpose to exist.

Well done, Arkane!

-----------------

I don't see what all of the negative hype is about this game.  

It's an incredibly fun co-op shooter that feels like Far Cry or The Division. The vampires are very well done and have caused me to jump MULTIPLE times when I'm coming around a corner or up a set of stairs. (My favorite was literally walking up a set of stairs and seeing the legs of a vampire, who was just sitting at the top waiting for me.)  The battles are balanced, the weapons are great, but the sound really makes this stand out.  Grab your best pair of headphones and tap them up a notch.

The world is wonderful - climb to the top of the lighthouse and look around.  That's just an amazing view.  The missions are great. Go back and play Far Cry 4 - it's right in line with that.

Issues?  Sure - every new game has some issues.  I was able to play Redfall just fine from Day 1.  And it's continuing to get better.

Do yourself a favor, look past the negative reviews, and go enjoy this game.",True,8,2327
Redfall,1294810,146410341,"Overall it's a well balanced FPS; I have enjoying playing it this far. The map is big enough with a lot of opportunities for exploration in between quests.

There are two things that I don't like:
1) The limitation of weapons one can use; it's 3. It's not enough; it should be at least 4.
2) You can't save and if you die you return to the closest base.",True,5,19644
Redfall,1294810,146346765,"Alright, I've been patient enough. After having waited for over 4 months for Arkane to work on this game, I'm seriously extremely disappointed. We only got 3 updates, 2 of which were ""hot fixes"" and 1 of which was a ""Regular Update"". This first ""Regular Update"" was released 3 months ago. The updates have helped a bit but not nearly enough to say this game has no issues or even remotely playable.

There has been NO communication whatsoever from Arkane, they still tweet somewhat regularly but it's all stuff like ""Bribon deserves all the pets."" and absolutely NOTHING regarding the state of the game, no road map, just nothing. 
Will they ever actually fix Redfall? Honestly, I seriously doubt it at this point, wouldn't be surprised if they just completely abandon this game without a word if they haven't already.
I hate to say this because I actually like most of Arkane's games, but I lost all trust in them. It wouldn't even be that bad if they actually communicated but of course we're left in the dark.


Edit: Got another ""Regular update"" today (6 October, 2023), yes still the same year miraculously, 15 GB and apparently lots of improvements. I'll update the game and update the review later on.

Yes, so far this will mostly be about the optimization of the game because honestly, fuck everything else if you can't even run the game properly, then who cares about what is being added?

Alright so I played for like half an hour so far, these are first impressions after the update so take it with a grain of salt. So far the game is definitely better optimized, still having a couple decently big frame drops here and there in the cities, sometimes during fights, but only for like a second. Out of cities I have around 90 - 100 FPS, in cities around 60 - 80, in fights around 60 - 75. Sometimes my FPS dips down to 50, the worst dip I had was 24 but only for a split second.
I don't have the best PC but definitely not the worst, here are my specs for those who want to know so you have some sort of idea if this would run well for you (Graphic settings on High):

Motherboard: B550-A PRO
CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X
GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600
RAM: 32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200

So far it's definitely looking better which I'm glad to say.
I'll keep playing more and I'll keep updating this review. Let's hope Arkane keeps updating the game but actually communicate, give us some sort of idea what is going to be added, ANYTHING. Besides that, good shit so far Arkane, better keep it up, but for fuck sake, once again, communicate with us.

5 November update: FPS has remained the same as mentioned above which is a really good thing obviously. There are some weird glitches in the game, for example:
When climbing a ladder you sometimes glitch out when reaching the top and you fall down.
There have been issues where half your character glitches through the floor and you rubberband with every step you take.

The NPCs are IMO still too easy, even on the ""Midnight"" (Hard) difficulty, very squishy. Yes this also counts for the big bad vampires.

19 November update: There are some really frustrating bugs with some of the characters. As Layla you sometimes will be stuck in the Umbrella animation and can't interact with anything or use any weapons. Jason (Layla's ult) sometimes just freezes which also causes her to not be able to do anything. Remi's robot, Bribon has probably the worst AI I've ever seen. Jacob sometimes pulls out his ghost sniper and it just disappears as if you didn't use the ult. Devinder seems to be the most polished character.",False,199,1477

At the time of writing, this game is 4 months and a few days after release, and from a gameplay standpoint, this feels identical to the horrible state this game launched in. I'm not going to pretend I know the state of things at Arkane or who might still be working on this game, but this is a terrible blemish on a great year of releases that seemingly has no plans for support. 2-3 rounds of updates over the past 4 months has changed NOTHING about actually playing the game. Mind you, I'm only on High settings with DLSS enabled and the game has low frame-rate (30-50 fps) and multi-second long stutters at frequent intervals. Frankly, there's no excuse for the state of this game and still having it be publicly available. I'd love to see this game in a playable state, but I fear that may never happen.

Looking at the generic copy+paste response from Bethesda Support above really does answer my question about who's supporting this game: Nobody. This is a PR triage to save a little bit of face, and coming from Bethesda, this is incredibly disappointing. To be hunting around for negative posts among the sea of them flooding this Steam page to reply to my review with this is embarrassing. Absolutely no regard for what was stated in my actual review and offering me the bare minimum of ""support"".

Redfall,1294810,145267763,"I bought the deluxe edition off CD Keys for cheaper than the regular version on Steam. I have played through the game on 2 characters and here are my thoughts. The game has a solid premise and is ""fun"" but I cannot recommend it for the price or length of the game. If you can find it on a crazy good sale or have game pass and can play for free then give it a try, but don't have high expectations.

Pros:
- Difficulty does not effect achievements or in game drops (from what I can tell)
- Fun premise, think Borderlands and Resident Evil 4 had a vampire Psycho baby and let it run wild.
- The characters are all unique and their abilities make each one fun in their own way.
- A decent story that unfolds through a play through with added bits in ""files"" you can find and audio collectibles (gravelocks)
- Each character has a legendary weapon type specifically for them.

Cons:
- A multitude of glitches that have yet to be patched. From main story missions glitching on steps until you exit, change difficulty and reload (sometimes multiple times if the quest has several steps that can glitch), side quests showing up that you've already completed, environmental collision, poor enemy AI (even on harder difficulties), sound glitches that make alarms continue going off until you exit the game and reload, 
- Overall limited weapon selection. Few legendary weapons that are shared between all characters: 4 pistols, 4 shotguns, and 3 assault rifles. All other non legendary weapons have little variety and aren't far off from the legendary in stats
- No random match making, you have to have friends lists
- Must always be online to play even in single player
- Story is fairly short, you can play through the campaign on easiest difficulty in about 8-12 hours depending on if you want to explore some side quests (which are also limited)

It started out so great and then slowly got more glitchy as you progressed. I am so disappointed because of the completely wasted potential of this game.

I have a harder time finding sympathy because like yeah working on something you don't like SUCKS but 90% of people do that everyday and this was your job? However I 100% admit that I have no foot in this race and no experience to speak of so what do I know?

Redfall,1294810,145137537,"It breaks my heart but where Deathloop wasn't for me yet I could recommend it to others I just can't recommend Redfall. There's nothing it does that you can't find done better elsewhere.

+Arkane stylised characters return, mostly work out. The animations are a little stiff, more noticeable on the vampires imo.

+The setting's interesting, who doesn't love vampires? Open world town to explore, the vibrant Arkane style also applies to the environment. There are a lot of interesting scenes to be found in the world that make you want to find out what happened there.

   

-The game commits the 2 cardinal sins of collectables: it doesn't track completed pickups on your map and the reward for collecting them is minuscule.

-Safehouse missions: If you accept a safehouse mission then quit before completion it doesn't stay in your log, you need to go back to the safehouse you picked it up from and restart it.

-Ammo counter bugs out and loses track of your ammo.

-Playing on a 4090, 7800X3D with 64gb DDR5 while most gameplay is smooth there are noticeable hitches when reaching denser regions with lots of environmental details or effect heavy scenes.

-While the game is open world the town is divided into 2 maps and once you enter the second you can't return to the first. I can't recall if there was a warning about this (in case you wanted to finish any side missions or collectables) but there is no reason you shouldn't be able to choose to go back to the first map.

-Arkane games aren't exactly cutscene reliant to my knowledge, mostly delivering story through in game dialogue, audiologs or written pieces. Redfall has written pieces but most of the significant story beats will be through cutscenes of still models or in-game memory echoes of still models. It's not terrible, the voice work is good, but it's not great.

-Lockpicks: There are a lot of locks to pick in this open world game but rather than being a skill, it just relies on consumable lockpicks which cap at 3 (for three out of four characters). Weapons can be found in every type of container so it seems you're never not going to want to open a container. You can buy more from safehouses/base but fast travel to and fro just to buy lockpicks breaks the flow of gameplay significantly. I guess this could be less of a thing when playing as a party, more lockpicks in total but for solo it's not good.

-Skills: Having set characters with set skill...sets detracts from the appealing thing about Arkane games imo. Their best game Prey 2017 is a masterclass in giving you a world to explore with clever level design that allows the player to overcome obstacles both with basic exploration and with their choice of skills; climb across pipes and vents to reach a drop ceiling, shapeshift into a coffee mug to fit through a gap, hack the lock, use strength to pry open a door. In Redfall one character has a translocate that allows you to bypass some obstacles, another has a leap ability that gives you some extra height. Every character has lockpicks and electronic bypass kits but not enough to allow you to interact freely; you might use your last pick on a door only to find the next room full of locked chests you now can't open without cutting your trip short for a supply run.
I don't see myself replaying Redfall but if I did, I don't think I'd play on a different character. Losing the translocate would render Redfall very mundane to me.

-The different weapon types each have uses but you can only equip 3 at a time. In a better Arkane game, you had a weapon/ability spiral so you could scroll through everything in your inventory and each ability.

-Characters with periodic background speech delivered through radios etc may continue to speak after killing them.

-There's an overall lack of polish in the world noticeable when items overlap (multiple item boxes in exactly the same spot, other item boxes placed so close they're half inside each other), inconsistent climbing mechanics (some waist high walls you can't climb and some you can, ledges you can't climb that you should be able to, ledges you climb but then slide off), barriers blocking pathing (an open path where you'll need to jump over an invisible obstacle).

-Enemies in general do not have great AI but some such as the Angler can do a lot of damage that seems excessive (casts a hook that grabs you, pulls you in, takes off something like 30-40% health and you are vulnerable to other enemies during all this). You'll also notice that normal vampire swipe attacks extend quite a bit further than their animation indicates.



To sum up, it's not a completely broken game. I found the world just interesting enough to finish the story, there's a lot of environmental storytelling and atmosphere is appealing. The story itself isn't groundbreaking but it's not bad. There are some ways in which you can find alternate paths, use abilities to find different approaches but very few in comparison to previous Arkane games. It is not the worst game ever made but it is probably the worst Arkane game ever made.

Each character only has two, plus another ultimate. The game therefore seems to have more of the co-op functionality, in which the four of you can use the strengths and weaknesses of each character and creatively eliminate the vampires.

Watch a snippet of gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC0W9BJxWw8

Vampires are not the only threat.
Most of the islanders have joined cults, worshiping one of the great vampires in the hope that they won't be drained themselves.
And then the private military company Bellwether also shoots anything that moves.
Only at safe houses and a hub you will encounter friendly faces and you can buy weapons, health kits and other useful items.
Speaking of weapons, there is a lot of diversity.
You can expect common weapons such as pistols, shotguns and sniper rifles, but they all have their own rarity, perks and properties. Redfall also has a number of unique 'shooting irons', such as a stake launcher and UV beam.
Those last two are mainly for use against vampires, who appear as stronger opponents than the human foot soldiers.
When you have reduced their hit points to zero, you must finish it off with a wooden stake for the heart.

The game also works perfect on the steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhwPQduMOpw

Vampires also have special powers. Think of teleportation, being able to drain life points and using a human as a shield, a bit funny though.
It is therefore wise to equip your loadout with weapons that are useful in different situations.
Fortunately, due to the great diversity of weapons, this is quite possible and it ensures that it remains fun to find loot in the game because it is not repeated so quickly.
In the beginning you will notice that as a player you are controlled fairly tightly.
You have not yet discovered much in the world, the side missions are not there yet and you have not yet found the safehouses with associated missions. This allows time and space to get to know the different skills and to absorb the lore that the world has to offer.

Redfall,1294810,143542026,"Initial 4.5 hour assessment:

I love the spooky Halloween/ Harvest themed town, the vampires look pretty cool...and Boy is it satisfying to stake vampires! If only there were more ways to stake them, based on your angle of attack (i.e. behind, to the side, in front...etc). The gameplay is pretty good, but the enemy AI often run around damn near in circles, before they decide you're there and turn around to take aim. Sometimes the AI even run past you all together. Most other games the AI may get momentarily startled, sure...but they always and immediately raise their guns to fire. These particular cultists, however, seem unsure about their allegiance.

Gameplay is incredibly classic, like playing Timesplitters, Halo 1, or the original Perfect Dark, in that you just feel like a floating camera with a gun floating closely by the side of the screen. Aiming down the sights is not so much the feeling of a gun being pulled up to your face, as it is a gun model floating to the center of the green, to signify looking down the sights. Coupled with their being no melee weapons, assassination moves, aerial stealth kills...it's just a clean-cut and completely classic retro shooter, but with sliding. Still, it's quite an alright game.

The graphics are great for the art style. The art style for the characters resembles something like Fable, in that it's kind of cartoony, but done in a realistic looking environment.

Micro-stutters are very present in this game: I can be running a solid 80FPS, 4K and walking up and down a strip of area, hit the stutters and suddenly drops to 41FPS (in half), on a dime. I can then walk through the area where slowdown momentarily occurred, several times and the issue does not repeat, so it is not an issue that is relative to where you are or what is happening at the time. It's like lightning and will not strike in the same place twice. This paints the feeling that it's maybe a memory unloading issue, or, perhaps a memory leak. 

Lack of AI squad is disappointing, to say the lease. I mean, it's marketed as a squad game...so where's my NPC squad? I had imagined it would be a bit like Gears of War, or Mass Effect in terms of AI squad dynamics.

All-in-all? This game still has the potential to be my favorite loot shooter since Destiny! Even with all the critiques.  I just feel like it should have aimed to be more like Doom 2016 or Doom Eternal, than a squadless squad shooter. The setting and uniqueness of the games is fun in its own right, barring the poor voice acting.  

I have faith Arcane will fix and polish it--hopefully even do a Cyberpunk level overhaul but I know that's a rare thing to find...and since the developers are not talking, or announcing their plans, it is more likely that the devs may opt to go the Mass Effect: Andromeda route and just get the game playable and bail...which is the route that the recently released Forspoken also took.

Revised review after update 4:

This game is some simple fun - but don't buy it at the current price, get it with gamepass or at a deep sale.

This game can be fun at times, but don't expect deep gameplay mechanics. Combat can be fun, but it's pretty basic and there are just two types of enemies: Humans and Vampires, plus some bosses. The two maps are designed aesthetically with a lot of love, but they are a little sterile and lifeless nonetheless. The loot and level systems work, but are nothing to write home about. The game can be played coop, but there is no (!) way to play with randoms, there is no server browser or matchmaking at all, so you have to invite friends or play solo. If you intend to play solo, it can be played offline after update 4.

One last sentence to the technical state: There are some bugs, but I didn't encounter anything serious. The performance has been improved vastly thanks to the updates. I consider it fine now.

They fixed lot of bugs and it's way better now.
Redfall is still not what I would call a great game but it's far from being garbage.
Full price it is certainly not worth it due to the clear lack of polish but if you find it on a good discount it's well worth a try in my opinion.
I played for around twenty hours so far and I can say I'm mostly having a good time playing the game, there seem to be a decent amount of content if you explore and do side missions.

Redfall deliver nice graphics with cool visual style packed into an interesting open world map to explore.
Most areas are well designed and you can still see the Arkane dna here with lot of verticality and different paths available to you for your missions and exploration.
Fighting vampires and humans is refreshing and it's a breathe of fresh air compared to your average zombies slaying apocalypse.

Redfall gunplay while not stellar is enjoyable for the most part, sadly when playing solo the combat may feel clunky and unfair when facing lot of enemies because some of them can teleport and warp to random locations. The vampires have questionable reach to their lunge attacks and human gunners also hit really hard and you can easily die in a few seconds if you don't have any cover since the game really love to throw swarms of enemies at you, clearly some balancing issues here.
To put it simply the combat is enjoyable only when facing three or four enemies, when there's more things can quickly turn into a cluster fuck.
Despite it's problems the combat still qualify to something I would categorize as decent and thanks to the different classes available each with their unique abilities it actually give us more replayability.
There is a progression system and a skill tree for all classes, you gain XP by killing monsters, completing missions or discovering stuff on the map, it's nothing too deep but it's appreciable.
Sadly the loot system is boring and poorly thought out and there is not enough different weapons here.

On a technical standpoint well unfortunately Redfall still have many annoying bugs left unpatched like the House of Echoes mission where you can end up being softlocked because you cannot interact with the psychic echoes.
Enemies AI can glitch quite a lot here, sometimes they may shoot you through walls, they can get stuck in geometry or for some reasons they may completely turn invisible.
Pretty often you may find npc civilians stuck in a t-pose scattered around the map
The game's performances clearly leave something to be desired, framedrops and stutters can occur for no apparent reasons.

There is also huge problems with visibility to spot many items required to progress the missions, it's just tedious running around in circles trying to find these poorly highlighted minuscule damn items.
They claim to have fixed the infinite loading screen issue that can happen if you alt tab when initiating a fast travel across the map but it's still there.
On a positive note I haven't experienced any crashes in twenty hours, the only time I was forced to alt-f4 was when the infinite loading bug happened.
Anyway for me these technical issues are unacceptable coming from a huge studio and publisher like Arkane/Bethesda even more so when they price the game that high.

TLDR: Not entirely a bad game at all but far from being as good as previous Arkane masterpieces. Wait for huge discount.

[h1]Rating 6/10.[/h1]",True,52,1695
Redfall,1294810,141434067,"Review update after October 6 patch:

As I mention in my review, this game could end up around 7/10 with proper polish and updates. Well, after spending quite a few hours with this new update - I'm ready to give it at least 7.5/10.

Do note that this is subjective and has a lot to do with me enjoying exploration, looting and the overall setting very much. For people who're not into this type of game - it might still read as average at best.

But, for me, this is now around what I originally hoped it would be - and that's saying something.

Also, this is the perfect Halloween game - for sure. But they really need to reduce the price a bit. 70 euro is too steep - especially given the abysmal launch.

-----

This is a hard game to review objectively.

Naturally, it's impossible to be fully objective - but I think it's useful to try and understand how other people operate and what kind of preferences exist out there.

In a vacuum, this game is a middling open world shooter - with a decent amount of lore and loot to find. It's playable solo, but I feel like it was designed around the coop experience.

So, if you play it as intended - there's fun to be had, as long as you keep your expectations in check.

Now, I haven't completed it - and I don't know how this game works in the longer term. I played most of my time with the Game Pass version.

But, I've played my fair share of coop looters - which is essentially what this is. From this perspective, I feel qualified to estimate the overall rating this game should receive.

As it stands, after the first patch - I'd say this game is around 5/10 for a solo player - leaning towards 6/10 as a coop game.

Positives include a neat concept with an intriguing setting. Surprisingly, there's also a lot of optional stuff to discover if you explore the various buildings and areas.

Negatives, sadly, are represented quite significantly. Everything about the AI is undercooked - and the world feels more dead than undead, if you know what I mean. Stealth is incredibly basic and seems to be made with minimal effort. Beyond that, the story is presented almost like an indie title would do it. This is in stark contrast with the asking price.

As for the average - I'd say the loot and combat would qualify. It's there and ranges between decent and boring - but overall just OK.

If they manage to spice it up a little more, especially when it comes to AI, world activities and enemy density - as well as polishing it to a higher standard, I think this could end up around 7/10.

Keep in mind that I'm a relatively harsh critic - and a lower score isn't a death sentence as far as I'm concerned. It's simply a more conservative approach to evaluating the good with the bad. 

Beyond that, I tend to find that Arkane games get more credit than they really deserve, but again, that's subjective. I've liked all their games for the most part, but they struggle with the finer things, including balance and especially the item economy - both of which are way, way too lax in all their titles to the point where you can trivialize any challenge - even on the hardest difficulties - once you've established your arsenal a bit. This is no different.

However, there's enough good for me to recommend it - but it's most definitely not a must have, and I certainly don't think it's worth anywhere near what they're charging.

So, wait for a sale - and go in with tempered expectations - and you'll find an experience that's significantly better than what seems to be the mainstream consensus.",True,4,3469

Co-op is a buggy mess, but I haven't come across anything game breaking, and it's still a lot of fun. The interaction between the main chars is cute, and sometimes hilarious.

The story is interesting - but it requires some leg-work and note-reading if you want to see the full picture. All notes you open are saved in your archive though, so you can pick up fast when your friends are in a hurry looting and read everything later. 

The world feels quite empty, there aren't enough enemies re-spawning in the streets or buildings (and definitely not enough car or burglary alarms). When you have roamed around and killed everything once there's just the small events (nests and rooks) left. You are forced to continue the main story to find more stuff to do, and I wish there were way more small encounters and more side quests.

With future patches, the game should continue to improve, so for those who think the normal price is a little steep (which it is, especially at the game's retail price), wait a bit for the price to go down because at that point, a lot of the bugs and technical gripes others and myself have had with the game will probably be fixed, leading to a much better experience. That said, don't buy this expecting an experience like Prey, Dishonored, or even Deathloop (or basically just any Arkane game for that matter), Redfall is very much its own thing in that regard, for better or worse.

Redfall,1294810,140778789,"Mostly Negative is a pretty accurate review, I have played it start to finish with 2 others and have seen most of the glitches and desync this game has to offer. The concept of taking back the world map from the enemies is great the whole colony stay in 1 building is terrible, if they had small branches of the faction move out to ""safe locations"" to make you feel like you achieved something that would be great rather than just killing vampires till the rook shows up. 
Followed by using the stake launcher for an easy 1 hit kill on the rook and insanely easy legendary weapon farming. 
To then head back to the only compound to restart the next mission... BORING.
The ability to move backwards and forwards between maps shouldn't be limited to 1 run or 1 play through with a specific character that takes away from the game quite a lot, Having to start a new character because you missed a single item for 100% completion! YUCK! How ever it is good that you don't have to re-find all grave locks you have already picked up from the initial playthrough. 
This game had the potential to be so much better than it was, Maybe in a year if the bugs have been ironed out ill play it again and amend the review but then again maybe Arkane Austin and Bethesda have already scrapped the idea to fix whats wrong with it. 
If you happen to get the game for free and want to try a challenge be 20 levels lower than the lobby leader and you'll find you will run out of bullets before you have the ability to head shot a group of enemies the coding for the level adjustment also needs work.

Redfall,1294810,139849965,"RE-review.

When I first played Redfall it was a janky mess that was ""interesting"" without actually having much value, there was a lot of ""ah, I wonder what they were trying to do there"" or ""isn't it a shame that didn't quite work out"" and a lot of ""what the hell were they thinking?!""

Mostly, the price tag was stupid, releasing it on xbox gamepass at the same time meant no-one would buy it, and the prospect of DLC characters was laughable.

But then the game got patched, and slowly from the mountainous turd there were some small glimmers of potential - all leading up to Update 4.

Update 4 is an enormous undertaking, not least because it came out after the company had died.
It rebalances huge amounts of the game, including the ability to earn skillpoints beyond levelling, new weapons, new arenas, a bunch of QOL options that are unlocked and a secondary progression system through the neighbourhood renown they added.

It does not completely revive redfall, ironically staked to ash and not rising out of its coffin - but it does turn the half-formed mess into a much better experience.

If ever it's cheap (or free) I recommend giving Redfall a go. It's a far cry from other Arkane games, but there's some fun to be had here, and if nothing else I'll be sad it never got the chance to be the game it so clearly COULD have been.",True,4,6940

I can't.

The game is redeemable, with future updates and content.  The gameplay itself isn't the worst thing in the world.  But frankly the game is a 6/10 at best, and the absolute silence from the dev team and lack of updates in over a month (and no, the backend update a week after launch doesn't count), the game is officially dead on arrival.  I'll probably continue playing and replaying it with a friend of mine, but ultimately I've fully lost hope in the game being salvaged to even an 8/10 state at this point.

Communication was all that was needed, really.  Sure it wouldn't have saved this failure of a launch, but it would've helped soothe the worries and the poor launch for those of us who saw the potential of a stable game in there.

Don't waste your money on this.  The guns are random AF, the drops are worse, the balance is crap, the AI is some of the stupidest I've ever seen in a post-PS2 era game, the world is depopulated to hell and back, Co-op makes the game easier not harder (as in literally less enemies spawn in co-op than in solo play), and the bulk of everything going on is frankly just not engaging with almost only one exception.",False,9,2547

Zone 1 feels really nice to complete if you rush the main story to enable the Rook, then do side objectives. However if you didn't do that it was incredibly boring as the enemies rarely challenged even on the hardest difficulty and there was no Rook to spice things up.
Zone 2 had a big difficulty spike and several encounters in Zone 2 felt tuned specifically to balance for multiplayer leaving a worse experience for Solo play.

Interesting premise but executed like garbage
- No animated cut-scenes
- Poor story telling
- Forced story events are usually still transparent models talking with no graphical aid for visualisation
- Majority of the lore is hidden in notes and world curious that are annoying to find and interact with and boring to read
- Because of poor story telling, villains are not very interesting aside from ""Typical megalomaniac on a power trip""
- Meaningless/non-existent interaction between the playable characters, almost like it was designed to be a single-player game

Performance is garbage despite mediocre graphics
- Mid-tier laptop (6800HS + 3070 Mobile) cannot keep 60FPS on 1080P minimum settings (DLSS does nothing and sometimes makes it worse)
- Decent PC (5800X3D + 6900XT overclocked) can hardly keep over 90FPS on 1440P medium preset
- Turns into a slideshow in some scenarios with drops to 4-5FPS

Gameplay
- World is 95% (approximation) empty space, 5% Points of Interest with enemies
- Boring travel point to point due to lack of enemies, despite heavily implying the town is overrun with vampires
- Character personalities are anaemic
- Character skill trees are uninspiring, with one character having major advantage in utility compared to the others
- Some skill upgrades are conflicting
[b]Example[/b]: Jakob's scanning Raven's damage upgrade means enemies become alert and stealth is lost, not exactly beneficial when sneaking or long-range sniping as they will always know where you are and rush you
- Dumb as bricks AI for both Humans and Vampires
- Most vampires can be circumvented by being on higher ground (insert Star Wars reference) like car or van or having a chest-high object between you and them
- Inventory and Shop UI is very clunky and annoying to use

Guns
- Uninspired choice of standard weapons (Pistol, Revolver, Shotgun, Assault RIfle, Sniper Rifle)
- Weapon balancing is terrible
- Vampire-specific weapons are unique but sometimes unwieldy as most engagement involves human targets
- 3 active weapon slots felt restrictive as at least one is taken up a vampire-specific weapon (though this is personal preference issue)
- Most gun stats such as accuracy are not well explained
- Attachments on guns are seemingly randomised and not indicated in any way.
[b]Example 1[/b]: Sights on an Assault Rifle can be iron-sights or Holo/Red-dot, despite the model and rarity being the same
[b]Example 2[/b]: Sniper rifles can be silenced or un-silenced and has no indication unless you equip it and inspect the model or shoot the gun
- Numerical Bonuses on rare guns (green and above) tend to reset when reloading game session [i]So say goodbye to that new legendary weapon every time you sign off[/i]
[b]Example 1[/b]: Increased mag size from 15 to 20 on a rifle will revert back to 15 after quitting and resuming your game
- Unique bonuses (non-numerical) such as being able to kill a vampire with a bullet weapon without staking them is kept

Gunplay
- Most guns feel clunky to use
- Aim-Down-Sight sensitivity is VERY low with no dedicated sensitivity setting, making it hard to track moving targets, much less getting head-shots with precision weapon
(Although the AI are generally dumb and loves to randomly stop moving quite often, they are also prone to making micro-movements to the left and right which can be incredibly frustrating for anyone not using a shotgun)
- Not much variation in engagements

After giving it a solid play, finishing the story as well as all the side-missions we could find, it had no redeeming qualities.
The only upsides were the laughs my group had when a silly bug happens from to time to time.

To start with do not buy this game for £60 as its just not worth that money, sub £35 is justified IMO. The game has loads of potential but quickly becomes a repetitive cycle of missions that have no depth and a continuous cycle of running somewhere, killing vampires and doing it over and over. Once you learn how to kill the different vampires it becomes stale. It’s playable, I’ve played all my hours so far on my steamdeck and it’s only 6 hours in that I’ve discovered bugs and stuttering. It is almost a time killer with a smidge of good story and ability to get me hooked. The gunplay is ok and the ability tree is decent too. I was expecting to play and it be an absolute mess and it’s not. This seems like a negative review but I am looking forward to coming home and playing more even though it is a bit samey.

Now that might not have been to bad had the missions been fun, but they are dull and somewhat repetitive, especially the safe house missions, which are only two per safe house. The game world consists of two towns you have to liberate, but they are not very big, and fast travel points scattered around makes travelling easy.

I like way how vampires are depicted, details of interior in houses from Tiffany like lamps to boxes of pills and violent scenes of vampire apocalypse and general quite good horror vibe, but that's about it what is positive on Redfall's grahics. light, shadows, smoke or liquid look really bad, like from 2000's game, maybe even worse. This is I think the reason, why Arkane has made this weird thing with frozen wawes of ocean water around the island, so they didn't have to create rivers and lakes of water and show us how bad they can be at it. Thinking this way, they also shoudln't include that killing red mist into the game, because it looks extremly ugly, like from some 10 Euro indie game made by two amateur developers in their free time. Also spectrum of colour palette used is not very aesthetic exactly. Character models aren't most modern and beatiful, but Arkane is notoriously bad about this, look for Deathloop or Prey, at least they're trying to compensate it by this simplyfying artistic stylisation. Story, diagolue and lore are more focused and deeper than in Deathloop for example, which was strongly multiplayer orientated, but only a little, it's not as good as in Dishonored. Making only low budget comics-like cutscenes, probably maybe, because they wanted to save money on lipsync was quite dissapointing. Sountrack was above average, like in all Arkane games, but not as that epic as in Prey. Gameplay was ok, combat is fun and over the top, shooting mechanics can pass, but I've seen better, even from Arkane. Quests started to be quite stereotypical in second part of game and that's quite alarming for around 25 hours of gameplay.

Redfall,1294810,138996407,"I would Recommend to play this with a friend. Otherwise i wouldnt recommend it if you're going to solo. 

Ive seen a lot of downvotes from people with less than an hour of playtime. Also only 14% of players have finished the tutorial. This gives you a steam achievement and you can see how many other players got it. 

Now i understand if you dont have a great rig (cpu specifically) and you dont wanna suffer through 20fps. But then i also think its not enough to base a review on.

Ive played the 18 hours with a friend of mine. and there are a few major things both positive an negative that id like to point out. Start

Positive:
* The world is really interesting to explore. Even though the story isnt that special. With fun collectibles that provide passive stats. 

* Different systems that are explained over the course of the first  location you play on (yes you go to a 2nd map) for instance:

- the rarity of weapons determine what attachments could be on it. (but isnt guarenteed) so even the same weapon with the same rarity can have different attachments like a silencer on it.
- The Rook. In the world, the vampire gods can get mad and this can get to a critical point, where they call on the Rook. This ""boss-type"" enemy isnt too hard to beat if you can focus him. He drops a guarenteed legendary weapon. But he's really bad if he is summoned when you're doing something else. 

* Really nice game for Dishonored fans. A lot of the artstyle is similair and the story telling mechanism is exactly the same, with still images of the involved characters with narration. 

Negative:
* It isnt clear at the start, but the game gets an insane difficulty cliff once you get a little further into the 1st location. it seems like it is a tutorial area that isnt pointed out as tutorial. (i dont know this im just speculating) because many people played this game for like an hour and have decided the AI is ret*rded.

* The AI can definitely get a difficulty increase. Even if i haven't played the highest difficulty yet.
* The AI doesnt provide a big enough challenge to use your characters abilities. Especially at the start me and my buddy would forget we had skills we could use. Later this changed with the Vampire nests coming in.
* The game still need a lot of work and sometimes the developers seem a little tone deaf to the situation of this game and its reviews, (for instance publishing a buzzfeed style ""wich character in Redfall are you"" quiz when people were begging for updates and improvements.

Cheers!!,True,4,4649
Redfall,1294810,138780276,"It is now 20 days after release. No communication from the developers, no patch in sight except for a small hotfix.

I finished the game in under 40 hours, I did enjoy playing it for the most part but it has some serious issues.

Good:
- I enjoyed the world. It looks nice and New England-ish. I did not mind the emptiness that much, it brings some tension to roaming around. What is around the corner? There is a lot of wasted potential here, though.
- environmental sound design. Just roam through the neighborhood and listen to it; hum from a transformer, gas flowing for a heater, much more. I did enjoy that.
- the idea of the vampire apocalypse in an isolated town is ok.

Bad:
- silence from the developers. I think it is too late now, soon there will be no players left and interest will be gone.
- horrendous enemy A.I. Every alerted enemy just runs straight at you. No tactics, no cover, just Zerg rush. Remember F.E.A.R. from 2005? THAT is how you would expect a team of soldiers to act.
- low-res shimmering shadows. Come on, you have to be blind to 'miss' this, it was a conscious decision to not make it better.
- flashlight does not cast a shadow.
- psychic echoes look cheap, take too long and are uninteresting. It sucks the life out of the story (pun intended :-p ).
- wasted potential in the world. Yes you have feuding factions that fight each other with bad A.I. , it could have been so much more. Where are the survivors in the streets? If there are hostages, why not have people hiding barricaded in their houses and defending themselves? Where are the animals? Rats, cats, dogs, you name it.
- single slot save.
- bugs in side mission progression. Mission 'Eclipsed' did not end for me despite having all its objectives checked. This means achievement for all side missions cannot be obtained. Add to that the single save slot and lack of a proper load option, dooming you to replay 50% of the game for another 'chance' to get the achievement. How about ""no""?
- bugs in inventory. Old guns and remnants get marked as new over and over again every time the game is started.
- bugs in world POI discovery. 2nd area mission table keeps popping up as newly discovered in every session.
- points of no return. If you pass certain points (transition to next area, and after the ending) it is not possible to return so you'd better have prior knowledge of them and do everything you want to do before it is to late. Same goes for achievements, you need prior knowledge for some. Only fix is to replay the game which is just stupid, not going to happen, I can't be bothered.
- vampire lairs are not made for single players. Hard work, lousy incentives. Why bother?

And probably lots more.

It is clear the game is undercooked. Corners were cut, it is not 'finished'. 

Overall I will not recommend playing this game unless there is a miraculous turn-around in the near future. Fix the bugs, fix the A.I., allow players to return to the other area and continue after ending, add proper save/load system.

Also it would be nice for the devs or publisher to have the common decency to let gamers know that complaints are heard and fixes are being worked on. I love Arkane games. Dishonored, Prey and Deathloop (even Arx Fatalis) are pieces of art, but this unfinished Redfall is unworthy for the likes of Arkane. A blemish on your reputation, and yes you are only as good as your last game.

Oh yeah, got the game with a video card. I will not mark is a 'received for free' because IT IS NOT FREE. This is a deal between the publisher and the manufacturer of the video card; money was exchanged, part of the price of the card was 'reserved' to pay for it. On that same note: technically the game was pre-ordered and registered in Steam before it released, but I did not receive the pre-order bonus (so like, where is it? cheap... not bothered).

Redfall,1294810,138716313,"While I can't recommend the game without it being patched, I can't deny how much fun I'm having with it.
The only issues I ran into were traversal loading frame drops and a few pop-ins, but none of the major widespread bugs.
I'm playing solo and having a blast currently on my second playthrough, but I wish there was a character swap in the main hub or safehouses. My first playthrough was with Devinder, I had a lot of fun, but I'm enjoying Jacob a lot more.

Jacob is like Corvo (Dark Vision) and Colt (Aether)
Layla is like Typhon Morgan (Backlash, Lift Field, Phantom Genesis)
Remi is like Engineer Morgan with a robot companion
And Devinder is like Daud (Arc Mine, Blink, Bend Time for vampires)

Main missions have multiple enemies and Arkane's signature play-your-way style.
My only real complaints about the game are the lack of variety of abilities in single-player and not enough enemies and survivors in the open world map. The game was pushed out way too early, but I still enjoyed it a lot more than Deathloop. 

And I don't get the whole cut-scene backlash. Except for Dark Messiah and Prey, Arkane always uses still/animated slideshows for their cut scenes, unless it's in first-person perspective. Dishonored DLC, Dishonored 2, Death of the Outsider, and Deathloop all had still/animated cutscenes, with a few first-person cut scenes.",True,5,9479
Redfall,1294810,138715413,"I don't understand how someone can think that releasing this was going to recoup costs in any meaningful fashion. Yes, there's times where a product is struggling and it might be a somewhat wise move to pander to the Sunk Cost fallacy, but Redfall isn't one of such occasions. The game's had years in the oven, about as much as your average tentpole release, and what we've received is worse off than No Man's Sky's first release, and certainly worse than Cyberpunk 2077's.

Let's be clear here - I do not blame Arkane Austin. As to why, it's because the guys who gave us PREY or both Dishonored titles have since left both the Austin and Lyon offices. This is an Arkane Austin title in name only, and feels much more like something that should've been marketed as a first outing from an indie studio, something we'd find acceptable if it were Early Access material and if we had the clear understanding that the enemy AI, weapon balance and general plot of the game were all placeholders.

Consider another mostly-vapid Early Access title like V Rising, for instance. There's almost nothing there, beyond the expected grind and the notion that once you've built up your keep and dominated all bosses, you're more or less due for a restart. In V Rising's case, you at least get the sense that the game is being actively worked on. Things could improve over time, and will definitely change.

Not so with Redfall - and that is what's utterly baffling.

If that's all you have to offer as a studio, you don't try and recoup your losses, especially not as part of some weirdo attempt to tout it as one of XBOX Game Pass' more Premium offerings. You could cut your losses, scrap the project - and re-evaluate your design document.

Oh, and above all? Ignore focus groups. I work in Marketing, and I know for a fact that most panel-selected ""gamers"" who get paid to chew on stale donuts and drink free coffee do not know what they want. They know what they like, sure, but they're not in the best position to articulate it. Neither is your board of shareholders. If someone with stocks on the table tells you to work on a concept your team isn't known for successfully tackling, that's an immediate red flag.

Redfall is everything that's wrong with the video games industry as of 2023. Good on you if you've found a few hours' worth of fun with some friends and the dumb enemy AI, but those same friends of yours are worth far, far better. Why play this, when you've got Tiny Tina's Wonderlands or any of the Borderlands games?",False,11,145

Redfall,1294810,138708084,"Just finished the game and all the side quests and now I am qualified to say this game is bad. It was literally painful to finish.  
The story is shallow, the enemies are stupid, and the game is ridiculously easy even on hard.
I did see the attempt to create a story-driven experience: Jacob's background, pretty and immersive interiors here and there. But then none of those were actually finished. The last couple of quests in the main story are not even properly written, we get 3 empty flashbacks for each of vampire gods that don't add anything to the lore, story or character development. The ending cutscene is a slideshow full of mediocre semi-finished 2D art.
TL;DR Arcane, plz, wake up and create smth better next time. This game is broken beyond repair, and I don't even mean the optimisation. It is broken in its core, and no patching can fix it.
",False,6,2142
Redfall,1294810,138688226,"Just finished up my time with Redfall, I completed all the side and main missions in the game and tried to do as much as I could really. I played on the normal difficulty and found myself finished up in about 13hrs, which for the price they put on this game is ridiculous. 

Some points to note below:

- Story was pretty meh and cringey throughout, nothing worth gripping.
- World is beautiful, it felt like they spent most of their time building this world and it does pop!
- Gunplay was meh, felt exciting in the middle of my playthrough with different options, but I ended up sticking with the same gun types as I felt comfortable with them.
- I played Solo as the game obviously advertised Solo & Coop play. This did not feel like a solo experience at all, not being able to pause mid-game, when you died it just put you at the nearest fast travel point and you could just walk up and continue the fight which made dying rendered useless. Parts of the dialogue were built for multiple people, at one point I walked up to a gate and it referenced multiple people in the dialogue and i'm just stood there on my own. Some fights were pretty overwhelming for 1 person but I'd imagine a doddle with 2+. 
- The text heavy pages/books/lore got boring really quick and I completed ignored them after a while as I just wasn't gripped into it at all.
- Resonating with others, I agree with the AI, just needs smartening up.
- FPS was all over the place, I play at 4K 144hz on a 4090 and I was just struggling in parts of the open world. Entering any other realm net me a solid 140fps, but the main world would just see drops all of the time from 80ish down to 30 and giving stuttering.

Finally the biggest disappointment from me is the radio silence from the devs, there is some good core gameplay here but bugs need fixing and performance needs an overhaul.

Enemy, level, and Gunplay Mechanics, they absolute get repetitive. Shoot vampire till it enters stake state, stake it, done. What about UV Guns? Just point till they turn to stone.

We all got duped by this studio. We played on the hardest setting and NOTHING really changed. There is no real exploring, no true story, and it's lame. 

Bethesda should be sad to have its name attached to this game.  I have over 500 hours invested in Skyrim, and Fallout 4. I love that both of those games are huge, with many interactions, and the ability to mod them to create even more quests. I miss the character creation, exciting battles, and exploration. I had hoped that the ""nest"" quests in Redfall would add some of that excitement, but it becomes as mundane as the constant chaos levels in Tiny Tina's Wonderlands (but TTW was a lot more fun).

- It's a good shooter
- Interesting open-world exploration or sight-seeing
- Stealth and Action possiblity with AI adatpting to it
- Idea is somewhat new and unexplored
- 4 playable character with distinct combat/stealth mechanics
- A full skilltree with manifold skills
- A loot system with alot of items laying around, making the world ""lived-in""
- A rarity system that adds boni on you weapons
- A level system that make your old weapons obsolete and keep you searching for better
- A variety of weapon types to choose from and to customize your playstyle

[h2]BUT...[/h2]
- Horrible shooting animations, lagging reloads (rubberbanding magazines lagging behind the animations)
- They made so much effort to be interesting and diversified but then just plain copy-pastat all the rest of the assets. ""Dungeons"" (Hearts) are only just not enough variety to stay interesting
- The Human-AI is not optimized for neither stealth or shooting and they switch between those two modes it jarring and results in T-Posing, gliding around, rubberbanding, deforming (e.g. holding their weapon behind their back to shoot at you and more)
- Vampires is not your everyday concept for horror, but could be soooo good if they wouldn't have littered the whole world with them and made them extreme push-overs 
- Don't bother about every one of the characters, one has UV powers and teleport. Every other it focused on the humans that are already easy as all heck. Please make at least TWO usefull against the 2 types of enemies...
- Every skill needs to be skilled in order to get in the upper skilltree, rendering the possibility to decide obsolete
- No item is used in any meaningful way, the give you health by chugging any drinkable, eatable (may it be chips to full on bottles full with alcohol) and the other give you ""support"" what is essential just a unfitting word for mula, money, kaching-kaching. You EVEN SPEND IT. Where on earth you spend ""support"" on weapons. Make it money ffs.
- The ""rarity"" system is completely obsolete, because every unique weapon is not at all unique and you find them at specific points after a short wait of a in-game day or smth like that
- You always need the new weapon, because the enemies scale with your level so even your best weapon ts bad fast. Not like other games where a ""normal"" weapon is worth a level or two and unique weapons worth five or more. It feels immediately outdated and you need to skavenge more robbing you essentially of gametime that could be spend playing the story and having fun
- 2 weapon variations for every type of weapon for a looter shooter is just not enough and boring as HECK

[h2]AND...[/h2]
It's sadly the principle of ""death by thousand cuts"". 

Map Problems:
- Small bugs in Models, 
- off-limit housing in an exploration game,
- to little loot in a looter shooter,
- HOLLOW-MAN VOICE LINE SPAM,
- detection through solid objects,
- Hitscan in a 2023 game,
- Damage range dropoff (like I play a game of nerf against aimbots with nailguns)
- Enemies plain missing / not spawning in

Coop Problems:
- Coop Partner interaction voice line spam (all two of them),
- Coop Hit-box Wandering,
- Coop animations are bugged,
- So.much.missing.collision

No eye for detail:
- floating world-objects
- models clipping through walls,
- low-res textures,

- textures blurry,
- laggy on mid-to-high settings on a high-end-pc,
- framedrops of doom,
- stutters
- and crashes

Redfall,1294810,138551340,"I honestly feel like everyone is being too harsh on this game.

I'm not going to say it's amazing. And it DEFINITELY isn't up to the standards of Deathloop, Dishonored 2, or (my favorite Arkane game) Prey. Not even close. And I won't pretend that I'm not disappointed about that. I am. I went into this hoping for basically a Borderlands game but with the quality and wonder of the previous Arkane games. And it is NOT that.

But at the same time, people calling it the ""worst game of the year"" and ""not even worth playing for free on game pass"" are being hyperbolic and cruel. It's not THAT bad. I don't find the game world to be empty like other people are saying. Especially once (slight spoiler) vampire nests and the Rook Storm are introduced. I find the gun play satisfying enough, I enjoy the character abilities a lot, and the story is nice! I've beaten the game as Devinder, I've started the game as Jacob & Layla to try them out, and I'm currently playing multiplayer as Remi. And I'm still enjoying it a lot. Enough that I still plan to play through the game again (at least a little) as the extra characters they plan to release later.

The ONLY actual problem I have is the difficulty scaling in multiplayer. The game can sometimes be challenging solo, but in multiplayer, it is so easy it's boring (unless you have already beaten the game once and set it to the highest ""Eclipse"" difficulty). The game needs to either SIGNIFICANTLY beef up the enemies in multiplayer or make the hordes much much larger.

But every other complaint I've seen people mention? I'm not saying they aren't legit, but I don't think they're as bad as people are pretending they are. Although, to be fair, I don't really care about graphical glitches. I find it silly when people act like that sort of thing ruins a game. But if graphical issues are SUPER important to you, that will definitely be a problem.

Overall I would say that the game is good but not great in solo...and okay in multiplayer. It's definitely not as terrible as some people like to say, but not as good as I was hoping it would be. And the few legit issues it does have seem like things that could get patched.",True,37,4666
Redfall,1294810,138543902,"Feels like a parody of a triple-A game made by a parody of a studio released by a parody of a publisher that is owned by Microsoft who feel like a parody in themselves when it comes to gaming.

As many others mentioned before, Redfall plays like a 20€ - 30€ early access game created by an indie developer who hasn't really figured out yet what sort of generic game they want to make.

It tries to be a shooter, but the mechanics are basically worse than those of many games from 10 - 15 years ago.
It tries to be a story driven adventure, but lacks both an interesting story and any engaging storytelling outside constant voice-overs and a lot of dull flashbacks.
It tries to be an open-world game, but the world itself feels surprisingly static, without much sense of wonder and barely any reason for exploration beyond the main story missions.
It tries to be a stealth game during many missions, but once you bring a couple of friends with you pretty much everything can be and will be steamrolled.
It tries to be a multi-player game, or it was at least marketed as one, but it even lacks basic features one would expect from an always online single-player game.
[b]However, worst of all:[/b] It tries to be a game about Vampires, but neither re-invents their interactions or depiction nor conforms to the long established norms of the genre.

If one looks a bit closer at some of the mechanics and past the bugs, glitches or quirks, one has to wonder if the studio could have made a decent game with another year or two of development time or if we finally have entered the era of gaming where people happily pay for perceived quantity of content over any resemblance of quality of that content in video games.
Maybe MS goes for a ""No Man's Sky""-style rework of this game, but personally I'd guess some game devs in Austin will be looking for a new studio soon.

I love Arkane games because I love great single player, story driven game with cool powers and excellent level design.

The combat could use some polish but generally felt good, all the weapon classes felt like they had unique strengths and weaknesses and the special vampires had neat gimmicks.

I frequently run for several minutes across the world and encounter no enemies at all and nothing interesting to investigate. There's loot, but even though it uses a coloured rarity system the level is really all that matters. The shooting is awkward. There are only a few types of vampires and they also share very few models. 

The game itself is buggy. Controls randomly stop working, menu elements get stuck on screen. You can't pause when playing singleplayer. I really wanted to like Redfall, but it's such a chore to play that I'm not going to continue.

Redfall,1294810,138389132,"A lot of ink's been spilled over this game already, so I'm going to write about a couple specific reasons why I don't recommend it, at least at its $70 face value. Before diving in, I want to say the graphical issues haven't really bothered me. The art style is very Arkane, and if you like the look of the DIshonored games, you'll like the look of this one.

First and foremost, this game is most like Borderlands, but unlike Borderlands, lacks for variety in its gameplay. Go to a slightly different area of town, shoot the same 10 bad guy models, of which there are 3 variations (SMG guy, shotgun guy, sniper guy), hope for loot. Instead of weaponry exploding everywhere, maybe a bag with some loot in it drops.

Which leads to the second big issue with variety. If it's going to be a co-op loot shooter, the loot and gun play needs to feel great. The UV gun is hilariously fun against vampires, but overall there's a maybe 15-weapon pool, and not a lot of diversity in that pool. However, that's not the most infuriating aspect. That award goes to silencers, which actually work and give you stealth, but there's no way to tell if a gun has one unless you equip the weapon, and you can't add them on later! Not to mention shooting just doesn't feel very tight. You'll line up a headshot with a sniper rifle (with no stabilize button, btw. Come on, it's 2023, and my character is THE SNIPER GUY), and it'll whiff by a foot. You can't tell if it's you, the game, or both.

I have primarily been playing this game in co-op with a friend on Gamepass. The multiplayer is...decent, if I'm being generous? The game certainly feels better with friends, but is hamstrung by bugs, missions hard-locking if your friend takes some actions, etc. Even more annoyingly, there's no drop-in, drop-out element. If your friend DC's, your session terminates and you're back to main menu. Friends can't join on you either--they have to be invited to your session.

What's most upsetting though is that this is a game I actually wanted to like, and just...struggle to find positive things to say about. If my buddy isn't available, it just lives in my library gathering dust. It feels like even after the long delay, this game still walked out the front door feeling unpolished.",False,111,1656

Redfall,1294810,138378682,"Redfall, very clearly, has been received poorly, however I don't believe the game is as bad as most are describing.  You have the obligatory performance issues on random rigs, some AI Jank that can easily be patched, the normal kinds of bugs that you find in an open world like this which can also be patched, etc.  Nothing I would consider game breaking or detrimental to the game, its no Cyberpunk or Darktide release.

The storyline seems meh so far and the world does seem empty..especially in this day and age where we're so used to open world games having literally 20 things to do around each corner.  Maybe this is a good thing, maybe it's not...that's yet to be seen by me. The graphics seem nice, though I think the flashligh is a bit flat and lack luster.  The combat unfortunately is mediocre at best, but perhaps that's just the character I'm currently playing I plan on trying others when I find the time (Grown up life, am I right?).  I have, unfortunately, not been able to play with anyone as no one wants to buy the game with the bad press it's getting so I don't have any idea how the multiplayer is.  

I've experienced some bugs, the biggest and most annoying one for me is enemies will just suddenly stop registering damage and I'll have to stop firing and start again for it to start doing damage again.  It's not me missing or anything like that, they just simply stop taking damage and it appears to be random so it's not anything I can easily reproduce from what I've seen.  For the most part my game play has been unbugged and the game runs well on my Ryzen 3950x and 3090 Ti at  5120x1440.

My issues with the game are mostly the sort of things that have been included to facilitate multiplayer. The lack of pausing and saving in single player mode for example.

Redfall,1294810,138349193,"TL;DR - Can I recommend this game? Having finished it with a friend on the 3rd (of four) hardest difficulty, I guess the answer is no. 
It is good, in places. It's fun, in places. But if I recommended it to a friend, I'd inevitably feel embarrassed at all the bugs and poor design choices made by the devs. 

Redfall is a game that really needed another year or so of development to realise it's true potential. It's closest to a looter-shooter, sort of like a Borderlands game, but truly open world. It's got two maps that admittedly aren't huge, but you can freely sprint from one side of the map to the other with no loading screens. 
It's full of that Arkane style we all know and love, but at times it does feel empty. Big areas with no enemies that you just skip over heading to the next waypoint. Lots of scattered journals with lore dumps that you are mostly going to skip over and ignore.

The game works as follows: You quickly make your way to the quest hub and pick up a main quest and perhaps a side mission and head out into the world to complete it. Rinse and repeat. They are either fetch quests or kill quests. There are a handful of quick travel points spread across the map, as well as half a dozen safehouses too. The safehouses need to be unlocked, and each have first a quest to complete (one of four types), and then ""kill a mini-boss"" quest to complete. The safehouse unlocks are required to complete the main story. After you have done the main quests, you defeat the map's boss. Then you move on to map 2 and do it all again.
The loot is quite generic and has a level stat and a quality level. It's not that easy to work out when a weapon with level X is better than a lower level weapon with a better quality, other than 'are numbers bigger ok i pick this one'.

All together these features would make the game acceptable. But what really let's the game design are the cutscenes and AI. 
Firstly the AI is quite basic. Vampires will always teleport and charge you. By backing away and jumping you can usually completely avoid their attacks. The human enemies have that fun feature of once you're spotted, everybody knows exactly where you are instantly. Retreat and hide and reposition, it doesn't matter. They still know where you are. And obviously there have been multiple instances of enemies standing still and glaring at you and doing nothing, seemingly unable to attack.
Secondly the cutscenes. They have clearly been done quickly and spat out. There's no character animation. You're basically watching a comic strip of images with a narrator over the top. Even the few in game ones that you watch (past memories of bosses giving us story exposition) are with static models, very similar to the game Tacoma (an indie game with approx. 4-10 devs). It feels rushed and half-hearted.

Slap on top a plethora of bugs like weapon glitches, unable to melee/stake enemies, T-poses, graphical oddities, a weird one where I slid down some stairs and carried on across the map and turning my vision upside-down, disconnects and the inability to reconnect to any game in progress, fps drops, makes this a poor poor recommendation.

Redfall,1294810,138315623,"This is not a great game. 

Even if everything worked, I would have difficulty calling [i]Redfall[/i] a good game.

But I wanted to give it a thumbs up anyway. Partially because I find the hate bandwagon surrounding this game distasteful. I loathe the hyperbole in the negative reviews. I've played worse. A lot worse. I played [i]Fallout 76[/i] on release. 

[i]Redfall[/i] is not a terrible game. It is... aggressively mediocre.

[i]Redfall[/i] does not feel or play like an Arkane game. It is painful to reconcile that this came from the studio that gave us [i]Dishonored, Prey[/i] and [i]Deathloop[/i]. But it [i]does[/i] feel like a Bethesda game. It feels appropriate for a studio trying to pick itself up after the trainwreck (of a train carrying dumpsters, all of which were on fire) that was [i]Fallout 76[/i] and deliver something that's not half-bad.

The open world is well-made. The island of Redfall is fun to explore and have firefights in. The graphics are usually solid, with some occasional greatness. The characters are conceptually unique and fun.

Sadly, the story could be a lot better. I found myself daydreaming of better stories for the game. Worse, the lore is dull. The bits that aren't related to the vampire apocalypse don't flesh out the world in any interesting way. The bits that are about the ongoing horror rarely provoke empathy and never offer intrigue. 

An example of a particularly bad offender is one of the first notes you find: ""Fear"". The note is a father saying how his wife and baby are staying behind in a shipping crate while he goes out for supplies. He asks how so many normally good people could become cultists for monsters, and tells us the answer is fear. The note isn't written to anyone in particular and has no reason to have been written at all. The father isn't asking for help or pleading for his family or railing at the enemy. There is no quest attached, no exploration it points to. The note is in the cargo container it talks about, and everyone is there dead (except the devs aren't going to show us a dead baby). Worse, the note points out something bizarre, something [i]mysterious[/i], and then tells us there isn't a mystery here and the explanation is as banal and cursory as possible. It reads like the devs telling us not to bother looking beyond the surface level for narrative content.

Still, I had a lot of fun running around the world with my best friend, shooting vampires and cultists as we set up safehouses and stalked the vampire ""gods"" that rule the island.

And there were moments of brilliance. I won't spoil with an example as they are few and precious. But those moments told me the kind of game this could have been. And should have been.

I would have given this a thumbs up despite so many lackluster elements, but the game has bugs and issues that just started to sap the fun I had found in it. 

Monsters scale to your level, so those bigger damage numbers never feel meaningful. To the contrary, I find myself avoiding combat because I didn't want to level. Leveling just meant that the guns I found which I liked would lose their effectiveness. Sure, it meant I also got skill points, but that brings us to other problems.

The characters are not well balanced. And even when their powers work right, some of them are too situational or limited to be desirable. While Devinder's teleporter is beyond amazing, Layla's elevator is clunky to use and drastically less versatile. And I seriously question the mindset of the devs who decided that a powerful female character's ultimate power should be having a man come and save her. Honestly, that feels gross.

I mostly played Jacob, whose power set seemed custom-made for me. Except of his powers, only the invisibility cloak worked properly. The scouting raven was a crapshoot at best who would regularly fail to notice enemies I could directly see and whose damaging ability procced once in a blue moon. Likewise, by the time we reached Burial Point, the ""powerful"" headshots that his ultimate was supposed to supply regularly did almost no damage. The ultimate became a liability, locking me out of using effective weapons whenever the spectral sniper rifle decided it wanted to be a nerf gun. Beyond invisibility, Jacob's best and most reliable ability was the special skill of carrying more lockpicks and rewire kits. And even that had an issue: when starting or joining a game, any ammo or supplies carried above the amount allowed without skills would often be lost as the game applied your skills after loading your inventory.

My best friend and I will likely finish the game together. I have no desire to continue to play solo. Nor will I return to it after we finish. 

The game is not worth full price, but I can still recommend it on deep discount if you have someone to play it with. Just don't expect an Arkane game. Expect a fairly fun if generic looter-shooter with a vampire theme.",False,212,6506

This was an AMAZING idea that was poorly executed, I'm sure we'll hear many reasons why the devs didnt do this or that and left things unfinished or unpolished but frankly at this stage, without continued support (that they are unlikely to put in) this was a TERRIBLE execution of what could have been a monumental franchise starter.

the open world is a EMPTY shell of a world. there is nothing out there i promise you. unless a side quest or main quest brings you somewhere don't bother exploring even the extra lore from books and notes is horrendous and so lack luster.

Redfall,1294810,138225459,"I would give this game 7/10, and this review will be a little ""long"" due to that rating. 

I really like this game, it's a lot of fun, I also don't really have any performance issues, it works as it should. I gotten two bugs so far, that isn't game breaking, and that's two different vampires just floating in the air, but don't get damaged when you attack them. But other than that, it's a lot of fun. I like the different types of vampires, I like the different kind of cultists and the story itself. How there's multiple but divided main quests, some fun sidequests, helping the neighbourhoods to make sure the safe houses are actually safe. I haven't tried it out co-op yet, but it's still a lot of fun to play solo as well. 

But I got some things I need to mention that brings it down for me, enough to not give it a higher rating. Ideas that could maybe, be fixed, or not. I don't know. It's more or less just nitpicking from my side.
1. The nests respawns. Which doesn't make any sense if you think about it. You help out in the different neighbourhoods, and then cleanse the nest to get rid of .. well. The nests. So for me it doesn't make sense that all the sudden there's a new one that spawn almost on the exactly spot you already cleanse. It's an annoying grind.
2. You can't pause the game when you are playing solo. I get why, but it's still an annoying factor. I understand you can't do that when you are playing with others, but when you are playing solo. Nah. I don't like that. They should have done like Sons of the Forest.
3. This is just a nitpicking point for me, but maybe other likes it. But you can't upgrade your weapons. So you get this amazing legendary weapon. You level up. Find better weapons but not good in the extras thingies, and have to leave that legendary weapon behind. I don't like that, I wish to be able to upgrade my already good weapons in damage, and level. Use the currency you have in the game to be able to do that. Just, something.

Now... it's pretty fucking unforgivable to have a shitty mouse sensitivity bar that only counts in integers, some people like me like shooters very much and like their sensitivity to be VERY precise, if not i will feel uncomfortable and generally have a worse time playing, but it even more unforgivable to NOT have a ADS Mouse sensitivity multiplier! WHY !? ADS-ing in this game is pretty shit, they put an arbitrary multiplier and, at least for me, is pretty fucking slow, i hate it.

Now, from Jr Dev to Dev studio:
- Change the hit detector and pathfinding on the vampire, you can get them stuck in stuff like cars, they think they can hit you but there is a car in between so they do not hit you, and since they think they can hit you, they just don't go around the object in between, ez kill stupid vampire, how does this made it past play testing?

- For the human enemies, they feel like they shoot randomly and barely hit anything, but when they do, they generally hit fairly hard, i'd rather have them hit me more often and less hard, it would make the player feel ""overwhelmed"", forcing me to take cover, because, OH BOY i do NOT take cover i just run to them and overwhelm them myself, i know they will miss most of their shots, so i am pretty much able to take out a group of 4-5 without much trouble.

- And lastly the games, a lot of times, and in boss fights, feels very tailored to 1 or maybe 2 players, underbosses have very little health, even though they are ""special"" and the main bosses are the same, 2 of my friends and i killed the first mayor boss very easily, felt very very anticlimatic, specially since he had a ""super villian"" origin and was supposed to be very powerfull, i didn't even noticed if the boss did any special attacks or anything... having said that, the 3-4 times that my friends and i have actually all died was because the game decided to spawn about 10 vampires and another 10 humans and... well vampires hit often and hit very hard (the pathfinding idiocy i described earlier is barely present with friends, since they chance target).

As for the length i am 19 hours in and i haven't finished it, whoever says it's a 10 hour game either speed ran this bitch, or is just lying, as any open world, take your time, read stuff, do side missions, have fun.

I do not like that it is quite broken and feels more like an early access, but the game itself is quite fun, hopefully they will not abandon it soon, hopefully more content and fixes will come because it's fun, it's just not finished.

This release did Arkane very bad, Arkane Lyon has done an amazing job with their games. 
Actually i would've wished they made this game with Void Engine and not UE4...

Redfall,1294810,138219191,"4/10.  This was a baffling game.  

On one hand the story and voice acting were intriguing and engaging.  I enjoyed learning about the main story through a well thought out combination of in-game notes, voice recordings, and in-game  ""psychic flashbacks.""  Reminded me a bit of FEAR where you're trying to figure out what caused this, who the mysterious cast of characters are, what are their backstories, etc.  

On the other hand, the open world gameplay is barren of enemies and the enemy AI that is around is just plain awful.  It's downright embarrassing for a AAA game that was $70.  For much of the game you are just walking around between the town and coming across set pieces where you think, ""this would be fun to fight around if there were enemies,"" but they're nowhere to be seen.  There's also a ridiculous amount of bugs.  Enemies that are stuck standing still, enemies that are there moving around but can't be attacked, loading to black screens where other players can see you but you can't move, killed enemies falling through the floor so you can't loot them.  

Bottom line, don't buy this game for anything more than $20.  Maybe ever.  Even if they fixed the bugs I think the core problems with enemy AI may be too much to overcome.

The graphics are nothing to complain about on my 3070 i9 and actually pretty appealing in my opinion... They did a good job on content between missions and side missions and boss fights.

Neutral comments:
Environment is non interactive. Car windows do not smash out, tires do not go flat. Doors do not change with damage. 
The only executions are staking vampires.

Pro:
Gun play is fun and satisfying for me,
Characters are pretty cool.
Straightforward gameplay makes it quick for me to get the handle of.
Music is actually pretty good, I usually mute the music but this one i keep on.
Vampire enemies teleport short distances causing me to miss shots and keep mobile to avoid getting mobbed down.

Cons:
Enemies arent very challenging on Medium difficulty. Minions tend to miss their shots if they are about 30-40 feet away even when you are standing still, though enemy snipers havent missed me yet.
Vampires can be encountered rarely during the daytime. While they react to the UV spotlights, they do not react to direct sunlight.
Vampire pathing doesnt let them climb things to chase you and their attacks are easy to dodge.
Vampires are mostly a threat when there are 4 or 5 of them.

What I want to see in coming updates:
Enemies need a buff in both AI, Accuracy, and Attack speed.
Something to help the framerate drop in new areas.
Maybe a vampire mode? Where you get to play as a vampire and take over the map and kill rival vampires?

I've got special abilities - I don't  need any of them on the hardest difficulty.

I stand beneath a giant, frozen-in time tidal-wave: there's something off, though...The shadows make no sense, shadows are cast on objects that aren't consistent with their position to the light sources.

A vampire tells me I'll never see the sun again as we stand in a sunny street.

My friend doesn't walk, and neither do I: most of the time we simply *slide* when we're not half in the ground. Redfall thought it had a problem with Vampires, but it's really the gun-toting psychic mole people.

I return to my special Firehouse to find the NPCs all T-posing. Often, there are duplicates of them. The priest - who I think is a man every time I look at her - has a clone. This clone has ascended to Godhood: her head IS a light source.

There's a story. The kind've story where a greasy, slick corporate representative walks up to you with a skateboard and their hat on backwards and says ""Hello, fellow kids,"" or Hillary Clinton tries to convince you she's not a bearded-dragon wearing a human-suit by telling you cute anecdotes about how she has hot sauce in her purse.

There are games with this same formula more than a decade old, with a lesser budget, that work better than this game. Everything feels wrong: the walking, the gun play, the vertical tool tips that take up a quarter or more of your screen in combat and require you to hold a key for several seconds to dismiss them. It's almost like Redfall got very cursory play testing. I can't blame Bethesda though: Fallout 76 ended up being successful, so why wouldn't this? Why bother releasing games in finished states when you can just push them out like an unripened turd and still have people buy it. 

Thank God Phil Spencer apologised for the state of this game, because that really makes up for this being pushed out. Someone cue up the clip of the BP Oil CEO saying ""I'm sorry"" that South Park did a few years ago.

The only thing Redfall got right is that it has an ""uninstall"", but you could argue it's deadliest flaw is letting you install it to begin with.

Edit to initial review:

It has been a month since this game released. I posted my initial review with a recommend with the belief that the dev team would take immediate action to rectify some of their most glaring mistakes and to fix the game breaking bugs that have undermining playing the game (I am still experiencing post-hotfix crashes upon loading in). Since release, I have seen no news from devs regarding a game plan for fixing the obvious bugs and glitches that we have all experienced. There has also been no word on how they are planning to move forward from this disaster launch. This is beyond disappointing given the public failure and the fairly vocal admissions from the dev team that this game was a train wreck throughout its development. 

To have no plan, no major fixes, and no promise of delivering on at least some semblance of the quality that was promised after a month is pitiful. I am not feeling hopeful that they are going to take responsibility for fixing this game, so I am changing to not recommending under any circumstances. You can read my initial review if you want to see what I was hoping for, but this is where I stand now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, I have very mixed feelings about this game:
Initial/Current Cons:
-World feels empty (lacks mobs, can't enter most buildings, small maps)
-Story is boring and lacks clear immersive plot (lack of cutscenes cinematics, lack of clear main plot purpose, not many quests and they don't build plot lines)
-Buggy (originally just the stuttering and freezing, now game breaking constant crashes after hotfix)
-NOT ENOUGH CONTENT/QUALITY TO JUSTIFY PRICE TAG 

This last one hurts. It feels like a betrayal of the community for putting faith in them to at least provide us with the most basic, minimum standard that a games plot line and core building blocks used to demand. I understand inflation plays a role in this price jump, but that Microsoft pushed this, and then by their own admission failed to invest the  resources into this game necessary to bring it up to promised standards simply because it was already under way is a slap in the face. With gamers now facing these kinds of price tags and receiving quality and content quantity of this level, it destroys trust and studios are going to be facing these opening week severe review bombs and backlash for it.

Now, I said I had mixed feelings about this game. When I initially started playing, I came in biased. I impulse bought the game the day before it released despite telling myself to hold back and wait to see reviews. Before I could play, floods of negative reviews came in regarding quality and content, which killed my initial disposition towards the game. These reviews were accurate and my initial start was buggy and empty (cons above). I asked for refund, but missed the 2 hour cut off by a few minutes (take that as you will). I decided to invest in the game a bit more, restart, change the graphics based on posts to reduce stutters, and upped the difficulty as far as I could (Midnight). Here is what I found when I put a few more hours into the game:

Potential Pros:
-As you progress slightly past the initial fights and quests, it seems like you get a higher spawn rate of elite vampires that spice up combat (combat AI and spawn rates still need improvement)
-Once the initial stuttering was fixed with graphic/video changes, game was largely playable (Still lacks dynamic fighting that this kind of close quarters vampire combat game should have - I still feel like I walk into battle, would prefer to need to run, parkour, and have higher level of melee given what we fight)

This does not appear to be much in the way of pros, but I think that these are core issues that would have likely improved dispositions towards the game and could leave people with a better opinion later when this game gets needed patches and eventually (at this rate soon) goes on sale. There are still severe core issues that probably are unfixable now that the game has launched, but for what it is, if these elements are fixed, they will get a reasonable following. The game should not have ever been hyped to the extent that it was nor been the roll out game for a new pricing regime. These are company mistakes that Microsoft and the studio should learn from. If the game had improved difficulty and combat by drawing from recent games like Dying Light 2 and even Cyberpunk (I know its a sore spot but the core game mechanics were interesting and it had a decent plot), this game could have been decent in my opinion.

I am recommending this game purely under a condition that they invest time into actually fixing issues that are within their power to fix. There is no reason to believe there will be a full plot overhaul (at this point simply implementation) and integration of more dynamic combat and open world mechanics to the extent of the examples above. 

I also do not recommend buying this game at current list price at any time. Honestly, you should wait 4-6 months before even looking at this game, then wait for a 50-75% off sale. However, I choose to have faith that by then the studio will have found a direction to work towards and salvage the game in part.

When I heard they were releasing a co-op shooter, I thought it was a strange move, but they would knock it out of the park like they'd done with their previous games. But everything about this experience is a failure. 
The world and story are lifeless and bland, with little to know meaningful environmental storytelling like you'd find in Prey or Dishonoured. Enemy AI is atrocious, with absolutely no intelligence behind their combat or movement. The gameplay is clunky and overall just feels off to play. And to tie it all together, performance is abysmal. The worst though is that the game is just plain bad though, disregarding the functionality and performance, there is nothing endearing or enjoyable here, no personality or identity, it's lifeless.

Redfall,1294810,138105429,"Redfall is an open world FPS featuring both single player and co-op modes. Starting the game, you can choose between four playable characters, each one with their unique abilities. The game is set in the town of Redfall (Massachusetts, US) during a vampire apocalypse that blocked the sun and caused the waters to recede. As one of the few remaining survivors, you will fight against multiple vampire Lords while investigating their appearance and trying to break the island’s curse. Unlike zombies, there aren’t many games featuring vampires, so it certainly feels refreshing to play one (while we patiently wait for [i]VTM Bloodlines 2[/i]). The setting often reminded me of [i]Salem’s Lot[/i] and the more recent [i]Midnight Mass[/i], which I love. Unfortunately, the story of Redfall is not engaging due to the lack of interesting secondary characters & antagonists. Cutscenes are like cheap static images from a storyboard showing how the real cutscenes should have been, if they were really made. I can’t understand how they let this happen and, considering the AAA increased price, this is totally unacceptable. Main quests are decent enough thanks to the variety of locations, while secondary ones are the classic “go there and find this item” or “go there and kill this enemy”. Keep in mind that completing some secondary quests is also mandatory for unlocking the final main quest, in case you are thinking of simply rushing through the story. You can’t replay any completed quest, so right now some achievements can only be obtained if you make one or two more playthroughs or if you are lucky enough to play the same mission differently through co-op.

The gunplay has been improved thanks to the collaboration with ID Software. While still not perfect, it feels smoother than any previous Arkane game. There is decent variety in weapons too, ranging from pistols and shotguns to flareguns and stake launchers. Each weapon can be customized with different skins and has a level or rarity in the following order: white, green, blue, purple and orange. Unfortunately, you won’t find any unique weapons and you will often swap between the same ones with different levels. For some weird reason there are no throwables, such as grenades or molotov. The game’s tutorial tells you that stealth is also an option, yet it feels really bad, like there isn’t even an animation for the silent takedown and you just punch human enemies in the back hoping they will instantly die (sometimes they don’t). Enemies are not very varied and you will often fight vampires, gangs of human cultists and mercenary soldiers, who also tend to fight each other. Their AI is one of the worst I have ever seen and completely ruins the combat experience. Enemies often stand still and stare at you or look in the wrong direction even when you are shooting at them; they have incredibly slow reaction times so you can kill them easily. Even the final bosses are affected, with Jacob’s invisibility power capable of breaking their AI as it continuously swaps between normal mode and combat mode.

If you played [i]Dishonored[/i], [i]Prey[/i] or [i]Deathloop[/i], you know that level design is what Arkane makes best. Redfall’s environments are fascinating to explore, buildings can be accessed in multiple ways, interiors are greatly detailed, particularly the ones connected to main missions. Level design is what kept me playing the game, wanting to know what I could find inside the lighthouse I saw from the distance, inside a hidden cave or a giant mansion heavily guarded. It’s a pity that the rest of the game doesn’t have the same quality. While Arkane said the game was perfectly playable as a single player (and that is true), the experience is built around co-op, so it’s not really much fun alone. Characters are meant to compensate each other and while playing as Jacob, who is a stealth hero with the abilities of detecting enemies behind walls, becoming invisible for a short time and instantly sniping everyone, I realized I could use some more offensive abilities to make combat more varied and engaging. Despite being alone, characters and enemies often refer to you as a group of people, fast travelling starts a 5-second countdown, missions must be accepted in a briefing room so you must always fast travel to your HQ to start them. All this was clearly designed for co-op, yet for some reason there is no public matchmaking, meaning you need to have friends who are willing to spend this amount of money to buy the game and invite them to your lobby. Even then, only the host maintains the story progression while the other players can only keep the experience and gear collected, so when they return to their world they must play the story missions again. I think this was a terrible mistake and that Arkane should have just copied [i]Borderlands[/i], where you can join public lobbies and skip missions already completed on someone else’s playthrough. Another horrible thing is that even when playing alone the game constantly needs an online connection. If for any reason you lose it for one second, you will get kicked and lose any unsaved progress. This is unacceptable, if I’m playing alone there should be no reason to stop me from going offline.

Technically speaking, the game is plagued by many problems: textures not loading or taking too long to load, enemies glitching inside walls or suddenly spawning close to you, enemies walking backwards, objects floating mid-air, dead bodies changing their position, hero t-posing in the character menu, crouch and start button no longer working (on controller), parts of the world feeling empty and much more. It seems like the game was heavily rushed for release, which is also visible with the poor performance. It doesn’t matter what settings you change, you won’t notice any frame-rate difference but you will often get frame drops that will ruin your experience. The game also includes Denuvo anti-tamper, which may be the cause of some problems.

The always-online requirement must be removed, online matchmaking must be added, the co-op progression must be expanded, and the optimization must be improved.

Redfall,1294810,138076726,"Some of you might’ve thought I was silly for giving Redfall a positive review when it first came out — especially with its original price tag. But I didn’t just judge it by launch day. I looked ahead, saw the potential, and I’m proud to say I still stand by that decision. And now? I’m SO proud they changed the game price — a big step in the right direction.

Let’s talk positives first:
Redfall nails multiplayer and interaction. It’s got that classic co-op magic — from hoarding loot and exploring every corner of the map to laughing at weird glitches or strategizing through chaotic fights. The story is strong, with a sort of retro Left 4 Dead vibe and killer cutscenes that feel like they belong in a comic book. There are tons of skins for characters and weapons, multiple difficulty levels, and a satisfying level-up and ability system. No two characters or enemies feel the same, and I love how you’re constantly stumbling into random encounters around the map. The combat even lets you shoot while downed (which saves lives more than you’d think), and characters have unique voice lines that make them feel alive. You can dodge attacks, and yes — sliddeee.

Now the not-so-great stuff:
The original pricing was definitely rough, and only one save slot per person is really limiting, especially when you want to restart a character. Some guns can’t be accessorized (missed opportunity), and the intro screen is not only boring — it’s loud. There's lag in some areas, which will likely be fixed in time, and it’s a little annoying that you have to check the missions tab to see if something is complete. I also really wish we could decorate the safe house — there’s so much potential there. And for my Remi mains: it would be awesome if her launch pads could double as explosives.

Graphics-wise, if you like that gritty, stylized retro vibe from Left 4 Dead, this is your lane. And while the story already brings a lot to the table (with a few light puzzles), I’d love to see even more side quests you discover naturally instead of everything starting at your safe place.",True,6,2420

Some changes with recent patches have improved enemy AI to a degree; there is considerably less jank when interacting with enemies in that they are not animation-locked anymore.

----


For starters, I have been playing this on the Steam Deck with minimal issues, aside from a few crashes.

Look, I'll be honest with you: a lot of the negative comments and the criticism is absolutely founded. For example, the game shipped out with buggy AI, capped FPS that still stutters, a talent tree that cannot be respec'd, and a whole host of issues.

Having said this, I've still found some entertaining gameplay value in this title. For example, the stealth mechanics are barebones but still make for some interesting combat options. The gunplay and the mechanics of the guns feels great but it's mired by an odd UI inventory system; there are moment of genuine eeriness when haunting voices coming from another room chant ""the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood"", but after a couple of hours, it gets stale.

I am hoping that this game will get better because it's too late for a refund, so I suppose the TLDR: absolutely avoid this game until it's deeply discounted.",False,6,1295

Hollywood thinks very lowly of it's audience. I like Nicholas Cage but other than a cliched silly Dracula with too much gore makeup and bad teeth, he adds very little here. Nicholas Hoult is the sympathetic guilty-victim. His part is thin with a very silly superpower boost. There's implied depth to his character but nothing of any substance in the script.

PROS

Good atmosphere
Good soundtrack 
Solid story, I liked the ending
Combat is solid
Staking vampires is incredibly satisfying, does not get old. 


CONS

A number of strange and just plain dumb design choices. The world is open, but not really. You have to be on the specific missions for things like keys to spawn. There's no real point in exploring if you arent on the correct mission.
There are two maps, but after you finish the first one, you can't go back. When you finish the final mission, the game ends and you are forced to do NG+. You cannot go back for side missions or collectibles.
The collectibles are ridiculously tedious. They are very well hidden and you cannot track them.
The talent tree has tiers, you have to save points for higher levels so you end up saving a lot of points. 
The AI gets stuck on things and is pretty dumb in general.
Why are lock picks limited? Why is not just an unlocking mini game? 

Overall, fun if you like the core gameplay loop but very rough. Certainly not worth $70. 6.5/10",False,4,1682
Redfall,1294810,138068147,DEV FIX THIS GAME BECAUSE I PAID 100 EURO FOR THIS GAME AND THE REFUND DOESN'T WORK.,False,5,3540
Redfall,1294810,138067779,"[b]Short answer:[/b] If the game piques your interest, then get it on deep sale. I had a decent amount of fun with it at times, but I can't picture even a fully-patched [i]and[/i] enhanced version of this game that is worth its $70 price tag. The price is pretty insulting in its launch state.

[b]Long answer:[/b] There's a decent shooter here buried beneath a mountain of bugs, an uninteresting story, and some questionable design decisions.

The guns are pretty satisfying in both sound and feel, and their power generally feels significant so long as you keep up with the looter shooter grind by replacing your favorites frequently with their higher-numbered counterparts. Think Borderlands with a much more conservative number of items to sift through. I appreciate the streamlining. The game is also generally good at providing a decent number of fast travel points, preventing the fatigue of running all the way across a zone.

But that's where the good stuff ends for me. That traversal is actually slowed greatly by red mist scattered generously throughout the map, and which can only be eliminated (temporarily) by shooting a target with a specific weapon type--one which you may not generally bother having equipped. You'll either have to open the cumbersome menu to swap out weapons in one of your (extremely conservative) three slots, or use one of a few of the characters' traversal mechanics on a very long cooldown in order to bypass the red mist. By the way, the game [i]doesn't[/i] pause when you're in menus, even when you're playing solo. (I understand the developers are supposed to be working on an offline mode that I assume will actually behave like a proper single-player game, but it is not ready as of the time I'm reviewing it.)

Beyond the frustrations of movement, there are numerous game-breaking bugs. You will find progress thwarted by immortal enemies or key items falling outside of reachable space. You might get booted from the game even when playing alone because you lost connection to a server. These are things that can theoretically be patched, but the rate of development being done on the game post-launch is (so far) not encouraging, so I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for fixes.

Even if you somehow dodge bugs, you'll be faced with a predictable, fairly boring story accompanied by uninteresting fetch quests that clearly try to tug at your heart strings. And speaking of fetch quests, you'll often find yourself having to scour every inch of a building to find the magic collection of pixels representing an item you need to progress. At times, it's infuriating.

Redfall will waste your time in numerous ways. There's some decent combat with some heavily-repeated enemy types in there, but the story is unremarkable and the map is somehow even more frustrating to traverse than Borderlands' open, empty spaces (on top of having plenty emptiness of its own).",False,5,761

I was awaiting this game because I'm easy to please when it comes to vampire games, and had planned to play it with a friend. While I had fun with my friend, this is not really difficult : having fun when playing coop is dumb easy, as long as there is a vague gameplay.

Still, the fun I had killing enemies with terrible AI doesn't make the flaws of the game less apparent. But the real shame is that it could have been so much better. There are ideas beneath the pile of blandness. The bits in ""memories"" have interesting visuals, for instance, that hint at environments that could have been spectacular to play through. Some skills are somewhat amusing to use.

But... this just doesn't come close to being enough. Also, the storytelling is terrible : why so much text, in my fast action-paced shooter ? Who's got time to read tons of diary entries or letters ? Why do the memories kill the pace so much too ?

The enemies : not very varied. Four or five types of vampires, and cultists that all act the same (shoot you), and they take a crazy long time to react to having you in front of them.

We played in highest difficulty and took less than 12 hours to finish, while doing all the side quests we found on our way and liberating all safehouses we found.

All the time I found myself comparing this game with another, far superior ""Coop FPS with set characters and quests"" : Borderlands. And Borderlands is better in all regards :
- Fun, varied weapons
- Varied builds
- Amusing quests
- Entertaining dialogs
- Broad type of enemies

Bad first, the performance is trash. for how it looks, this should not stutter and drop FPS as much as it does. 
A lot of people here complain about the game being empty and the AI being dumb and yes, the AI is absolutely lobotomised. Some simple changes to normal enemy behaviour, such as seeking cover, reacting to allies dying and faux flanking would give them a lot more life. I always liked how the AI in the Division 2 functioned in their open world.
The vampires are fine. They jump around chaotically and hit you. 

I actually like that the town of Redfall is largely abandoned. Its creepy. A few more random events here and there, aside from faction encounters could be fun though. Again, a lot can be taken from the Division 2 playbook. D2 was formulaic, but full of stuff to do.

The artstyle and the athmosphere work great together. If the environment was a bit more dynamic, with rain, wind or even storms, it would elevate the experience even more. I love the vampires. They are always gloating, they wear high collars and have slicked back hair. The fact that you have to stake them to kill them. Just great. Even the human factions are kinda interesting, but they don't really function differently. Cultists have poison grenades and PMCs have turrets. Thats pretty much it.  
Guns are strange. The animations and sounds are serviceable, even cool sometimes, but aiming feels... swimmy? Might be my settings though.

So me personally, I can spend a lot of time in this game. It works for me, even if its absolutely halfbaked. I can definitely understand a lot of the negative feedback, but this game can still be repaired, if technical fixes and additions to content can be expected.",False,0,2208
Redfall,1294810,138039314,"It's good fun, don't believe the anti-hype. 

The art is GLORIOUS and the world-building is thick and rich. The playable characters interact with one another in an organic fashion, and have charming conversations. There's a metroidvania feel to exploring the world of Redfall, as you unlock various areas and become strong enough to go to new places and face new enemies.

Certainly not without its issues currently. The combat feels a bit stiff, and mouse aiming can feel sluggish when switching to it from other games. The ability to collect items and notes can be hampered or delayed at times. The player skills and powers are a bit lacklustre for now, and thus can be easy to forget.

Recommended to enjoy the game with your usual co-opmates, don't take it too seriously. It's not L4D, but it's not meant to be. It's an open world vampire-killing exploration story, with spiritual references to a bunch of games, and pure Arkane blood running through its veins.

Reccomended also to let them iron out some bugs, tighten up the meta, and tweak the performance before you pass your final judgement. Currently it's not AAA but it definitely has the potential, and I have strong faith that it will get to where it should be after a few patch cycles. 

Remember the Bethesda bug curse, and the pandemic that knocked a lot of projects around.

I like how the story is being told so far through not just the story line missions but also through other means found while exploring. For myself the game looks and sounds great with the exception of the occasional FPS stuttering. It does have a few issues that I feel need some attention. First and foremost is the enemy AI. About 30% of the encounters I have had feel very fluid and action packed. While the other 70% of encounters have felt like I am either playing Whack-a-Mole or red light, green light with the enemy. They will just stand there for 3-6 seconds and look at you. Once you start shooting them, they might start looking confused and walking around like Pres. Biden trying to leave a stage or they may just stand there and take their death.  My second issue is the lack of match making. I can't really understand how that was never implemented to start with as it is pretty standard for today's games. I don't just friend everyone that I come into contact with while gaming. So with a smaller group of friends, getting a group together is kind of a pain in the butt. Hence the reason I haven't spoken to how any of the group game play feels.

Not a complaint just a observation. As for the AI , people have complained about it but i have had enemies take a hit and seek cover, Vamps shade step around my arc lance ( Devinder ) to dodge it, the AI seems solid at some points and basic at others, Definitely not the glass lickers other reviews have suggested but still open for improvement. The gunplay is rather nice, I would have liked some gun modding as an option, but the fact that i can loot the same gun and get three different scopes, and 3 different sets of perks is kinda nice, i haven't experienced the hit registration issue others have mentioned,  that could be a latency issue on their end. As for difficulty , the first region of the game felt a little easy even on midnight (second highest difficulty ), but once i got to the next region the entire difficulty dynamic shifted and i am considering adjusting it back down to normal, haven't yet , i enjoy the challenge. Overall  this game feels like it has ALOT of potential, i am enjoying it, I will NOT recommend that anyone with a older system pick it up atm , from what i have read you will be forced to play on low settings and may end up still being annoyed, but if you have a newer system and enjoy looter shooters, definitely recommend. hope to see more dlc and improvements in the near future.",True,4,2294

You advertised a false product and gave everyone an empty world. Needless to say, I won't be supporting early development of your games for a while.

My brother, bless him, picked up on this and offered to play the games I wanted to FOR me while i sat behind him in my wheelchair and watched. With tears in my eyes i agreed and i have been playing vicariously through him ever since. When Redfall was announced we both became super hyped and i couldn't wait to watch him play it. After pre-ordering it and waiting about 3 weeks the wait was almost over. He pre-loaded the game and after 2 more excruciating days of waiting we finally got to play it. He wheeled me into my favourite spot just behind my old computer chair loaded it up and selected our character. After watching him play for 4 agonizing hours i couldn't take it anymore, with the holy will of God himself i screamed internally at my muscles to obey me, I just needed them this one last time, I had to make it stop.

Not knowing how long this divine power would last i shoved my brother aside and desperately fumbled with the mouse and keyboard to write a refund request.

Its a soulless game. The story is unintresting, the world is empty and my god is the AI dumb...

Pro's:
-The looting system isn't half bad.
Thats it really

Cons:
- Very boring and unintresting story.
- The 4 characters you get to play are the woke, overenthousiastic hipster type. The way they behave themselves and talk.... In a vampire apocalypse? In a vampire apocalypse people would be scared shitless.... The people like the playable characters would be among the first to die in an actual apocalypse...
-The quests make no sense. Things like, fix the popcorn machine and put flowers on my brothers grave.... Come on... Its an apocalypse!!! It breaks immersion completely.
- The open world is empty and feels lifeless.
- The gunplay is mediocre at best.
- The AI of the enemies is dumb as hell.
- The game is way too easy and needs alot of balancing. The stake launcher for example is way to OP.
- The game is terribly overpriced. They dare to charge 70€ for for a game thats barely worth 15€...
- Big list of ingame bugs that should be fixed

Conclusion: This game is the perfect example of what is wrong with the gaming industry. Especially when it comes to AAA games.

Redfall,1294810,137970894,"I wanted to like this game, since it checks off the usual interests - open world, supernatural, exploration, Autumn setting, characters with abilities.

Gave it a good 20 hours at time of review, to see if the lackluster introduction gave way to improvements. Even with few bugs, it's still been ""meh"" most of the time. Story hasn't been told in a way that got my attention (normally something I am very forgiving about), the environmental storytelling has been sparse for an open-world game, the human enemies all feel very samey. Boss fights have been lackluster.

The one part that has caught my attention at all is the Grave Locks you can find, but while it's the most interesting story element it's delivered piece meal through 2-3 sentence voiced lines from items you have to scour otherwise lackluster areas to find them all -and there's a lot of them. 100 to be exact, with no way to track the locations you've already searched, and no indicator of how many are in the first area and how many are in the second area (important thing to know for collecting, since you can't travel back to the first map without starting anew in NG+. 

Feels like the most ""we need to pad out the time played on this game as much as possible"" feature I've seen in a long time.

I think the devs were just out of their depth on this one.",False,4,1514
Redfall,1294810,137969293,"Writing this review at about the 8 hours of play mark. All in all a good game. It isn't breaking the mold on anything but has a nice open feel without being too bloated. Multiplayer is straightforward. The performance is good with only a few issues like minor pathing issues for mobs, occasionally graphic hiccups, but nothing that has interfered with play-ability. Things I enjoy: The amount of world components that you can use to make combat more interesting. The simplicity of the mechanics and quest tracking. The pared down equipment and skill charts.",True,1,1247
Redfall,1294810,137969101,"I'm going to say that I recommend this game to players for the dream that it represents, not because of what is here... and I will elaborate on that first.

The Dream: Have you ever wanted to be a badass Vampire Hunter in a post-apocalyptic setting, gunning down hordes of Ghouls, Freaks, Vampires and the like? If that box is checked then this game is for you.

However:

And this is a strong one... due to the way the game is set up, I cannot recommend this for anyone who doesn't have an extreme hard-on for the idea of being a Vampire hunter... because of numerous bugs, one of the characters being basically useless (We'll get to this) and the game-progression/ general gameplay system being overly flawed (I will loosely explain this... but since its so new, y'know...)

Numerous Bugs: So sometimes vampires will just not attack and not be attackable... sometimes certain numbers glitch out, the party system will sometimes not work and if you don't play in Borderless Windowed Mode then the screen will essentially fuck up and you'll pretty much be screwed.

Broken Character: So Layla, the Psychic doesn't really feel all that Psychic... her first ability only affects humanoids... because they're the only one's shooting bullets... her basic passive increase point literally makes food items more potent (you can't pick up food for later)... rather than do something exceptional, like get more lock-picks or get more money or have a bigger health stack... her second ability is literally a aerial traversal skill that is beat entirely by another team member's (Devander's Teleporter), leaving her ulti... which isn't even a psychic power, the only really useful skill in her tool-kit. In a game where people have invisibility, teleportation, explosives and robots, would it of killed the dev's to give the psychic girl actual psychic abilities rather than dollar-store green lantern powers and a Vampire Boyfriend? I'm just saying... some things in her kit need a SERIOUS rework because the others can ez solo while she's lagging due to lack of utility.

Game Play/Progression: This is a serious one... Dev's, you better read this one CAREFULLY. It is 2023... we do not make a multiplayer game where a restart is required to play a specific section of a gameworld... fix it. Now. You are killing your fanbase before it begins... also, when you do fix it... and you know what I mean, since you put a literal ENDING in a multiplayer game... add some end-game content loop. Need inspiration? Look at skyrim, go play as an imperial and do nothing but collect rare gems, wealth and priceless artifacts and stick them in a chest... you will be BEYOND inspired to do some badass Vampire Hunter shit. Just saying.

Final Thoughts: What's here is fun... its great! But seriously... the things I listed, the negatives... they need to be addressed... and soon. I'm going to give this game the benefit of the doubt... I did pay 100$ for this game after all... but if things go sour, all I've got to say is that more love and care needed to go into making this game a more seamless and enjoyable game... because I also gifted it to someone for, yes, the same amount... I payed 200$ for this game with the hope and intention of it being good... so while I'll be patient and wait... I will seriously be considering how I spend my money in the future... as for the gameplay... don't finish the main quest till you get bored of the first area... and so on... You'll get a lot more hours out of the game. In fact, I haven't left the first area... and I've played every character in it, but friends of mine have and I'm none too happy about what they've told me the, ""End-game experience,"" is...",True,3,1773

Redfall,1294810,137965805,"I only played a little while. From what I got is that this is Generation 0, but with vampires. It has a few games, from what I have seen. I do like the open world. The only problem is that you can not really explore the entire town/city, most buildings are closed off. It would have been better if all buildings could be entered. The powers seem lame to me, could have been better.. The guns are okay, but still needs more guns. They should have stuck with character development, instead of having the characters already designed. I did not pick up on a story/campaign, so it is either there and just hard to find it, barely there, or just not there at all. Could have been a great story if they put it in.
",False,0,774
Redfall,1294810,137965632,"If you come into the game wanting non-stop combat as a key element, it won't really be what you're looking for. Approach the game the way it's presented—a town to explore that was torn apart from the inside so you need to fight to save its remaining community, with oodles of environmental storytelling bolstered by PC and enemy dialogue—and you should have a better time.

Redfall is a town beset by vampires and their cultists, but the situation had built up over time—weeks of neighbors acting strange, people going missing. That's why it's desolate, houses boarded up, shops shuttered.

This isn't a town dense with corpses turned undead. It's a town devastated by people turning on their community, sacrificing neighbors to a couple people in power. Yes, there's space between fights—because untold numbers of townies are gone, or left dead in the streets. If you take the time to look while you run around, there's a TON of crafted environmental elements underlining all that. So many notes, items, and corpses indicating clear, unique moments throughout the town.

I personally find the space between enemy groups a boon, because even while playing solo, you can't pause. So it's nice to be able to find an empty area to hide when a brief break is needed, without having to go back to a safehouse. And yeah, the game's got bugs—but what big game doesn't on launch? There's too many moving parts at this scale, within the game and for folks' respective setups. I personally haven't had anything game-breaking, so while I look forward to patches, I'm having fun poking around Redfall and figuring out just what the hell these vampire gods did.

Aesthetically, characters are stylized rather than hyper-realistic, which I personally prefer. It helps to avoid the uncanny valley 3d is prone to, and prevents looking “dated” as quickly because the exaggerations are deliberate. There's also a good bit of dialogue from key NPCs that is custom to the PC you play—using the PC's name in greetings and goodbyes, plus extra little chats that happen when you approach them. Stuff like Eva asking Dev if this is the weirdest shit he's seen, Anna asking whether he's got new inventions he's working on, etc., which make the connection to the world feel just that much more solid. I've also had the unique vampires call out my character by name, which caught me off guard the first time—can't say I was expecting the vampires to actually be sharing info with each other. I would like if there were some way to get a little voiced banter with the other PCs while playing solo, because I LOVE all the characters. But it's also fun reading the color-coded notes on the whiteboards, and Devinder's solo commentary is absolutely AMAZING on its own, so I am well entertained.",True,3,12217
Redfall,1294810,137965551,"Very first impressions. If you enjoyed Dishonored you will enjoy RedFall albeit in a different manner. The game is playable, 7900XTX 4k 60/70 fps on Epic quality without FSR. The game, IMO, need low level tweaking since I can observe notorious 'VRAM leaking', you start your play with 11GB of VRAM used and with FPS in the high 80's/low 90's and end the session with quite near 15GB VRAM used and FPS in the mid 70's, quite a loss.
Perhaps a lot of money for (again) a half baked game, but playable (and quite enjoyable so far), nonetheless.
I will update my review at around 20h

Update, stay away, or play it if you have X pass, the rest wait till it matures and be on sale. Fair price if full baked, stable and mature  50$/€, the actual price (70€) is a scam. 
I have tested the game in anothe rig, at 1440p using and RX6800XT with Epic quality, and the results are worst, for example in a closed environment (the Fire Station) the FPS jumps from 50 to 70 between the basement (the worst) and the lobby (the best) in no case the card can reach its max TDP, nor its percentage of use (ranging from 60% to 75%). The culprit? I don not know, could be the game that is clearly not optimized, could be AMD drivers, optimized for 7000 cards, could be DX12 or all of them. All in all a faulty and painful experience. For a comparison, with the same rig Cyberpunk 2077 1440p Ultra no RT no FSR, 80 FPS sustained, droping to 65/70 FPS on one of the more graphics demanding areas of the game, Lele Park - Chater Hill.

Redfall,1294810,137915876,"The good:

The game is a ton of fun, provided you manage your expectations. This isn't GOTY material by any means, but I am thoroughly enjoying my time with the game playing solo.

It performs decent on my system, traversal stutter notwithstanding. Your mileage *will* vary.

The story is intriguing, but nothing amazing yet.

The gunplay feels great once you get the controls tweaked. I play with a controller and the default response curve is dreadful. Definitely set it to low and bump your sensitivity to 3.25+ if you're playing with a gamepad.


The middling:

The visuals can look really good in some aspects, and really poor in others. I like the stylized art style they went with here. There can be a ton of little details in some areas, but then some woefully empty locations by contrast.

Not a lot to the game yet. Seems like it maybe needed another six months to flesh out the content.

Cutscenes are pretty low budget. Basically still dioramas with spoken dialogue. Good enough for the kind of game they made I suppose, but for the asking price these leave a lot to be desired.

The multiplayer centric focus ultimately works against the game as a whole. I would have enjoyed this far better had it been a more typical immersive sim from Arkane. I can't confirm as I haven't played co-op by myself, but it sounds like only the host actually progresses when playing co-op which is not great in my opinion.


The bad:

The AI, for real. 

A lot of the time, enemies can't even hit you at close range and their reaction time is hilariously slow between the time they've spotted you to when they start to engage. Then sometimes you'll get absolutely wombo combo'd by a group that seems to have the difficulty knob cranked to 11. The balance needs to be tweaked considerably to have it be more even across the board. At least the checkpoints are gracious and the enemies don't regain their health upon you respawning.

Limited stealth options despite the game encouraging it via tutorials. No stealth kill animations either. Just sneak up behind someone and elbow them in the b-hole. 

Getting stuck on invisible geometry. Or getting pulled into a wall by an enemy with no way to unstick yourself except to fast travel or quit the game.

Certain controls becoming unresponsive if you don't manually clear a tutorial popup. Basically crouch and the start buttons refuse to function if this happens. Again, only way to fix is to quit the game, or hope that another tutorial message pops so you can clear it.

The summary:

Overall, in it's current state I'd give it a solid 6/10 despite the amount of fun I'm having with it. If they can patch it into shape and get some more content in here, it could eventually become something worthy of a higher score. Wait for a sale.",True,3,1175

Redfall,1294810,137914367,"[h1] To those who are truly reading through the reviews: [/h1]

From my observations, this game received a harsh review bomb, and everyone else jumped on the band wagon. Now, let's get into the review. 

[olist]
[*] [b][u] VISUALS [/u][/b]
I have been playing for almost 13 hours and have had minimal frame lag or issues with the frames; I run primarily quality settings and average around 100 frames according to my AMD software. Most who experience issues might either leave settings on default (which includes super resolutions) or need to dial the settings in correctly. I would give this game's art style and visual effects an 8.5/10. There is work to smooth it out however, it is very pleasing already. 

[*] [b][u] STORY [/u][/b]
This story-line has you running all over the place and often puts you in a bind between two fighting factions, vampires, special vampires, and then a Rook all at once. On nightmare difficulty, I have to try not to die; later in the game, it gets more challenging; I consider the initial map a super long tutorial. The plot line of the story is simplistic. However, it is interesting as it is not your run-of-the-mill and keeps you busy. There are a few areas where it takes a dark turn, and I applaud the story developers for being willing to take the game to those darker areas. For story I give it a 7.5/10. 

[*] [b][u] GAMEPLAY [/u][/b]
Yes, the beginning is rather long and could be treated as a tutorial; the game feels similar to Dishonored, and the hit registry works beautifully; for solo play, this game is worth the time a player will put into it. For multiplayer, once they fix the issue of character progression (not story), the co-op will be worth it. A buddy and I played a few times, and even though we sometimes couldn't save character gear and leveling, we still joined and played together. The best part is I am stationed in Japan while he is in the US...if we can play together, you can too. Overall, it is a whimsical vampire slaying game with some decent ideas and mechanics. I score it at 6/10, with the only thing holding it back is the co-op progression issues. I will update the review in two months. 
[/olist]

[h1] [b][u] CONCLUSION [/u][/b] [/h1]

I have had more issues with the latest CODs, including Warzone & BLOPS4; I have had more issues with Dying Light 2, Elden Ring, and others. All of which could be mitigated by tweaking settings. The initial wave of people who tried this game did not keep an open mind and went into it thinking it would not work. Hence, no effort was put into making it work. While I agree a game should come ready to play when released, I don't think that is a fair assumption to have in the gaming community anymore, as we all do not account for the extra work that goes into making the games for multiple different platforms and trying to use the same mold. 

I have a great analogy for it: picture a road; in this instance, the road is the game. Now put one person in a semi-truck with all 18 gears and manual transmission, one in a forklift, and one on a generic 4-door sedan. All vehicles would need to use the road and would drive the same, especially, but to get them to drive is another story: different controls, different speeds, and different training. The vehicles are your hardware pieces. Eventually, things will smooth out as we learn; however, the launch is expected to be rocky.",True,103,981

Redfall,1294810,137911495,"TLDR: If you’re looking for reasons you need to play this game … there isn’t much to tell you. The most impressive thing about Redfall is how uninspired every part of it feels to play.


The graphics make it look like a late 2000s game, which I could live with if not for the fact that it is obscenely demanding even on top tier current gen hardware. Normally this is where one might place the blame on it being a port. That is a flimsy excuse here, as Arkane is owned by Bethesda which in turn is owned by Microsoft, and Redfall is an Xbox exclusive. Gameplay videos from Xbox do not look much better either. They only needed this to run well on their own operating systems, and they failed even at that!

Paul Tassi in his Redfall [url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/05/04/redfall-review-xbox-series-x-something-terrible-happened-here/?sh=7b3dc72c418a] review [/url] wrote: “In a sea of famous video game disasters over the last few years… I am genuinely unsure I’ve seen a game this bad.” He hits many of the other main notes, chiefly that the AI is atrocious, the core gameplay is dissatisfying (assuming it even works), the social implementation is a disaster (host progression only, and no matchmaking), etc. There is no shortage of scornful reviews, and frankly Redfall deserves nearly all of it.

Personally, I would like to know when corporate management/ownership will stop treating developers and players alike with undisguised contempt. It is insane to me that Microsoft/Bethesda/whomever had Arkane, of all people, make this game. It reminds me of when EA had Bioware make Anthem. Taking a studio that does a certain aspect of video gaming exquisitely well (level design, consequentialism, and stealth; narrative, and character design, respectively) and throwing them at whatever Big Thing has seduced the corporate executives.

Phil Spencer, Chief Xbox Guy himself, apologized for Redfall’s appalling launch. He tried claiming “They didn’t hit their own internal goals when it launched.” I don’t buy it for a second. Even if they didn’t know the specifics, how could they not know they had a mess on their hands? They pushed it out anyway to cash in on us. The blame and shame rightly belong with Microsoft more than anything else.

Bottom line: publishers need to stop bullying the little companies they’ve swallowed into making profit-chasing garbage far outside their strengths at the expense of everything else. Since they aren’t about to do that out of the goodness of their hearts, we need to demand it. Vote with your wallets. Do not buy this game.",False,158,102

Redfall,1294810,137908286,"I would be even more negative about this game if it had not come free with graphics card and I paid money.  Boy it's got issues.  Many I could overlook.  Like all good reviewers I'll share what I was looking for so you can decide for yourself if you'd feel the same.  

I have a zombie slaying posse that plays Back 4 Blood regularly and for the most part really enjoy the ""jump in and kill a bunch of things together"" vibe of that.  Our collective hope was that we could go from ""zombies to vampires"" and keep it up.  Sadly that is not the case.  

I'll mention first that if you watch the IGN review (gent with Aussie accent I believe) he sums up pretty much everything I didn't like about game.   But to summarize in my own words here's the negatives first: 
- Boring gameplay marred with horrible enemy AI 
- Multiplayer as of now only lets HOST progress.  This is where it diverges from B4B the most.  The nice thing about the B4B ""act"" structure was if you played through a level mid-act with friends hosting, it would be ""cleared"" for everyone (so even if you go back to solo play, etc, that level is now cleared at that difficulty).  In Redfall, potentially because of how they structured missions, etc. maybe that was just too difficult or they didn't think it through.  Not sure what to blame, I just know the game play is way too boring to keep going back to sections you've played through already with friends. 
- Repetitive Use of Game Assets: I get that after dozens of hours in any game you'll see repeating textures, models, etc. but just in the intro tutorial level on the starting location (boat) you find the same ""dead girl in beige sweater"", in exact same pose numerous times.  And worse, you MEET her alive later when you clear the first ""home base"" as part of that same introductory level.  
- You have to repeat the intro level for every character you want to swap out.  I have mixed feelings about making people replay from level 0 just to switch characters.  If it was more fun to replay maybe I wouldn't care so much
- Mobility - stiff.  I'll give you an example:  Jumping over objects, like a guard rail in the road.  Most games give you more flexibility to do that at canted angles vs having to face the object you are vaulting straight on.  So this means if you are running parallel down a road with enemies ahead and you want to vault something to your left but still see the enemies, you have to turn 90 degrees and face the guard rail.  I feel like this is just poorly implemented.  Noticeably annoying. 
- Sliding: you slide for days. Not horrible, just a bit longer than some other games I've played

So in summary, there's a lot to fix.  Lots of bugs (I'm hearing from review, I got too bored to find them myself) and bad AI.  Sadness.",False,7,384
Redfall,1294810,137907797,Product refunded,False,6,71
Redfall,1294810,137907755,"I received the $100 deluxe edition (whatever it's called) with my RTX 4080.

I was looking forward to the Redfall, given Arcane's history with Dishonored 1/2. Redfall is a bit disappointing, particularly when you consider its price-point.

TL;DR summary: Wait for a sale before buying. Maybe patches could improve some things. Seems like the developers were aiming for Borderlands with vampire, but they really missed the mark in terms of fun.

The AI is atrocious, I mean really bad. Most vampires don't do much other than swing at you and try to teleport behind you. Humans are dumb as well as you can take out most with headshots without others alerting.

The graphics are fine, it's not meant to be realistic, but there are more glitches than I would expect in a AAA title.

Audio is fine as well, nothing special here.

The environment looks good, again it's not meant to be realistic. Some of the locations are pretty neat.

The weapons are alright, nothing special here. There are a variety of weapons: at least 3 different kinds of pistols, a couple of types of flare guns, stake launchers, assault rifles of various types, shotguns, etc. Damage is based on the level of the weapon, weapon type and any inherent modifiers.

I haven't spent a lot of time with the skill tree as I am only level 6 or so. But I find that I don't need to use my abilities for much of anything, which is disappointing. Upgrading ammo capacity is definitely useful, but that's a passive ability.

I haven't experienced any performance issues so I can't comment there. My system is a Ryzen 7950X w/ 32GB of RAM, RTX 4080, etc. I put Redfall on my M.2 drive to get faster load times. For graphics settings, I set the resolution to 1440p 144Hz, enabled vsync, set DLSS to quality and left frame generation enabled (just to try it out). I get between 144 and 240fps and it's generally smooth.

I cannot believe this comes from the same studio that produced Dishonored and Prey, a $70 price tag for this heap is offensive. So incredibly disappointed in Bethesda and Arkane. The game looks and feels completely unfinished, what is the point of a so-called open world game when one is able to interact with almost nothing?

Redfall,1294810,137905572,"Just finished the game on 2nd hardest difficulty (since the hardest is unlocked after at least 1 playthrough kindve like a ng+) so here's my take:

Positives: 

The world is make well. Whatever devs were in charge of the world building and maps did a great job in my opinion, there isn't much repetitive content laying around other than vehicles and the map feels like a real place at times. Could it have been better sure, especially for a 70$ game, however it is one of the games very few better points.

The voice acting, i feel like every character in the game with voice lines (which i think is everyone) did a great job. Was the dialog generic and repetitive? yep! did the VA's do a good job reading the lines? also yep! The studio really didn't put too much work into recording a lot of lines, but the ones that are in the game were voiced well.. thats about it. 

thats about it...

The Negatives: 

The gun variety.. It's crap, it's dogshit, it's downright bad. For a game who's previews spouted all sorts of nonsense about gun variety and this and that, After your first hour of playing congrats! you have officially probably seen every single gun this game has to offer. Random rolls on guns? sure here's maybe 6 different lines every single gun can roll and that's it. I wasn't expecting borderlands levels of variety for gear but this game literally has pistols, ar's, shotguns, snipers, flareguns, uv guns, and spike launchers. Each with 2 or maybe 3 varieties, and very VERY minimally different stats, ie: double barrel shotty vers standard combat shotty. Slow firing harder hitting AR and a faster lightly hitting AR. The random rolls they get from green to purple rarity has something like 6 different stats they can roll and most of these stats you really have no idea what they change on the weapon. Added accuracy? ok what while aiming? while moving? bullet spread? bullet drop? NO IDEA! Anyways.. this was one of the major killers of this game for me, is after about 1-2 hours of playing you have experienced everything you are  going to see out of this looter shooter's gunplay. Even the legendary guns are just slightly beefed up regular guns with designated skins you can't change..No they do not add additional effects like ""this gun poisons on hit"" the most unique legendary line is something along the lines of ""this gun can kill vampires without staking them"". Overall when you get a legendary gun, it doesn't feel very good or rewarding, especially when you very VERY rarely come across legendaries.

The Legendaries: Feel sooooooo badddddd mannnn.... As i explained above, they are just so bland and boring how could you possibly feel like you are using a unique or legendary weapon when it feels exactly like any other weapon of its type?
there is a single legendary line ""this gun can kill vampires without staking them"" that actually feels unique since the only other way to kill a vamp is with a flar, uv light and smash, or stake. Every other legendary is just a slightly stronger version of a regular gun. 

Gun Rarities: ill keep this short. Gun and blood rarities were such a waste of time to even implement into this game. Whats rarity boil down to in this game? From white -> legendary, it just means its slightly stronger. Sure higher rarities roll more lines of effects, it's too bad there is only maybe 6 lines that guns can roll! Therefore pretty much every single gun feels the same! Added line of accuracy? yeah no you arn't going to notice that. Added line of dmg? wow gun hits slightly harder.. how fun and what a unique game design! +2 to mag size? Ok... you get my point. Rarities dont mean shit when there is only a small handful of effects things can roll. If youre anything like me you'll blaze through the game at normal, spend 10 seconds looking at if the numbers of a new gun are slightly higher, if they are you equip it and keep moving. Nothing will feel much different, nothing will feel new and refreshing. For a looter shooter this feels like shit.

The vamps and goonies: Here is the list of enemies you'll run into in game: Shotgunner, Sniper, Assault Gunner, Regular Vamps, Vamps with shields rotating around them, Anglers vamps that grab you and bite hard, Shade vamps that slightly blind you and shoot homing projectiles at you, the ""rook"" basically a tank vamp, the bloodbag kamikaze vamp, and lastly the siphon that has a bullshit blood suck ranged ability you have to stagger to stop. TEN....TEN ENEMIES IN THE ENTIRE GAME MINUS BOSSES.... just that one sentence would've prevented me from purchasing this game if had known before. The vamps themselves will look exactly the same throughout your entire playthrough, the human enemies will have slightly different outfits depending on which vamp god they worship but they literally all act the exact same. THER IS ZERO VARIETY IN ENEMIES. ugh.. this one kills me the most. 

The ""Bosses"": Let me start with, there are 2 maps in this game and each map has safehouses that give a measly 2 missions each. The first a generic, go here and kill or loot this quest. The second, always a hunt for a vampire ""boss"".. no... just no.. its a regular vampire out of the list of 4 vamps (there is no rook or blood bag varient of boss). The ""boss"" will have a name and 3 health bars... that's it.. no special abilities, no special loot, no special location to fight them in, nothing... I killed half of the safehouse mission bosses not even knowing it was a boss as i was making my way to where i thought they would be hiding... Absolutely zero effort given into making these fights feel special or anything. Let's continue... There are 4 main story bosses in the base game as well, which you will have to fight eventually as you progress through the story. These bosses felt unique and slightly challenging and fun to fight all except the final boss.... 

The Final Boss:..... WHAT THE FUCK... This is it, you have slogged through this completely uncreative, unmotivated, lazy ass half assed rushed assed game, and you've made it to presumably the best fight in the game right? NOPPPPPE. I can explain this fight in a single sentence. You walk in, see the boss and notice its attached to 3 different crystals of which you then break and the boss dies. BAM, ya did it champ. The few vampires that are left alive after the fight is over put up more of a fight than the final all powerful boss does. You heard that correctly.. you literally do not fire a single bullet into the final boss. It is tethered to 3 different crystalized vamps which you need to stake while being chased by a bunch of other vampires. Sure this might be difficult if the vamp ai was somewhat capable of chasing you over anything larger than a 6 inch step up in height, but is turns out you can just ezpz run to each crystal, stake it, and boom the fight is done. You proceed to walk over to the boss and plunge a stake into its heart and that's it. The vampire capable of blocking the sun with some sort of magic, powerful enough to lift millions of tons of ocean water off the ground and hold it there for weeks without trying... doesn't put up a single finger to stop you from trying to kill it.. Even after pushing through the game and getting use to the blandness that is redfall, this fight still had me in a stuper.. how the hell could the company who finalized this think anybody would have been satisfied with this? 

The ""cutscenes"": They are slideshows.. Yeah all those fancy animated trailers and previews you watched of the game with the characters acting all cool and all? Yeh nope... that doesn't exist.. they spent more money on the advertising animating budget than the actual game animated scenes... fun 70$ right!?

Ugh.. You can pretty much tell i can't do anything other than rant. This review and pretty much any other review of Redfall is going to be a long winded rant, because there is hardly anything good to say about this game..

Redfall,1294810,137902098,"First let me qualify. This is impression from a few hours and second im a rookie to arkane games.

Now is this game as bad as the reviews and youtubers make it out to be?
Yes and no.

While yes this game has some nasty flaws like a enemy ai that belongs in an asset ripoff quality game and way to much graphics issues like a little map your charather pops up when fast traveling that becomes a blurry mess even if it has loaded in several times in one session.

No its not the most horrible game for sure. The core off the game works fine and i do like the setting off redfall.

Bugs wise i havent seen much beyond my charather T posing in the inventory screen for a few seconds and some trouble booting the game up the first time.

-------------------------------------

Now gameplay wise though... Simply said the game works fine but thanks to a lackluster AI and certain game mechanics the challenge is just non existant. The grunt enemies simply get a line of sight on you and start shooting. No attempts to grab cover or keep moving making them easy targets if you have some sense of aiming. The vampires while requiring a bit more focus arent much more difficult. They can warp around which does give a bit of a scare factor as you try to keep an eye on them but the ones i have seen are mellee only. They never get close enough before i can stake them to death. I have taken on one mini boss but his ai was really confused by the principles of stairs and seemingly couldnt get off them.

Ammo is something to note as well. When you start you have to rely on drops and what you find. This does add some tension to vampire encounters as you need to land your shots to avoid having to enter a mellee fight. BUT after you secure HQ the game starts a mission that ends with a ammo box inside safehouses where you can buy a full ammo resuply which strips that challenge out.

From a technical perspective this game runs fine and should play okay on potatoes. The problem here is simply that the gameplay is trash. This game is not AAA. While it meets some basic technical criteria you’d expect from a AAA title like native HDR & ultrawide support, every other aspect of the game is underwhelming. Aside from the nice looking HDR, the graphics look more like a launch PS4/Xbox One title than a 2023 PC game. The AI is terrible. The open world is empty and not fun to explore. The quests themselves are boring and generic as it gets: go here, find a key, open a door, fight some zomb- I mean “vampires”. It doesn’t even have animated cutscenes, instead telling the story via still images thag look like storyboards created before animating the final cutscene. 

Redfall is like a really bad clone of Back 4 Blood. It’s got that same ‘designed for co-op’ feel as Borderlands, Gotham Knights, Dead Island 2, etc. with absolutely none of the fun or polish of those games. Seriously, this game makes Gotham Knights feel like a game of the year contender. Everything about Redfall screams ‘low budget’, which doesn’t make any sense. It’s a high budget $70 game that feels more like a mediocre indie game made by a small team. I felt like I was playing an alpha build of a game that isn’t supposed to have its final release for another 18-24 months from now. You shouldn’t feel like you’re playing a brand new Steam Early Access game when the product costs $70. I’m just thankful I received it from an Nvidia bundle because if I paid for this game specifically I would have refunded it.

Perhaps I will revisit this title in a couple years after it’s had tons of patches and any DLC all finished and attempt a co-op playthrough with my wife. Maybe Arkane will be able to improve it from being a ‘bad game’ to being at least ‘average’, but I’m skeptical. I doubt they will ever be able to bring this up to the quality level of other ‘designed for 4 player co-op’ games. What a tarnish on Microsoft’s brand; they should fire the suit who signed off on releasing this game in this state.",False,5,76
Redfall,1294810,137897893,"Every studio has to try something different at some point. Playing this with friends feels like playing a number of other looter-shooters. Four people stroll into a building an holy hell breaks loose because there's no plan and everyone reacts on their own. There's so damn many of you that you make it out ok. Nobody knows the plot, but you're there to hang with your mates and that's the real point.

To that end, the game works. Movement and shooting is good, healing one another is fine. Baddies require some cooperation if there is a lot of them. It's great that there is no loot competition; you can't trade gear and everyone has their own instance of a bag or item to pick up.    

The world is pretty, and the plot feels like... Dying Light meets Prey, but with The Strain painted over it?

Edit: There have been updates, and some of the dumbness of the AI has been fixed. I really like the world, but to keep the tension up it really needs to be played alone.
I'm enjoying it a lot in solo. Lots of things to put together just by reading the notes and looking at the scene. Stealth feels good, but honestly I'm so well equipped that it takes a mob to down me. That's the scaling difficulty, and I haven't decided if I like that yet or not. There is a LOT of Deathloop in this game. A lot. From predictable NPCs to gorgeous and evocative places to discover. AI like that is part of what allows you to hide and take them down. It would be nice if some of the more cunning enemies WERE more cunning, not just able to see you through walls or something...

But consider those four people walking into the building again. If it wasn't a 90 degree cone of vision and an unwillingness to see bodies on the ground, how would you sneak up on them? Alerting one sends up a shout that alerts the pod. One of your friends is going to be half paying attention, blast someone in the head, and ruin your attempt to be a ninja. And you can't Hitman the bodies around, sooo.

Redfall,1294810,137884144,"I was very skeptical about purchasing this game after reading all the negative reviews but I have been waiting to play this for several months so decided to risk it.  After playing through several hours and missions, I have to admit that I'm not sure where all the hate is coming from.  Here is my experience based on the current PC version:

1.) Difficulty- I mostly play RPG and survival games with the occasional FPS.  I found this game to be plenty challenging and have died numerous times to various situations.  Weeping Tammy was a major pain and killed me so many times I lost count. Maybe as I reach higher levels it becomes easier due to better gear but right now it is plenty difficult.

2.) Open world- A lot of people criticizes how empty the world feels.  I have two thoughts on this. First, the setting reminds me of the movie The Purge.  Whatever is plaguing Redfall has been going on for at least weeks if not months from what I can tell.  With cultist and vampires killing people indiscriminately during that time, I would expect the town to be largely vacant (what normal person would stick around and carry on their daily routine).  For me, this plays into the atmosphere of the story and I found it to add a creepy vibe. Second, that said, I still easily found enemies to fight when I wanted too.  I'm not sure how the developer could add a lot more without the town becoming over crowded.  I don't think it would make sense to flood the streets with enemies like, for example, Dying Light.  I personally enjoyed the opportunity to explore houses for notes and equipment without constantly being attacked.

3.) Performance- I average between 50 and 60 fps for most of the game with the occasional unexplained dipped into the teens.  I have not been disconnected at all since I started playing.  I haven't really noticed any major bugs either yet.  I would agree that the aiming for weapons feels a little off but you get use to it after playing. Enemy AI isn't the most sophisticated but it isn't the worst either.  I would say its about average. Can you exploit some of the enemies if you really wanted too? Sure, but that's a choice your can make or not and I have found it to be largely situational anyway. 

Maybe the biggest mistake was marketing this as an action shooter in a vampire setting when it probably should have been presented more as a horror exploration game with FPS elements.  I do agree that $70 dollars is steep but I feel that way about any video game (unfortunately I think this is going to be the new norm for price).

Game runs well for me the world and style are good. 
The gun play feels abysmal, stats on guns that have no measurements in game to show what changes and feel like they change nothing anyway.
Ai is broken unable to spamn correctly half the time either in walls or ""invincible"". Ai shoot threw walls negating as attempts at cover.

The concept seemed really fun and finally an escape from the zombie forms of games like this and i was really into seeing where they took the story. Unfortunately, the game fell a little flat when it came to what it seemed to advertise.First off right off the bat the game tosses you into fullscreen mode (which is generally the norm) but, forget it if you have a multi monitor display it completely broke everything and DIDNT let you fix the settings before going through a long drawn out frustrating process to either log in or make a new account. If you tried to alter the graphics settings in anyway your picture became all granulated and wonky causing you to have to hard reset the game just to fix it (MAYBE!). In the coop mode there was no text chat all comms, you couldn't join a game in session (even though it only progressed the host's game), the connection was stuttery, if someone d/c'd you needed to go back to lobby by quitting the game (which split up who remained in the party) and had to reinvite everyone once again (again this goes back to the not being able to join a session in progress) and then relaunch hoping that no one would d/c again. There was no loot sharing/trading, everyone was in there own instance (I guess you would call it) which took away from the feel of all being in a group of survivors traversing this vampyric nightmare,  This so far is JUST the coop aspect i haven't even gotten into the general gameplay. For the general gameplay I can only touch on what i saw because after an hour and a half i refunded but there were barely any enemies and the AI was worse than a storm trooper bullet storm shooting at a main character with plot armor. Forget about upping the difficulty it didn't seem to do anything. When you happened to find enemies (and trust me they were few and far between) it was (from what i saw) the same 4 enemies with different gun variants with a few vampires trickled in. It just generally felt clunky and not that great to play. Oh and by the way its a $70 price tag. I'm not sure why we think games releasing like this to, ""Be fixed down the line..."" is acceptable at all. I can understand maybe some bug or hiccups on launch but there should be a team ready and prepared on launch day to hammer out as many issues as possible. This quite frankly seems like a really fun game in theory but with all the issues and feeling like the game isn't even finished for the highest price i ever payed for a BASE GAME variant it is certainly not worth the money.

Redfall,1294810,137869141,"A couple of months ago, I wrote a positive Steam review for Arkane’s previous title, [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP/]Deathloop[/url][/i], ending on: “I think there will come a time when we'll look back at [i]Deathloop[/i] and wish there were still 'AAA' developers left that're willing to take such risks for the sake of pure creativity.” Who would have thought that Arkane themselves would usher in exactly such a time?

This latest Arkane (Austin) opus is a mess. No, it’s not the ""worst game evar"" that some people proclaim it to be, but [b]it’s uninspired, mechanically simplistic and filled to the brim with bugs, glitches and gameplay systems that just aren’t fun[/b]. Perhaps most relevant to the quote from the beginning of this review, [b]Redfall is also highly derivative of about a billion other looter shooters[/b], most of which did what Redfall tries to do, except better.

[b]Redfall is a game that aspires to mediocrity[/b], but it’s held back by countless bugs, from world meshes that will get you stuck if you dare to explore the map, to erratic or unresponsive AI, to omnipresent graphical and technical problems such as fps dips, glitches, constant pop-ins and flickering world shadows. [b]If they take the time to fix everything that’s just outright broken in the game, it might be worth 30 or 40 bucks[/b].

[b]But even for a fully fixed Redfall, the 70 bucks price point is simply a ludicrous proposition. The design decisions that make Redfall a mediocre game at heart won’t (and probably can’t) be fixed to such an extent as to justify this asking price[/b]. The open world exploration is too bland, the fighting feels too floaty, the skills aren't interesting enough, the graphics are disgustingly crude in many areas and the entire experience feels simplistic and uninspired.

What's more: Some of the decisions Arkane (Austin) made for Redfall are outright insulting to the customer. For example, cutscenes are exclusively stills of posed character models with voice acting in the background. No actual animations, no lip synching. Look, [b]I’m generally fine with doing something like this as a cost-saving measure for indie devs – but Redfall is a ‘AAA’ game with a 70 bucks asking price, for crying out loud[/b]!

The bottom line is: If Arkane manage to patch the game into a fully functional state, it may be worth buying at a SIGNIFICANT discount if you’re into Far-Cry-like games and you’ve played all the good ones already. But [b]in its current state and at its current price point, it’s a definite  “don’t buy this!” from me[/b]. If you haven’t played Arkane’s masterpiece [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/480490/Prey]Prey[/url][/i] yet, get that one instead! If you have played it, then get [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1252330/DEATHLOOP/]Deathloop[/url][/i], which isn’t Arkane’s best, but it’s leagues ahead of Redfall. If you're more into straight-up looter shooters, get one of the Dying Light games, or a Far Cry game or a Borderlands game and so on and so forth... There are so many fully functional and fun games to play, why waste your money and time being an unpaid beta tester for Redfall?

[h3]Quick update[/h3]
I tried to get a refund for Redfall, but I made the mistake of giving it a chance beyond the 2 hour limit (played for about 5 at the time), so Steam says I'll have to live with my awful purchasing decisions on their store.
Just to put this into perspective for you as a potential buyer: I've been an unapologetic Arkane fan ever since [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1700/Arx_Fatalis]Arx Fatalis[/url][/i] and I'm a 'mea culpa' kinda person in general – I don't normally ask for refunds. [b]I even played through[/b] [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I]The Last Of Us[/url][/i] [b]when that disastrous PC port was released, as [i]The Last Of Us[/i] is at least a decent game underneath all of the technical issues. So someone like me asking for a refund for Redfall should be a giant red flag for you![/b]

In the 5.6 hours I've played this game I have:
-Had to update DLSS with a separate program just to get the game to get better framerates
-Had to tweak a bunch of things like disabling full screen optimizations and setting the application to full power mode in the windows graphics settings
-Seen a vampire who spawned into the world but was not an actual ai entity that I could harm or trigger at all and he just kept leaping from rooftop to ground level 
-Been dropped from several games with friends in such a short period of time
-Experienced the entirety of what the game has to offer in under 8 hours ""the gameloop""

There's potential here if the devs pull up their pants and actually put some work into this game, but nobody involved in this release is deserving of any of your money.

-Bad controls.
-Bad AI like actually the worse Ive seen so far, kill 5 enemy's and then they realize you are there, and they have stormtrooper aim.
-Unfinshed game.
-Story is a joke.
-Open world ? funny.
-Lets charge 70 euros is the way to go.
-A lot of buggs, I have been going through the ground for 3 times and had to make a new save cuz it kept on happening.
-Lets make coop only instead of multiplayer with randoms.
-Game felt boring anything You do, even the ""unlock boxes"" is just boring why would you.
-Take cover btw, you win every fight, like litterly.
-Bad optimization.
-Cant find friends cuz noone plays it, for a good reason tho, I think.
-Difficulties are a joke
-Do I have them all ? probably not.

Redfall,1294810,137851128,"Update as of May 7th: Studio behind the game has been shut down. Since this is an always online game, the game will only last as long as the servers.

------Original Review from here--------

Boring story: One of the first few missions sees a character a die and I honestly was just like ""Okay. What's next, oh, another annoying vampire to fight."" The cutscenes that barely have anything to do with the words being said over them don't really make you interested in any characters.

Boring guns: The guns have cool designs, but none of them feel particularly good to use other than I'd say the Stake Launcher, which overkill one shots basic vampires on the highest difficulty you can start on.

Boring/Annoying vampires: Basic vampires have a tendency to teleport all the time, often through walls which causes them to immediately lose track of you. Other times they teleport far from you and run in a straight line towards you. Tip for fighting them(even though I highly recommend not to bother even buying this game): Just strafe around them in a circle. Most vampires' attacks will miss you. If you just back up in a straight line, you'll get hit almost every time. That is if the AI doesn't bug out and get stuck on terrain. 

Other enemies: Other enemies seem to be a masculine and feminine version of what feels like a generic Fallout enemy in masks and beanies. These enemies will usually miss their first 2 shots, then have dead on aim the rest of the time they are alive. This brings me to the only time I felt like the difficulty increase mattered. I started on Normal, then went up to Hard. The only difference felt like how hard things hit you. It didn't feel rewarding to beat enemies, it just felt terrible when I died.

World: Feels okay, but there are definitely some things where it's just sorta meh. Locations don't seem to have anything but a bit of loot(mostly ammo with the occasional weapon) until the mission that centers on that location fills it with enemies. Not to mention traversal doesn't feel great, which I can only assume is because they wanted all characters to be able to access everywhere with the same amount of difficulty.

Missions: My main problem with missions is that you can't take on multiple at a time, even if they don't have conflicts. Like, you can see ""Oh, this mission takes me here, which is right by this place that this other mission wants me to go do."" To bad, you have to do one then the other. The exception to this is side quests that aren't missions.I have seen two of these, and they also felt pretty bland with one just being an overused Dishonored reference(Whiskey and Cigars).

UI: The UI always feels like it's taking up way too much of my screen, especially when markers are on it. The game is full of markers, a lot of which trigger from things that would be nice to find on your own. Teleport way points and Safe houses both trigger a popup marker and a voice line from about 50m away, which is quite a distance. Doesn't even matter about line of sight, I had one pop up while i was two rows of houses away.

Voice Lines and Subtitles: I like subtitles to be on. It helps me concentrate on what is being said and actually absorb the information. Especially since I usually have music on or am talking to others. This game has the option for Closed Captions or Subtitles. It says one of these provides more texts, but neither seem to make any notable difference for me, because it was constantly telling me stuff like ""Vampire Feeding"" or ""Grunt of effort"" when my character fell from a slightly high place, or some random line my character was saying about a place I've never been but this character apparently used to frequent before vampire takeover. 

Abilities: I've only played the Telekinetic girl so far. Shield feels fairly useless, Launch pad is alright and can be fun to use to break falls or go in unintended paths(ground that should push you off even though it sorta looks like you can walk on it), and then her Ultimate feels absolutely useless. Never felt it make any kind of impact. Also, I sorta wish since it summons a character, I actually got to know that enemy before hand, but all he seems to do is teleport in, fist bump, and then nothing.

Bugs/Performance: Performance has been okay for me with the exception of the constant microstutters. No settings seem to impact this, just constant stutters as I move a around. As I already said, AI breaks on terrain fairly easily. I'd list the Vampire teleporting through walls and losing you here. My biggest problem and the reason I stopped playing is the following: Had a mission to keep Bloodbags(exploding enemies) away from a crystal or a strong vampire would emerge. This spawns way too many enemies for you to be able to stop it, so I got stuck fighting the vampire two times. I say two times even though I attempted this about 5 times, because 3 times the Bloodbags killed me because there's no indication just how large the explosion radius is, and it deals a ton of damage. The two times the vampire was summoned, I died shortly afterwards, and when I returned the vampire was broken. First it couldn't be interacted with, and the second it disappeared but I could still see it's shields. Couldn't reset mission without going back to main menu.

Final thing: Always online in singleplayer causing me to lose progress felt terrible, but from what I know, they say they're going to remove this. 

I highly recommend looking elsewhere for your vampire hunting needs, or even just fun in general, because as is, Redfall is not fun. It's mostly just boring.",False,17,383

Redfall,1294810,137847458,"I wanted to wait and finish the game before I made a complete judgment, and it's safe to say this game doesn't redeem itself if you power through any of the obvious issues (like performance) However, I'm going to ignore those to point out the more glaring sins it commits in the realm of open world/looter shooter/rpgs:

 - a quarter of your skill tree is inventory upgrades
 - previous areas (though there are only 2 total) can't be accessed after you leave them
 - there is no ""point of no return"" warning before the final boss
 - the final boss, unlike the previous bosses, isn't a boss fight. 
 - there isn't a post game, you are forced into ng+, which sees no experience boost/buff and no difficulty change
 - coop progress is kept by only the host
 - loot rarity is worthless and only seems to be influenced by the percentage buffs to specific interactions or stats
 - without a ""silent"" method to kill, stealth mechanics feel wasted
 - no cutscenes, just 3d rendered characters and scenes that struggle to render fully while they're playing
 - dialogue is stiff, sometimes cringe and overly serious, and npcs are static while they deliver it
 - half of the traversal abilities are rendered useless in areas due to invisible walls and barriers
 - weapon purchases are expensive while trade prices are abysmal

The list could go on as I nitpick further, but a lot of these things were improved, fixed or avoided by games released well before Redfall came out and they were successes that earned appeal for sequels. How can a company miss so hard on every tenet of a good open world game when it unabashedly takes notes from something like Far Cry that has such mass exposure to players? AND even if not one of the developers worked on Arkane's previous titles, how can you not draw inspiration from at least ONE thing from the better parts of those games? 

I managed to maintain the minimum level of enjoyment and pace to get to the finish line, and now that I'm there the only thing I can give them credit for are interesting concepts in the lore/writing.

Redfall,1294810,137839672,"So the game for me has run pretty well overall and I do not think it deserves the mostly negative rating. However, it probably had more potential than what was actually delivered. 

AI is pretty lackluster, specifically detection range and pathing. Frequent travel out of the game world to linear pyschic zones and half-empty nests was also pretty meh. An actual area infested or even an RNG basement would have been a bit cooler in my opinion. Also would have been nice to travel between the two play areas freely. I feel like you see about the same 2-3 guns for each weapon category, which is probably the biggest annoyance. The unrivaled weapons still go off those few base weapons, just with an extra perk at the cost of unchangeable skins and stakes. Unrivaled weapons seem to have a lot of the same perks for that named gun. They are pretty satisfying to use though, especially the stake launcher and flare pistol against vampires. Also the perk that allows your bullets to finish vamps changes the tracer color which is pretty cool.

The abilities are fun though, at least Devinder's abilities. His shock javelin has a fairly low cooldown so you can use it multiple times in engagements, the blacklight staff was also super dope. Very satisfying to AOE 4-5 vamps at once. Teleport was meh, more coop focused but still nice. The worldbuilding and setting are also extremely well done. I love the environmental storytelling, seeing a blood trail go down into the basement, or some groups final stand with backs (bodies) against a wall. But there is a tonnn of notes scattered about to accompany that, a bit too much imo.

I just don't see a world in which this could be patched into something worth playing - go back in time five years or so and warn the project leads to do a classico Arkane immersive sim instead maybe, new-gen Vampire the Masquerade-type of game. It's more fun with a friend but so's everything! Go play like, Tiny Tina's or Destiny or Killing Floor or even reinstall Left 4 Dead instead.

I don't love a loot forever game, but it's like Redfall can't even commit to being a co-op looter shooter - there's a way to make a good game in that genre and this just isn't it. Gear just isn't interesting or worth getting here, and if you join someone else's game for co-op you don't keep your progress, which makes sense for something like Elden Ring where it's a single-player game with a co-op element, but this is sold as a fully cooperative, Borderlands/Left 4 Dead type of deal! Worst of all worlds for all the genres Arkane's drawing from, and my only hope is that this doesn't affect the studio in the long term, Arkane Austin can just get a stinker out of their system and get back to the single player, meticulously crafted, immersive games they do best.",False,6,192

The performance of the game is also terrible.  Stutters for days and inconsistent framerates the whole time.  

Everything just feels so juvenile.  Not fully thought out and the ""mechanics"" were just thrown in.  But there are no quality mechanics.  ""See enemy, click till dead.""  Your ""powers"" are worthless.  Find a weapon that has the highest damage number and use it.

Redfall,1294810,137831921,"In it's current state, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. While many negative reviews are just jumping on the outrage train and are without substance, game really is that bad. It's unbelievable that we are served this. I usually don't buy AAA games on launch, but Arkane always delivered good games so I decided to trust them this time. 

While it was obvious that this game will be different than other Arkane titles and would not follow the immersive sim design philosophy so that we would not get another Prey or Dishonored, it still seemed that this game had good and innovative concept behind it and it would have a quality of its own. I mean, Arkane making a game in a small abandoned town full of vampires? Sign me in! It was literally the opportunity for Arkane to realize their take on Ravenholm level from HL2 into a full blown game. So I was ready to consider this game without comparing it to previous Arkane titles. But this game breaks on practically every front. 

Optimization is the least of its problems. Yes, it is terrible, but you can play it on a reasonable computer on  40-60 fps. Enemy AI is very basic, and that problem is more obvious when you are in open areas. Gameplay mechanics are also very bland and underutilized. There's very little reason to use any abilities in combat when just shooting enemies in the head will do a better job 99% of the time. Also, your ability to use the environment to your advantage in combat, is very limited, almost non-existent.

Enemy placement is also very bizarre and is probably my biggest gripe with the game. To illustrate. I would stroll an empty street during the sunny day and just find a vampire levitating in a park near the road. Just standing there until I get close enough. Why? Game often feels like some fanmade map or a mod for some other game with random placement of enemies. Vampires are such a cool idea, and the opening scene where they hide from the sunlight is so cool. But then you realize that sunlight plays no role. Apparently there is an eclipse, but that is a BS excuse. The best encounters with vampires are in closed areas and dark corners, and that is where this game shines. I expected there would be some system where vampires would only walk freely during the night, and during the day they would hide. Also, its very easy to kill those vampires, so they are not so scary and just become tedious to deal with.

Despite all of this, I can see that there was a great game in here somewhere. In the closed areas where the game is more focused there is that sweet Arkane environmental storytelling. Case in point: the opening level in the boat. You navigate through tight corridors, find a note about a hidden pistol in the car, look for medical supplies find shortcuts to utilize that sweet looping level design.

But then the game decides to throw all of that away for the most part. There are some segments here and there where the good game/level design resurfaces, but they are very rare. Also, the town of Redfall is actually very well made, and there's a lot of ways you can navigate around and explore. The problem is, you barely have any reason to do so. Once again, this looks like some (very well made) map for Garry's Mod.

My biggest regret is that I gave this game a chance for longer than 2 hours, so my refund request will probably be rejected. Maybe after months and months of patching this might start to resemble a decent game, but I wouldn't hold my breath.",False,396,608

Redfall,1294810,137829117,"Usually I wait till I beat a game before I review it but being that there are thousands of negative reviews coming in for this recently released game with people having only played a few hours of it, I’d thought I’d add my positive review now to help balance it all out! This review is based on single player alone and with around 8 hours of play only. 

PRESENTATION: 

Game looks fantastic! It’s colorful and dark at the same time. Love the mix of incredible illustrative animated art cutscenes when you select a new main mission and the stunning small town neighborhoods with the mysterious setting of floating static water and blood pools. The 3D characters look great. The illustrative animation intro to the game is stunning.   

Story is interesting enough at this point, with cultists following a “Hollow Man” and helping the vampires out for some reason. There is a mystery of how the vampires were created and as you move around the map, you get proximity dialogue from the vampires and cultists, which is interesting and scary at the same time. Along with occasional announcements you can hear from the Hollow Man, with a beastly voice that helps set the scary mood. Artifacts, notes and journals you find throughout the open world and doing side and main quests, moves the narrative forward. The character you choose also from time to time will spit out some dialogue, contributing to knowing them and personalizing the story. Killing vampire animations are brilliant. Sounds are everywhere and contribute to the deathly environment you are in. Day/Night and weather cycles are executed well and the game greatly increases its frightening mode when it’s dark. Overall, developers have created a very beautiful, spooky, immersive environment.    

GAMEPLAY:

I like how you can only have one main mission selected at once to focus on, giving you some choice in the branching main quest. Mission menus are done well and you can clearly see main quests from side and safe house quests. Weapons are fun to use and varied and upgrades to them work well. I like how easy it is to compare different weapons. Fast travel is possible on the smallish map and movement and fighting is very much like Aracane’s previous title Dishonoured. Though the jumping doesn’t feel as well executed in Redfall. I’ve only done a few special power upgrades at this point from the skill tree, but seems to be executed well and gives a greater sense of progress. Though this is where some issues with the game can be highlighted. 

I haven’t really felt the need to use my character’s special powers because of how bad the AI is in this game. I’m currently playing on the highest difficulty you can start with, which is Midnight. Can be challenging when you get attacked by multiple vampires at once. But the cultists are way too easy and seem clueless, doing things like running right past you instead of shooting. I’ve also come across a few vampires that are just floating in the sky and you can come right up to them and get the first shot right in their face. Are they sleeping …? I have died a couple times so, on this difficulty at least, you will still get some challenges. Still needs to be seen how the difficulty scales. Would have been nice to have the highest difficulty unlocked right from the beginning for more of a challenge for those who like that, which seems to be the locked “Eclipse” mode. Also to mention, there are many things to pick up throughout the game to get some XP, ammo, health etc. Too much of it and most seem a bit pointless collecting, or at least not exciting to pick up. Especially when you are so easily killing everything and just don’t need that much health and ammo around to pick up. It’s almost like there was supposed to be more challenges and things to kill but the game is missing them. Certain objects are also highlighted that you can shoot and they would explode to help you take out a group of villains but the game is not challenging enough to need to use them.  

PERFORMANCE:

I’m on an RTX 4090 and i9 13900k. At 4K and with DLSS on and set to quality mode of DLAA, I’m getting an average fps of 160. Every few minutes I get a very brief stuttering happening in game play. I’ve had the game freeze on me once and certain things like I can’t search bags that are meant to be searched, vampires frozen, and when the game restarts, my main gun has changed to some other gun. Other than that, the game has run well. 


VERDICT:

The presentation in this game is fantastic and overall the level design is executed well. There are some serious issues with the AI and the difficulty level is too easy and these need to be fixed. These, along with the high price for the game, are the biggest areas that are bringing the points down. Still, an enjoyable experience, at least in single player mode.

Give the FPS thing some time and see how it turns out. As for bugs, people were crying the day of launch. But I remember a certain Fallout 4, who's bugs included not being able to leave the vault at the start of the game on launch. This game has no such bugs, maybe a couple minor performance hiccups and rare AI behavior issues. And all of that will get better.
If people are crying about limited content... Fair. This is Arkane's weakest title to date. I feel there's a few reasons for that, But these issues are honestly not enough to make it a bad game imho.
At the end of the day, Arkane is known for one thing I think above all. Fluid, rewarding combat. And this game delivers that like a semi. It's not jam packed with unique features like most of their previous titles. But it's a fresh, new open world co op shooter. And a decent one, which we haven't had in a while it feels.

I like th mission layout of this game a great deal so far.

Now I don't think this game is worth 70 bucks but still allot of fun which no one seems to be talking about.

Cons I have.
• poor characters (npc) just awful lip sinc and character gesture and animations.
• taking back the neighborhood is a joke! One mission before fighting the vampire? wtf.

Redfall,1294810,137823726,"I really loved the Dishonored games and Prey, but Redfall is not ready for release. It seems like an alpha at best. I can't tell if this game will be fun and engaging once it is fully fleshed out and patched, but right now it is buggy and incomplete. Vampires that are non-responsive and can't be killed, NCP sliding across the ground instead of walking, terrible AI on enemies, characters that don't interact except to say ""Hi!"", and many other annoying issues. I bought the game because I liked Arkane Studios previous games, but now will be more careful about buying them on the release date in the future. The game should have either been released as a lower cost alpha, or should not have been released until finished.

The story is boring, almost absent, and there is no real interaction with the other characters. The so-called story is just narration over bad still images. Characters in the game just stand there and look at you and there is no sense of interaction. Most of the town is just an empty place with houses and stores that you can't enter. No throwable explosives or any other such things. Lots of glitches where the game just stops working and you can't complete the mission, forcing a restart. 

I am fairly certain that many people at Arkane were very upset with management that this game was going to be released at this price range when it was in this horrible a condition. I just hope these many negative reviews from Arkane fans will get the out-of -touch management at these game studios to stop doing this to their fans.

I believe they need to tweak the enemy AI for better combat interactions, because it can feel dull and very silly at times.

Deathloop I could make the case for an Arkane-lover buying it day 1 (it's me, hi, I'm the problem it's me); however I cannot recommend people purchase Redfall in this state. Deathloop at least had a killer story and environment. This has a decent bit of both, but 70$? And kicking me off if my internet blips in my single-player session? Arkane. I am one of your hardcore fans, but that's ridiculous. [Yes, I know a lot of blame rides on Bethesda for this]. 

I would say as purely a game it's a solid 6/10. But for the price I can't argue for purchasing it so in a binary system like this I have to give it a thumbs down. Here's hoping they give it the TLC that the new Battlefront II got.

Steam has asked if I'd like to revise this review in light of the additional 20 hours I've played since the update. Short answer is: They've fixed a lot of bugs but it'll never be a 70$ game. Heck, Cyberpunk 2077 I got for less than 50$ on a sale and I still feel ripped off because it shouldn't have launched that poorly. Let alone this game, which had a smaller scope and still managed to fumble the bag.

It has the barest of bones of a co-op shooter with none of the polish. Enemies are extremely weak and the AI is awful. Me and my friends worked through all kinds of bugs and issues to beat the first area. We killed the boss through each add phase in 2 hits it was so underwhelming.  We tried to play the second area today, in 1 hour i crashed 4 times, had chat break 3 times and got connection errors and got kicked 5 times. 

TLDR - The game is an absolute buggy mess and not worth a purchase at this time.

Redfall,1294810,137809592,"While I didn't technically pay for this game directly, as I received it as part of bundle for a graphics card, I must say it is still disappointing. 
I didn't even know I was getting this game, but after purchasing the card I received the download codes, and proceeded to at least look at the trailers and read the upcoming info to see what it was. I saw it was Arkane and Bethesda, the former of which I am only minutely aware of as I have played a little of Prey and Dishonored. Those games, as far as I know, hold esteem with many people, some of my friends included, and I found them to be quite enjoyable from what I played. The trailers looked somewhat promising, and I will admit I was at least intrigued about the setting and implementation.

I only say this to establish my standing leading up to the game and afterwards.

As it stands now, I have no intention of playing more. I didn't run into any game breaking bugs or performance issues myself so my problems with this are purely gameplay, mechanics, story, etc...
The hour or so I put into it felt... uninspired would probably be the best word, but let me boil the essence of the problem for you. I felt disconnected from something I should have been engrossed in, mainly the world/setting. Prey had its own downsides, but there was an engrossing setting with threats and intrigue. I could say similar for Dishonored, with its great structure providing utility and a lot of freedom. Maybe I didn't play long enough, which would be fair criticism of this review, but know that for some reason I wasn't sold on the future possibility of becoming invested in either the characters, the world, or the mechanics of the game in the time I played. 

There might be a nugget here for somebody but I don't know how long I have dig to find it myself.

Redfall,1294810,137807553,"After having such great luck with other reportedly buggy games I had high hopes I would purchase this and it would run great, play great and prove everyone wrong.  Alas that is not what happened.

Graphics are a 6 out of 10 at best.  In 2023 I expected much better than what I saw in the game.  Even on epic settings graphics seemed mediocre at best.  Not a great start.

AI is pretty much non-existent.  Every and I mean EVERY enemy I encountered would stand there while I ran right up to them and shot them in the face.  It was as if they were just waiting for me to kill them.  They rarely reacted and when they did it was as if they were in no hurry to respond or react to me.

While the game ran fine there were a fair amount of glitches here and there I encountered.  Enemies got stuck on geometry, animations were a bit quirky, and event triggers seemed a bit delayed.  

I really hope that Arkane goes in and fixes this up.  This whole ordeal feels much like Back 4 Blood when it launched.  I hope they don't treat it like Back 4 Blood and jump ship the way the devs for Back 4 Blood did.  Currently there is no way this is worth $70, not even half that.  Do better Arkane!

UPDATE:  After having played this a bit more and it receiving several patches I thought a revisit would be in order.  The game as a whole has been improved.  It runs smoother and more stable now than before for sure.  Most of the glitches I noticed before are gone, the is next to no stuttering and the graphics do look a bit more crisp.  My only gripe right now are the human AI enemies.  I have noticed little to no improvements to their behavior.  I think if they could just get them to react in a more competent manner to the player (i.e. take cover, dodge, etc) then the game would be solid.

I'm not going to go over every little detail as professional reviewers can and have done it better. The game is an under baked mess.

The world is well-designed and does not feel empty, with a wide variety of vampires and other mobs roaming around. While the game could be optimized, this is typical for many games upon release and should not detract from your overall enjoyment.

However, it's important to note that Redfall is not a game designed for solo play. It's best enjoyed with friends, as this will make the experience more engaging and enjoyable. Playing with others will also give you a chance to take the game at a more relaxed pace and fully explore the world without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.

Overall, if you're looking for a game that offers solid gameplay, a well-designed world, and fun co-op experiences, Redfall is definitely worth checking out.

I know there's a lot of comparison of it being between Left4Dead/Back4Blood and Borderlands in description, but the there's more of a State of Decay 2 aspect than L4D/B4B to a lot of the navigation due to the open world aspect.

Cons: It's buggy. The AI isn't great. Navigating the interface to get graphics to the proper resolution and display settings is resistant AF (I did get it there, eventually, after several tweaks and restarts). There are occasionally framerate issues. 

Pros: The AI isn't non-existent. It's visually pretty. It's functional. co-op/multiplayer works well. I haven't had any crashes.

There isn't anything to spend scavenging points on. The stuff at the vendor is always trash. None of Remis skills really excite me. Ditto with the talent tree. Its all kinda meh. I can't speak for the other characters.

To top it off, I played an hour and a half longer than steam permits for a refund, so now I'm stuck.

Abilities not working properly
Item pickups not working

And here's the biggest kicker I was willing to put up with it until this bull happened my teamate crashed and the game deleted their frikin character so 9 hours of playing completely reset but guess what steam doesn't care its still 9 hours on record so screw us right no refund.

Performance:  It struggled to run properly until I updated my graphics drivers and set the game to windowed mode, now it's flawless.  I hear console players are struggling a bit more.

Content:  It's not an action packed non-stop roller-coaster like some of the ads suggested.  It's basically an abandoned town setting with a few groups of humans and the random vampire scattered around.  There are main quests, side quests, repeatable quests, open world enemies, many many chests/bags/trunks to loot, and from what I hear... a whole second map after you finish the first one (I haven't finished the first map yet, cannot confirm).  

Quests:  The main quests are fun and not cookie cutter.  There's definitely stories to go along with them, if you choose to read them.  You get side quests from NPCs at your main base and from the ""Safe Zones"" that you unlock.

Setting:  ""Spooky"" doesn't do it justice.  Between the music, the lighting, and the little details strewn about, it can get quite intense.

Replayability:  There are several methods of ""grinding"" (for xp/loot) like the repeatable ""Nests"" and the ""Rook Storm"" just to name a couple.  

Difficulty:  There are three difficulty settings at the start (easy, medium, hard) and ""very hard"" locked until you beat the game.  I've been playing on ""hard"" since the start and I find it just challenging enough.  I die occasionally but I feel strong when I wipe a group of vamps or gunners.  I look forward to playing the ""very hard"" mode.

The ability to upgrade/customize your own base.
Improvements to human AI (vamps seem fine).
More performance improvements.
More encouragement to play multiplayer.
The ability to join random games (can currently only play with ""Friends"").

Redfall,1294810,137801020,"At present I would only give Redfall a 6/10 and recommend waiting for a sale.

Here is my reasoning:

I have been a fan of Arkane since the release of Dishonored, which I thought for the time was rather unique and innovative. Dishonored II then really fleshed out the specialness of that universe while building upon an already solid foundation. Every time I play either one, I am intrigued by the lore, architecture, and allover aesthetic, so much so that I am hoping for another game (but we shall see.) But then came PREY! My god was that game an underrated work of art. From the beginning I was absolutely drawn in and immersed! I remember forgoing sleep just so that I could progress a bit farther the first day of release. It is a beautiful, startingly distinctive game that I have played for more hours than I care to admit. The neo-deco architecture, alone, was enough to reel anyone in, never mind the actual gameplay, and the requisite and beloved Arkane “play your way.” 

Deathloop, initially, I thought was a bit of let down; however, once a year had passed and a major update was released, I revisited the game and played it for two weeks. This game, too, revealed Arkane’s ability to create fascinating worlds and addictive gameplay. I also count this as a triumph for the studio.

Then we come to Redfall, which I already had reservations about considering I knew it was going to be coop (sorry, but imo a lot of us are introverted enough that this is not appealing, but certainly each to their own); yet, I was excited because Arkane had yet to fail me. I will not go so far as to say they have failed, rather I will say that they released an incomplete game that needed a lot more work despite having already been delayed. Somehow this game looks less realistic than Deathloop (which was released in 2021), and the world of Redfall, while being significantly more interesting than the world of Forspoken (wow was that a shitty game), pales in comparison to more recent open world releases like Horizon Forbidden West or Ghost of Tsushima, or even Ghostwire: Tokyo. The cut scenes are just drawings, the stealth kill is an absolute joke devoid of any significance, and the powers—though awesome—are somehow forgettable. 

While I do like the atmosphere that Refall is creating, I think it would have benefited from a fall release when we all are in the mood for Halloween and the general creepy atmosphere of that time of the year. The moodiness seems somehow too dichotomous to May, but I guess they had already delayed it enough (I’m being facetious—they obviously had not delayed it enough). On another note, I am irritated by the game’s character creation restrictiveness. Where it claims again to be “play your way,” only allowing certain powers to be accessed by playing certain characters is not “the way I would play.” Furthermore, though the vampires are intriguing, they quickly become boring and predictable, and rarely are frightening or too threatening. As always, the voice acting is superb, but the architecture and design aesthetic is mediocre and rarely innovative, and—at times—also forgettable.

I do appreciate that Arkane Austin was attempting to do something new and that should always be applauded, but I believe despite having ample time to work on the project the game somehow still needs more time to cook. In fact, as it is now, it could have been released into Early Access and I think it would have been more liked.

Main Ingredients:

1.75kg (3.5-4lb) boneless chuck roast

2 tsp coarse salt, divided

2 tsp black pepper

2 tsp (30ml) olive oil

3 cups (700ml) water or beef broth (can add wine)

2 cups (300g) parsley root or parsnips (Max says you could also use a turnip)

1.5 cup (15g) torn parsley leaves

1 large onion, chopped

Ingredients for the sauce:

6 medium eggs

0.5 cup (120ml) white wine vinegar

0.5 tsp black pepper

1 small head of garlic (2 tbsp), peeled and crushed

Method:

Wash and dry your roast, then rub it down with one of the teaspoons of salt, and the pepper. If the roast isn't trussed, tie some twine around it just to help it hold its shape.

2. Heat the 2 tsp of olive oil in a dutch oven or a large pot on the stove, over medium high heat.

3. Once oil is shimmering, set the roast in the pot and brown on all sides, 8-10min. Then remove the roast and set it on a plate.

4. Now add the parsley root or parsnips, the parsley leaves, the onion, and the remaining salt to the pot and cook until the onions are nice and tender. About 8-10min. If it looks too dry, add a bit of olive oil.

5. Then pour in the water to deglaze the pot, making sure to scrape down any brown bits from the sides and bottom of the pot.

6. Then add the roast back into the pot, along with any juice that has come off of it. Make sure the liquid is at least half way up the side of the roast, adding a bit more if needed.

7. Let it come to a simmer. Once it does, cover the pot and set it in the oven at 375°/150°C for about 3.5 hours. You'll know the meat is cooked when you can insert a fork or knife into the meat and twist with very little resistance.

8. Take the pot out of the oven, carefully removing the meat and letting it rest on a platter.


To make the sauce:

1. Whisk the eggs.

2. Whisk in the vinegar until smooth.

3. Add in the garlic, and the pepper, and whisk to combine.

4. Take a cup of the liquid the meat was cooked in and very slowly add it to the eggs, whisking vigorously the entire time so that you temper the eggs and they don't curdle.

5. Put the mixture in a saucepan over low heat, to slowly warm while you whisk for a few minutes. Do not let it boil, or it will curdle.",False,21,25

Redfall,1294810,137797643,"In the interest of providing some positive feedback for Arkane Austin and encouraging them to stick it out with this game, I want to go against the grain and state that after about 9 hours of gameplay I'm actually rather enjoying Redfall.

I found the opening intriguing and am curious to learn more about the story, I'm enjoying the open world roaming around New England, and I love the weapon variety and quirky side quests.  It took me about 1 - 2 hours before I started to become immersed in the world and the mood, so for those struggling I recommend trying to play a few hours with friends before giving up and determining the game is not worth your attention.

I have not had major performance issues, though there is some noticeable frame rate stutter and texture pop-in issues.  Still, I have yet to encounter anything that was persistent or game breaking in terms of bugs or rendering performance, so honestly those were not showstoppers for me.

Overall, I think this game has a solid foundation upon which Arkane Austin may build with future patches and expansions, but currently I think it's a hard sell at its present $70 price point, even though I still recommend it.

If Arkane asked me to provide advice on mitigating the launch, which they haven't and most likely won't lol, I would recommend promoting it with a discount in the near-term and working on stabilizing the game (performance, bugs, etc.) as well as providing expansions for the player base.  I would also recommend providing those expansions for free as a $70 entry fee is already substantial and warrants some love to the players who keep the game alive.  

Anyway, I'm having a good time and intend to continue my journey through Redfall, even with the negative feedback.  Hoping this review can provide some context for anyone else looking at trying out the game - good luck!

The game has various types of bugs that are common to see in multiplayer games but nothing that has made me get frustrated with the game if anything just makes me laugh as you see an enemy slide across the screen but we know it will get patched soon as this is the norm with games these days but it didn't stop me from carrying on.

I do think the price for this type of game should be lower or should have had a lot more graphical polish made to it so its less fortnite looking and more art styled or realism looking and much better cut-scenes rather than the slide shows.

When it comes to gameplay I found it fun to play alone and with friends, some characters are better than others and could have been better abilities to make them feel more unique than a basic healing class or sniper class.

The game feels very much like a casual game to play with friends and a grind for better guns while playing on harder difficulties as the dusk level is very easy for solo players and even on hard with friends is still pretty easy but its nice to just switch off and have fun with friends.

The story is a bit weak and predictable which makes it feel like the mechanics and style of the game was chosen before the story so you kinda switch off with friends and solo you feel like you want to skip some of the cringe dialogue depending on your character.

I like that the vampire nests and wish they had done more with it or added some other things like this to break up the repetition in the game but sadly it can feel repetitive once your in the second map area.

Its a shame this game is getting so much hate as its still a fun game despite its flaws but could have been much better and maybe if the price was lower then maybe it would of been received better but this game does not deserve all the hate its getting.

---- I have now completed the game and must say this game is the sort of game you could see in a discount sale bin for £5, I think even if Arkane let it cook in the oven for another year you wouldn't see much change, this feels like yet another failed attempt to make a live service game which has all the markings of what you would see in a live service game, so once  again it looks like another Anthem failure of a game, this game needs a few years to turn it into a live service, this game really should of been aborted in its current state as not many will buy the season pass or even want to play a second time with a new character.

So I would honestly say there is no point waiting as I doubt much will change with this game and would only say buyer beware and don't spend any more than £10 for this and play it with a few friends while your drunk so you can all  speed run it on the mediocre hard difficulty while laughing at its flaws. ---

Having been an avid fan of Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop, Redfall does not live up to their legacy at all, and falls short in so many ways.

AI is lacking and horrible compared to their other games and enemies don't feel alive, weapons and powers feel lacklustre, controller default feel is spongey and bad until adjusted a lot, graphics aren't up to scratch given how much performance it requires to run, and what could have been a great world and setting to explore feels empty and really lacks that spark their past games had.

Really hoping that it's updated and patched to fix all the issues, make the world feel less empty and enemies feel more alive, please fix it Arkane, it really could be a great game. But at present I wouldn't recommend it, and if you are really keen on it please wait and see how it's patched first.

Redfall,1294810,137789456,"Last edit: I have finished the game. I loved when the main character said it's REDFALLIN time and then the Red fell. It was such a joy.
For real, this game houses unmeasurable amount of glitches and bugs, some of them are the most extraordinary and insane ones you could have ever seen. Idk how deeper the rabbit hole goes. Beware at all costs or burn your money and lose your mind.
I thought it'd grow in me even a little but it really didn't. It's just an unintuitive & lazy game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't mind putting a negative w/o finishing it. I don't think there's much to see.

This is the most generic game ever. 2 hours in and first thing you notice is (aside from horrible performance) how generic the game is. Generic open world, generic interior designs, some cluster of enemies and unnecessary loot dumped over here and there. Storytelling is very plain and boring (whatthefuckever it tries to tell) it's almost a visual novel. Static images mostly and voice acting over it during the cutscenes. For real? It's good when it's used right but if that's everything you serve to us, if that's the core of your mission briefing, that's simply lazy. The soul of the game, the vampires, are just a bunch of fucking geeks with some of the most simple animations they could ever had. AI is kinda dumbfuck even for a guns-blazing game. I have no clue what they have thought when they were making this just another looter shooter cuz if I must remind you last 3 or 4 looter shoters have absolutely sucked (and yes, even Borderlands 3). Speaking of BL3 or maybe Destiny 2 none of those games have a gracious campaign but they have a shit ton of fun gunplay. Redfall does not have it either. It is also quite obvious mission design won't save the game as they are go to x, do the y type of missions (well you can argue most of the games are like this though) without any substance. But given how trivial Destiny campaign felt compared to its actual universe or how cringe was the BL3 (both also have the most generic mission designs) they had enough core gameplay to have you go for it. I just don't see what'd you lose if you were to quit this game in 2 hours. But out of curiosity, I'll keep going. 

Well, it's just 2 hours in but I have that strong feeling I am playing a dogshit. And I swear I tried to be as unbiased as I could ever be. Even soft gaming journalists cannot justify this game's existence. Arkane Austin is not as acclaimed as Lyon however Prey was just a decent beginning, a sequel could have been great. Instead they wasted time and effort on this, asking shamelessly for 70 fucking bucks. I have no clue when the development began how much Microsoft intervened and whether Zenimax were involved in these decision making processes (we had another dogshit Wolfenstein game very recently so... I wonder if these are all a coincidence). It was an obvious dead on arrival and guess what? It's dead on arrival. This is equivalent to the story where Square Enix was unhappy with Deus Ex and Tomb Raider but they still insist on publishing niche jrpgs (therefore making some of the most generic cheapass games ever). Nobody can earth can make me believe this game deserves 70$. It doesn't even look like a 50$ AA game. A Prey 2 project was most likely to create a better revenue despite the first game was heavily overlooked. I just don't understand what these mofos cooking. They think a soulless and baseless co-op/mp game insta sells? 

Do yourself a favor and nuke this game out of the earth. Even for 15$ (thank you Nvidia), it's laughable. When one of the most reliable studios on the earth (which published critically acclaimed back to back for years) dare to release something like these... It's simply over. Arkane supposed to be masters of well thought level design (as well as the overall world design). These guys have made an unique puzzle for Dishonored 2 that you couldn't cheat via internet. And now, they copy pasta some safehouses without any shit in it. From Clockwork Mansion to this shitty town... They used to have some creativity which they have seemingly lost at this game due to having limited class abilities and of course they had to be unintuitive too. And, people are at fault because they were expecting a good game? I'll go as far as saying anyone who liked this game has no fucking stomach. I have been gaming for over a decade as well and this is one of the most harsh downgrades you could have ever seen. Now, they have a chip on their shoulder to restore our faith in the industry and whatever left of their studio.




Edit: Given how hard I treated the game I'll give the credits where they are due. Unlike some, I did not find graphics ugly or outdated. It's very Arkane-esque which is always very welcome by me. I like the art design here too and it does not look any worse than Deathloop. The art design of the enemies are kinda cool as well. They are somewhat unique on their own. But these are all there's to it, unfortunately.


Edit 2: I have tried co-op with a (moronic) friend and instantly regretted. Not that cuz my friend was fooling around but the game is incredibly frustrating when it's played co-op. And this supposed to be a fucking CO-OP ORIENTED GAME? You need to wait for a friend when you are down (classic) and as far as I am concerned there is no way to give up. When you guys die you obviously go back to the nearest safehouse and the most mission requires all players to be there to progress. That's complete bullshit. I also dislike the gameplay loop where you keep losing money every death as well as your ammo. Just lame. It's better rushing this shit solo. Otherwise, you will feel like as if you were supposed to play Ready or Not and you are swatting fucking vampires. Not a chill co-op experience.



Edit 3: So... Apparently some of the objectives are not marked on the map (Fall Like Lightning mission, connect the antenna objective as a specific instance). So if you happen to forget where was your objective you should just gtfo and youtube it right? Interesting indeed. And, I don't know how I forgot such a critical feature like this but... You can't pause the game. Even if you are playing solo. That was the exact moment I knew I was playing a bad game. 



Edit 4: There are 2 point of no returns in the game. I have not any sort of warning popping up for either of them. Chances that I missed it? Slightly but it's still possible. While the ending does make sense why it doesn't let you free roam after finishing the game it's the absolute worse choice for a game like this. You probably will leave the game half way through the level limit. I don't even know why the fuck is the level cap is 40. That's way too much. On the other hand, not that because I care but regardless I'd have wished there was a free roam option in the open world after completing the story so people could have freely grinded achievements and 100% the game. Going through this dogshit campaign would be an absolute chore for the most of achievement hunters.

jacobs ult is bugged where it will aim 3m to the right of anyone you aim at.
its graphics are somewhat lacking with a lot of muddy textures and sometimes just straight up see through textures.
a lot of t-posing.
it is not what have come to expect from Arkane.
it is badly optimized with stutters left right and center. (wich has yeeted me off cliffs on multiple occations)
its gameplay loop is pretty much do quest get safehouse complete objective if you want to then teleport back to hub and rinse repeat.
while exploring the world there are very few quests to be gotten outside of safe houses and hubs and there is not really much that would suggest that you need to search for it.
co-op left me on loading screens forever on multiple occations where if i load in singleplayer it does so instantly.
i wish they would have postponed it and released it when it was done instead of making it feel like another cashgrab.
the most fun i had with this game was within the first hour of this game outside of that it got very sluggish and no big incentive for doing stuff.

This vampire game, despite its promising features, has some bugs. The game has some similarities to Dishonored, but some mechanics are problematic. For instance, some enemies can get stuck in the environment or simply stop acting, causing a game-breaking situation.

Additionally, the AI system is not optimized and often takes longer than expected for enemies to react, leading to inconvenient combat scenarios. I found difficulty in navigating the environment, with objects blocking your path, making it challenging to progress to certain areas and making the game difficult in some sections.

Despite these bugs, we should remember that the game was recently released, so much of what is said here may change. RedFall is a pleasant game with a great story and fascinating gameplay mechanics that we can enjoy with friends. The game has a lot of potential, and we hope for new updates from the developers.",True,2,398
Redfall,1294810,137782331,"Redfall is an amazing experience. Not a good one, but an amazing one. You will at every step be confounded to experience the absolute nadir of game design and polish, the sort of thing you'd expect in a ten-dollar Unity asset flip, not a 70-dollar ""AAA"" game. The main challenge in explaining what's wrong is really where to start.

But let's get the obvious out of the way.

Is it really as buggy as you've heard? lmao, yes, YES. And so much more. Erronous world states forcing game restarts, connection issues, keys not responding, not being able to read things after someone else in co-op has read them, the game sending you to wrong fast travel waypoints, geometry issues and floating objects that look bad, geometry issues that create holes you can get stuck in, issues with models and animations, the screen being obscured by various garbage so you have to restart the game, dialogue attributed to wrong characters by the closed captions, NPC's duplicating themselves and carrying on two conversations at once and so on. It never stops.

But I can personally ignore bugs, even quite bad ones, in favour of good gameplay. Does Redfall have that? No. Is it perhaps because I am expecting the wrong thing and Redfall is a different type of game? No. Because Redfall is bad at being EVERY type of game.

Looter-shooter: Incredibly low variety of things to loot and things to shoot, weapons never have interesting or gamechanging modifiers, enemies are levelled with you, not with areas or world states, so gear levels are just treading water to keep parity, nothing else. Trash.

Horror game: Nothing about this game is scary, you are never in any way encouraged by any gameplay elements to do anything other than run forwards and shoot things. Stealth is irrelevant. There is never any kind of reason or motivation to avoid being discovered.

Bog-standard FPS game: Enemies are braindead(don't take cover, often don't notice you) which means that a lot of FPS mechanics(taking cover, approaching carefully, thinking about tactics) don't matter. There isn't even any kind of penalty for getting killed, you don't even need to restart events or anything, so there is absolutely zero tension.

Immersive sim(????): This is not an immersive sim, you just shoot things. Go to hell.

Zero-challenge walking sim with an engaging story: lmao, just, lmao. The story might as well not exist. The characters are dull and superficial.

A co-op game: You know? It has one thing going for it. If you're playing in co-op you have someone you can laugh about the bugs with. But the thing is that the encounters are never challenging enough to make the tactics available to a co-op team worthwhile or cool. Plus, having played it briefly in singleplayer, there are about half as many, maybe a third as many, enemies in co-op and they're much less responsive or dangerous. It is idiotic. I refuse to believe any human being ever playtested this steaming pile of garbage.

And part of what makes it really sad is that in the first like... two hours of the game, my co-op partner and I were super impressed by a lot of environmental detail, like you can zoom in on almost any text in the game and read it, even bulletin boards and stuff. But then at around the halfway point they just started copy-pasting stuff and a bunch of plaques and things had clearly AI-generated not-quite-text on them, etc.

I used to really love Arkane. I got excited for all their games. I kept wishing for a Prey 2. I now really hope I never get a Prey 2, because then I would be insanely disappointed and the future *possibility* of a good Prey 2 would vanish. 

Just fold this studio up, it's over, I can't imagine the sort of person who'd buy another game of theirs after trying or hearing about Redfall.

Visually, the game is stunning, with its beautiful graphics and impressive combat mechanics. The combat is engaging and enjoyable. However, I wish that there were more weapon varieties available for each weapon type, as this would add an extra layer of diversity to the gameplay.

The mobs are a little too easy, especially in multiplayer mode. However, I am still in the first area of the game, and things may become more challenging later.

One issue is that mission progress is not shared in multiplayer mode, which means I have repeat quests if I am not the host. This can be frustrating if you enjoy playing with friends or joining random groups.

Graphically, the game has a lot of settings to tweak, I am usually able to get between 50-80 fps with settings between high and epic using DLSS at quality mode. This is on a RTX 3080 at 3440x1440 resolution.

Overall, Redfall is a visually stunning and engaging game that offers a lot of opportunities for exploration and discovery.

Redfall,1294810,137773033,"Right, what to say about Redfall...
Its a dissapointment. Simple. Its almost like Arkane made the game with one hand behind their back, while running out of money and being pressured by Bethesda to release it.

The world is characterful and detailed in most places like you would expect from an Arkane game, like Dishonoured or Deathloop. Shops and houses are full of items and are believable. The subtle story being told through the cultish markings and unfortunate victims of the Vampire invasion are true to Arkane's brilliant story telling.
 BUT, the world is just..empty. There are so few enemies.. and what enemies there are can all be killed without you taking a scratch, in seconds. Streets are full of market stalls full of detail, picnic benches, and parked cars. All with explosives, power boxes, ignitable oil, or detonatable cars. Environmental hazards to help you fight the vampires. The problem is, there are never any enemies to fight you near them. Ive been downed more by me shooting an electrical substation and it electrocuting me in a fight, than the vampires.
For content ive played the game for about 5 hours at this point, on Midnight difficulty, the equivalent of Hard at release. All of which has been done with coop with one other person.
Enemies die instantly, to a single pistol shot to the head. Which is cool, guns feel powerful, but it makes stealth gameplay, something Arkane basically specialises in, pointless. Even in the tutorial it suggests you sneak past some cultists. Why bother? You can kill all of them with a simple headshot. Enemies seem to wait about 3 seconds to before they choose to shoot at you, Vampires, while slightly more challenging can be dispatched easily with a couple of shots while their attacks are easily dodged just by walking backwards. Its almost as if the devs put the game in easy, low population mode for testing and forgot to take it out of it again before release. Where are all the civilians? Did they all go on holiday prior the the Vampire invasion? You find the odd person to rescue, a few in safe houses, but other than that, they  are clearly all dead or turned into cultists. Weird.
Weapons are far to frequent, with you getting legendary weapons straight out of the gate. The looter shooter system is pretty basic and you cant sell weapons in the traditional sense, instead you just scrap things  which gives you dollars/credits. Picking up random items in the world, like brandy, pipewrenches and packs of toilet paper (a covid joke which I appreciate), also awards you with cash. The shops are basically useless however. Weapons like the stake gun need nerfing as you can easily 2 shot a boss with it, and im only level 5... Enemies as a whole need to be tougher,  more frequent and far more intelligent. 
My buddy and I set off a shop alarm while breaking in, and expected a horde of vampires and cultists to swarm us. Despite the building across the street having enemies in, non came.

Lets talk about graphics abit. The game is on Unreal Engine 5. Some of the cool new physics are present, but overall, while the game does not look bad, its hardly looks next gen. This i think is more to do with the art style. Arkane has always had a very cool, dystopian art style, with over accentuated, grim, almost caricature like characters. This is evident in the vampires and player characters design and proportions, but it is much more subtle than something like dishonoured. The colour palette of the game is similar to their other games with subtle pastel tones, however its like a ""Lite"" version of an Arkane game. Where as Dishonoured lent into the style 10/10, Deathloop about a 8/10 and prey about a 6/10. This game is only about a 2/10, as if they wanted a hint of their other games but nothing more.
Sound design is good, with decent music and the voice acting for the most part is enjoyable. The characters interact well to each other (I played as Dev the plucky British cryptid hunter).

Coop worked fine but you can only host a game then join in. You cannot join mid match and no matchmaking. So thats bare bones. 
Bugs, game is buggy as hell. Enemies that are immortal and cant see you are semi frequent, forcing me to reload the game to fix it. Nice to get close and admire the character models and hear some of their passive dialogue but other than that, annoying. T-posing characters, jittering in the floor and enemies stuck in floors to name but a few.

I really hope they patch it and improve it and don't just abandon it. At this stage im enjoying it for what it is, but only with the hope that it is improved upon. I cannot recommend buying it now. See if they patch it. 

Arkane, I am dissapointed in you. Let people publicly test your game next time, and remember to test it yourself, because, if you did and didnt see these flaws, then you deserve the negative press you are getting.

Redfall,1294810,137771422,"Game is not great. Its far from the worst game out there, but the myriad of bugs and some wonky design choices really ruin what was probably a different version of what they wanted from the outset. Awful experience singleplayer, but passable with friends. 

-First off is the performance. Its pretty bad across the board. It has constant frame stutters when just walking around, and drops FPS to the mid 10s for a few seconds while stuff loads in/enemies do things.

-Next off is the AI. Oh boy are they braindead. Kinda wild how DIshonored from over 10 years ago got it fine but this one messed up so badly. They will prioritize repositioning or going for cover despite you being 2 feet in front of them. The damage is completely random, from no damage to 2 hitting you. Vampires AI is pretty basic as well, as they only have a lunge attack and a teleport attack.

-Next is the UI. I don't know how to explain it, but its by far the most unresponsive / unintuitive / buggy mess that Ive ever used. A window pops up every mission complete, that you have to HOLD DOWN to close, which takes up half your screen and prevents you from using melee. The UI constantly is wrong, where ammo counts dont update, quest objectives disappear or stay on the map when complete, getting locked in the pause screen, or simply missing basic features of a loot&shoot like marking guns as favorite/junk to easily scrap or delete.

Design choices.
- The character's abilities are neat on paper, but they dont really work with how the game goes. Medic character is useless, Dev is OP with their teleporting and god tier lamp ultimate, Layla has ups and nothing else so you might as well play Dev, and Raven guy has awful lines and skills that should be more powerful than they are.

- Its 2023 and coop games STILL don't do saved progression. I cant understand why developers think this is acceptable. NOBODY and I mean NOBODY wants to play a game with dozens of useless quests and annoying side missions more than once unless they are playing with a new character (and if your game actually is worth replaying which this is not.) Their reason for not doing this is nonsense too, as their are zero choices in this game that do anything, and even if there was, it encourages a new playthrough, rather than having to replay the stuff you already did. At least character specific levels and items are saved, but still.

- The skill tree sucks. All the abilities that you get should come as basic parts of the main skill. 

- You can only hold 5 health packs and 8 lock picks. Why?

- You all have to be in proximity of an objective to activate it. Or accept a mission, or pick up random things. Do it like Dying Light and let us teleport to them if theyre waiting. Or dont do this.

- The guns are pretty mediocre. Theres like 10 legendary guns and only 2 of them are actually good. The rest are mid or garbage. 

- The nests are a huge waste of time. The rewards from them are always trash. And you're better off just doing stuff to get the Rook to spawn and kill him. He drops good stuff sometimes.

- Characters talk over themselves and others constantly.

- Final boss is the biggest waste of time. Once completing it, you get credits, and then NG+, with no chance to keep playing your save.

- Cant go back to the first map once you get to the second. Why?

- Cutscenes are cheap and still and not worth watching.

- Story is a cool idea, but the rest of the game makes you not care one iota about it.

- Music and sound is fine, but the glitches either mute it, or make it simply not play.

- No drop in drop out coop. You have to play from the lobby. 

- You cant pause the game, even in singleplayer. ????????????????????????????????????

- No gun trading / dropping. Not a big deal, but a looter should probably have this feature.

- Enemys seem to level up with you. You dont really get stronger, you only get more mediocre skills as you go. Weapons are level based, so as you level it forces you to use new guns, which is fine, but the weapon amount is so limited that hoping to get 1 of the 2 useful guns is a pretty weak gameplay loop, which this game boxes you into. 

- The game would probably benefit from some random stat buffs/nerfs per weapon so it makes looking at the gun's stats actually mean something rather than throw everything away that isnt an orange legendary. \

-----------

This game feels like it was a different game but was changed to a coop game mid development. The UI feels like it was either subcontracted to someone else, and thus ran into the same problem Halo Infinite has, or was done in the last week of development. I expect more for a CDN$ 90 game and the studio that put out Dishonored and Prey. It feels like every skill/ability for every character was combined into 1 large skill tree for a single player game, making it interesting and fun to play with builds and playstyles sort of how Dishonored did it.

Its such a shame this game turned out like this, as itll probably affect how the industry looks at these style of games with distaste as they 'don't sell well' or 'arent fun' which is a lie. Borderlands, Dying Light (1), and even some roguelites like Gunfire Reborn and Risk of Rain got it right with their weapons and gun play, and even they had a story akin to what Redfall was trying to pull, but where Redfall fell flat with their design choices, Borderlands and Dying Light excelled because it was fun to play and had some memorable guns, weapons, story, characters, dialog, and SHARED STORY PROGRESSION! Redfall has none of these.

-

Story - 4/10 
The ideas are there, and the concept is real cool, but imagine if this was a Wizarding World game and Harry Potter had the personality of drywall who was annoying to listen to.  (Not to say this world comes even a step close to WW's universe.) Puddle depth characters, still exposition ""cutscenes"" and a lack of a real narrative makes it not worth it to pay attention to. The only dialog you get is 1 of 4 quips/banter between the characters or a guy whining about his weird bird. The villain gets a better story than the main characters.

Gameplay - 3/10
The lack of abilities and how they make you feel strong makes it a chore to do anything the game intends you to do. Its more appealing to just run past everything to get it over with faster.

Graphics - 6/10
I get the style they were going with, but a game from 2023 should be better. Higher poly, more dense foliage, better lighting. Its the Unreal 4 curse.

Performance - 2/10
With graphics from 2010, a game like this should run flawlessly on any mid level machine. I suspect Denuvo is the culprit here, and companies should take note of how their game is seriously impacted by it. At least it was playable at ~28-40 FPS on lowest settings.

Sound - 6/10
Music and guns sound good, although theres too many bugs that affect it, and the dialog keeps overlapping making it a headache to linger in the populated safehouses.

UI - 0/10
It straight up barely works. Im amazed I could finish the game with it. Stop with the press and hold to do basic actions, like buying or closing a menu. Trying to find some mission logs with images for clues was a chore and a half.

Design - 2/10
The flat abilities and lack of guns in a Loot and Shoot makes me question what happened to the game. Design couldn't have been this bad from the outset, and if it was it raises questions of what M$ and Arkane was thinking and if they have even seen a successful Loot and Shoot, or if they just threw a dart at a board with game genres and went with it.

-

Overall - 3/10 A disgrace for the legendary Arkane Studios. Thats two game in a row that missed its mark horribly. M$ needs to seriously look into their leadership at Xbox and see why almost all their new games in the past few years have been commercial disasters. Its hard to even pretend to stick up for Xbox and M$ at this point when Sony has been killing it with quality games for the past few years.",False,129,743

And for the most part I actually enjoyed the game, sure the AI is garbage and there are obvious issues, and even though they shouldn't have existed in the first place they could easily be fixed.

Now below is gonna be some spoilerish information, its not going to spoil the actual story of the game but it is going to spoil mechanics of what happens when you beat the game.







So I beat the game....and you know what my reward was? I had to completely restart the game without warning and had zero choice in the matter, and I cant go back and undo it or load a past save because thats another choice the devs made.

When you beat Redfall you will be 100% forced to start over in a NG+ you will have all your gear and stuff but you start completely over. 

There is no warning at least not one I saw it just happens. There is ZERO and I mean LITERALLY ZERO end game max level is 40 and after beating the game and doing ALL side quests I could find I was level 24, and from what I can tell XP doesnt scale in NG+ or with difficulty so you will have to beat the game probably close to 3 or 4 times before you would even be max level but all max level does is mean your build doesnt matter because you will be able to get basically everything.

Also the difficulty you have to unlock, feels like it changes nothing, yes the enemies hit a little harder and have a little more health but outside of that no difference, they are just as brain dead.

I would have given this game a 6/10 maybe even a 7/10 it was nothing amazing but I had fun the entire time I played it and that is all I truly care about.

Redfall,1294810,137769324,"Beat the game. 20+ hours spent figuring this game out. Here is an honest review after trying almost everything. This review is from a  SOLO experience. 

Cons
-Lack of Story depth, its what we seen hundreds of times with zombie horror games all they did was replaced the monster. They going throw in some sob BS side quest. Evil megacorp made monsters. 

-The human AI isn't just bad, its corrupted and broken They try to take cover, rush you or sneak up on you but they don't have terrain awareness. They are constantly running into walls and tripping over boxes. Now they do significant damage when they do hit you. Killing you in 2-5 shots on normal difficulty( Dust). Vampires have similar AI problems but not as bad. 

- Character builds are uninspiring, and don't exist. All you do is max your main damage skill to bypass the STAKE mechanic. They don't make your character feel  or play any different. It all comes down to how many bullets you have and whats the best gun you can find. 

-Loot, I've only seen 6 guns repeated out of the 10 times killing the Rook( loot boss that always grants a legendary). They say vampire nest are best way to get loot but farming specials to get the Rook to spawn is far more rewarding. Legendaries spawn inside the safehouse if you refresh or keep buying and selling items. Had 3 back to back legendary items from just spending cash at the base.

-Boss fights, Outside of the first boss the fights are not difficult with minor gimmicks.

- Only 6 vampire variations. Exploder, basic, invisible, one that drains you, grappler, Shielded, and the Rook that calls down lighting strikes. Few will experience shielded or the Rook.

No public matchmaking. Game that promotes co-op but doesn't allow you to pair up with randoms? Yeah some people can be horrid at the game but the point is share your experience with another person. Only the host saves story progression. Whats the point of playing together if you have to wait for the one Host friend to be on to continue gaining progress? 

Pros ( not many)
- Gun play feels good but it lacks some features to make it better. Guns vary, same model have different attachments, bonuses etc.

-Legendary loot looks and feels good to use

- Abilities at least on the character Dev feel very powerful and useful
- many ways to approach a fight, enter a building 

Verdict. No! Not even for Bethesda. We won't tolerate a buggy mess for $70. Studio that made Dishonored, Copy and pasted ideas from Dishonored. What this game plays like, Dead Island, not the new one but the decade old one that came out over 10 years ago.

in the end it was a little funky but.... man was it worth the wait. i would have been thrilled to see the game grow specially with the plan the studio had but.... they got shutdown. and i can't help but feel a little responsible over it. i should have remembered all the good games they made, and hadn't been rash.
To whoever who had  part making the game, I'm sorry. And to those who haven't played it, get it on sale, that way its worth it.
P.s Mind that all i played is the offline mode. so basically single player. I cannot account about its functionality on multiplayer.

Previous review :as the game is all i can say is, i wasted A lot of money. Lots of people are talking about performance, multiplayer issues, etc.
but when i pay a huge sum of money and can't even pass the menu... that says something.
at least others got a glimpse of the game, all i saw was leaves rolling in the street for the price of 70 bucks since it refuses to connect to servers. and with it being an online only game, i can't wholeheartedly recommend the game.
maybe in the future my opinion will change once they give out a patch to fix the connection issues or i fix it on my end. but as it is rn, im really disappointed. i feel robbed.

After considering the possibilities I've decided to refund the product. the price is simply too high and I haven't seen any move for fixing the connection issues.

Redfall,1294810,137765109,"I was super hyped for the release of this game, I mean it’s not often you get to play an open world vampire looter shooter (if ever). Normally I’m an absolute sucker for games like this but man, they really needed to let this one cook longer. Like a LOT longer. I rarely buy AAA games at launch and when I do I’ll always wait and check the reviews for this exact reason. I mean I didn’t even spend my own money on the game and I’m still somewhat disappointed.  I don’t run a triple A game studio myself but I just can’t understand the thought process behind releasing a game in this bad of a state for $70 with the promise of fixing it later down the road whenever the only thing that matters in the court of public opinion is first impressions. It doesn’t really matter how good this game is in X months time on sale for 50% off since everyone is just going to remember how poorly it launched.

You know the saying diamond in the rough? Well honestly, absolute best case scenario Redfall would be a ruby, maybe a sapphire? Right now it’s still coal and here is definitely no diamond tier game to be found underneath all of the bugs and horrible performance. The game feels like not only did the developers underperform but they also half assed other aspects of development. Like with the playtesting and optimization. They added nvidia dlss 3 so surely that will bandaid fix all the performance right? Wrong. And this is with a delayed game release already.

So what’s wrong with RedFall exactly? Well, the game’s problems range from poor optimization and performance to the game’s absolute hot garbage enemy ai to numerous bugs/glitches and honestly in my opinion on a somewhat fundamental level, the gameplay loop of the game itself. 

First off I really want to talk about the “open world” of Redfall. I’m going to use this selling point from the game’s website which is what really set my expectations so high for the level design. “Redfall is a true Arkane experience set in a rich world that blends the familiar with the extraordinary.” A rich world is a bit of a stretch here but okay. “Redfall’s open world is handcrafted by the master level designers behind Prey’s Talos I space station and Dishonored’s Dunwall.” This line is what had me both excited for and disappointed with the resulting game. “From the town’s once-bustling downtown and the haunted forest to the decimated seaside boardwalk and beyond, you will fight through cultist outposts and supernatural psychic spaces as you piece together Redfall’s many mysteries.” The only mystery here is where all the level design budget went. Setting aside the game’s poor graphics and the frequent visual and lighting glitches, the open world feels barren and largely copy pasted. Most buildings are blocked off and lacking interiors plus the way that areas are designed feel really sloppy. While its’ not really promised anywhere there aren’t any hidden secrets or loot around the map, most of the roofs and areas you can explore are just there for the sake of being there (if you count the gravelocks as secret loot they are NOT hidden unless you count a giant glowy object in the corner of rooms you already have to go through as hidden). 

Another thing that is really lacking in Redfall is the game’s story. The npcs are there for the sake of it, they rarely talk or interact with each other if at all, and quite frankly I would go as far to say that I think the only “interesting” characters are the 4 playable ones. And almost every story cutscene in the game is just a slideshow of still images with a bit of dialogue over the top so it’s even harder to get immersed and feel attached to any characters. To make matters even worse, a lot of the game’s story is hidden behind readable objects. I don’t think the occasional readable lore dump is a bad thing in games but there are so many objects that you can read ranging from useless bits of background information to huge walls of text that may or may not be lore relevant or interesting. Honestly after a while of playing I just couldn’t be bothered with reading anymore of them. Here’s what I can say about the story, a quick dumbed down version if you will: Blood experiments gone wrong, evil doctor guy goes mad with power, vampires take over town and block out the sun, people go cult mode sacrificing their neighbors, you can’t leave the town so time to kill them. That’s basically about it. 

The next thing I want to touch on is the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop. Effectively the game revolves around you getting a quest to go to a place and grab/do X, fight some bad guys then teleporting back and getting another quest and doing that quest after quest until you fight a boss or special vampire then repeating. There aren’t any changes to break it up and to me it just feels like “hey we made a boring map, here’s a boring fetch quest to do over here in order to have a reason to even visit any of the points of interest”.

Lastly I want to talk about what makes the game all but unplayable (at least for me personally). To me the worst part about playing this game is a combination of the really awful performance and the unfulfilling combat. Everybody has a different standard when it comes to how well a game should run but for me at least, an average of 60fps with frequent frame drops in combat situations with all settings turned down to low while having roughly the equivalent of the game’s ultra specs is NOT good enough. So how does this tie into the combat exactly? Well, the combat itself has a ton of problems, the two biggest ones are the horrendous enemy ai and the way that the guns feel to use but I also hate other small things like how the game doesn’t pause at all and the enemies will constantly respawn. Even with all the cool and interesting weapons at my disposal, every time I have to fight enemies it’s a complete drag because of how janky each encounter is. Nine times out of ten the cultists that shoot at you are braindead stormtroopers and on that rare once in a blue moon encounter they are complete crackshot monsters. Most of the time the vampire enemies are constantly teleporting and leaping at you, which let me say good luck hitting them when it feels like you’re playing the game from the toilet in a hotel across the planet connected to your pc via your friend who is streaming the game through discord. 

So is there even any potential with Redfall at all? Well basically here’s how I see it: give the game some time to cook and then buy it on a deep discount or play it on xbox game pass. The game is nothing to write home about but I’m sure after improving the performance and getting rid of some of these bugs it will be a solid 6 or 7 out of 10 experience.

- The biggest of all, the AI is so awful, I played it on hard, and it's like a walk in the park, all ranged enemies have 2 modes, in one they just stand in open areas and start shooting missing like 90% of the time, you can even skip almost all the fights running without getting hit, and the second mode is running right straight towards you, it's kinda of funny to see like 4 or 5 guys running , all aligned in a row towards you,  and like 20% of the time they got stuck in invisible walls or corners until you kill them or leave combat
- And second problem, is the half empty world. In my roughly two hours, I  decided to explore the world and some buildings but half of them were empty, even the bigger and taller ones, inside they have a great atmosphere, bodies everywhere, claw marks, halls full of blood, even the music changes to something more dramatic, but then nothing, it's all empty, and the ones that weren't , they just have 1 vampire or a group of 3 or 4 enemies.

The world feels lived in initially and while I had fun exploring the empty and abandoned housed it turned out that almost all my houses were empty and abandoned. Aside from the small spot of cultist or an occasional vampire there was next to no shooting in my looter shooter. We believe that enemies may grow more dense as we reach higher level but to get to that point I would need a game to play and not a walking simulator. 

The combat is simple with vampires having 1/4 gimmicks (mostly easily avoidable attacks, strafing makes you near unkillable) and a bunch of cultist with guns (the real threat on the highest difficulty available by default.) I have found a fair variety of weapons but at this point its the lack in variety of enemies is my biggest cause for concern. Each characters individual powers are neat but they do not quite feel as game defining as I would have liked, gameplay feels more tied to the weapons you enjoy vs what your person can do. (I am not max level maybe this will change as we reach much higher levels)

As things currently stand I cannot recommend purchasing this game, I will update this as things change if you could get the game for $30 or less I would recommend it.

-Open world... two separate maps... and it feels barren. The vast majority of the houses and buildings you come across are not even accessible. The ones you can get into feel boring and bland.
-Balancing within the game is not fun at all. Its actually just boring combat wise. A.I. just dodge spam and teleport behind you. That is if the don't just spawn behind you in the first place.

So far I am enjoying this game. Is it the best game ever.... no. Is it overall fun.... yes. There are some bugs like several times I ran into vampires that were bugged that they were basically living statues that took no damage and did nothing (don't attack, can't die but they just sit there talking until you move far enough away for them to despawn). Other than that there have been a few objects that are floating or clipping through objects (like a film reel clipping through a table in the movie theater). The game for me kinda runs like crap but that isn't a major thing in my opinion. One annoying thing though is the red mist crap and difficulty kinda gets weird. So the red mist just takes pretty large chunks of your health away every few seconds you stand in it. For difficulty I am playing on the easiest difficulty but like out of nowhere I started running into scenarios where they spawn in a bunch of enemies that just obliterate my health bar or the one side quest boss stays around red mist and can pull you into it both taking a chunk of your health with that attack and then you start dying by the red mist. 




Big issue if true
One thing I might have an issue with, I haven't gotten there yet but apparently you can move to another location (like you start out in the town of Redfall and apparently there is another map) and when you do that you can no longer return to the previous map. Also there isn't a new game plus option so once you do that you can't return if this is true they should change that at some point since there are collectibles on the map and I would want to have the option to go back. They should add a New Game Plus mode or after beating all the campaign missions allow us to go between the two maps. But right now from what I have read I don't care for that. Apparently they do give you a warning of if you go forward you can't come back kinda thing.

Hopefully they can extend the life of the game and add some replay value to it (right now it's basically beat the game with each class then it's over to my understanding).

Redfall,1294810,137760182,"::Initial Thoughts::
My opening impressions of the game before playing were the teaser and the controversial gameplay showcase, and neither impressed me. But as a passionate fan of Arkane, I bought the game on release anyway. And to my relief, it was better than I had been led to believe. I would like to point out that I have only played the game single-player so far, and that’s the perspective I am using in this review.

::Gameplay and Story::
- The vampires in this game give it a surreal, campy, and semi-spooky atmosphere, not unlike Buffy or an 80's horror. Every nook and crawlspace has the environmental storytelling that Arkane's known for, making it fun to explore even the most unassuming tool shed or bathroom. Overall the town feels well crafted and (recently) alive, like it’s worth fighting for.
- The gunplay feels weighty and responsive and the fights feel satisfying - when approached correctly. There’s a Borderlands vibe with the gun collection and sorting, making the looter-shooter label fairly accurate.
- The powers are visually interesting while adding an entertaining depth to the combat and world navigation. While it is fun playing alone, there’s the sinking feeling that the powers could be used even more efficiently and creatively together with other players.
- The story is just fine so far. There’s a high air of charisma from the player-characters that contrast quite well with the ""quietly surviving"" tone of the NPC's as you assist them. There's an overarching story that unfolds as you progress, but as I haven’t finished the game, I don’t know where it’s leading. Overall there’s nothing trailblazing from the story, but it seems perfectly suited for a game of killing vampires and soaking in atmosphere.

::Thoughts on Multiplayer::
Marketing for this game enthusiastically promoted this as a multiplayer game. I was concerned there’d be a hollow feeling as I played the game alone. As if the game would always pressure me to invite friends or frequently promote co-op only features. This was NOT the case, and the choice seems to lie solely on the player’s preference.

::Critiques::
- When you're not fighting something spooky, you're fighting a human cult/gang member. I figure this was for variety’s sake, to not overuse the beastly things and have them lose their sense of suspense. But they certainly are less interesting, and it feels like you fight them more than vampires.
- The default ADS is not 1:1. It's much lower than the mouse sensitivity making it quite cumbersome to counteract. As of now there is no option to adjust this.
- The overall game difficulty is relatively low. I'm playing it on 3/4 difficulty just to feel threatened. I'd probably insist on playing it on 4/4 difficulty if I were playing with friends. But to play on 4/4, you first need to beat the game on any other difficulty. If I wasn’t planning to play solo my first run anyway, I could see this being frustrating.

::Final Thoughts::
- When first starting the game, I picked the author, but didn't really vibe with it. So I started over as the psychic college student and enjoyed it more. This just to say, you might want to try out a character or two before settling in for a playthrough.
- I haven't read any of the other reviews yet as I wanted my first impression to be formed in a vacuum. But I do know the price is kinda steep and the reviews don't seem very positive right now. If that worries you, you'd probably only regret your purchase. Better wait for everything to cool off or wait for the eventual sale.",True,10,541
Redfall,1294810,137760152,"Morbius II The Quantum Morb... This game has already made morbillion dollars mor than cyberpunk. Thank you Sony. 

I regret activating this game for free onto my steam account... If you regret it too, you should rush through the game right now before the AI gains a consciousness/intelligence after one year of patches, otherwise you might have to spend an extra 2 hours to fight competent AI. You know what you can do with 2 hours... watch Morbius with renown actor golden globe winner and nobel peace prize winner Jared Leto. Currently the AI are braindead lobotomites, which ironically makes it slightly enjoyable in a sad way. So best to play it now while its terribly funny bad rather than a year later when its just terribly mediocre (food for thought hmm).

How arkane fucked up after fixing these AI issues in deathloop is beyond me. 

Even after its fixed, game will probably be mediocre at best.

Man, I feel bad for those people with performance problems.
This game has been running quite well for me, no lag or nothing. 
I actually don't mind this game at all. The world is beautifully created. The story could use a little bit more mystery to keep you interested in it.

Although the game ran fine and I had no technical difficulties with it, I can't believe I finished it after 23 hours. I would say at this point the game was worth about $30-$35.
The game was good but not good enough for me to want to replay it on higher difficulties.
I'm going to change my rating from thumbs up to thumbs down based on the game's value. I don't think it's a $70 game. I would have gladly paid $70 for a game like Skyrim or The Witcher 3. I've replayed those games because they were so good. But not this one.",False,0,1427

is it bad gameplay? .... eh? It's not bad per se, just pretty repetitive.
Not the worst thing to be but since singleplayer works better than coop, it can get lonely and boring. I bought it, might as well keep going. Simply there wasn't the most love with this game it feels like. More like it was an experiment. I feel the next game will be very good but till then, wait for updates and you know ... don't expect too much.

other problems I have with this? leveling feels ... lengthy. there are a lot of nice upgrades for your characters but it takes a while to get the exp. for it. if you did nothing but quests then maybe, but I am very explorative, and I feel I should get more exp. out of searching around and doing a good chunk of the side stuff.

characters? great. I was iffy on devinder (i think that's how the name is spelled) but he actually has some very nice abilities. if you wanna mess with coop, he would be a good pick if you are against a horde of vampires. assuming you have the 3rd ability available. 

if you are going solo, be careful. Though the game is kind of easy on even harder difficulties, it doesn't mean anything if you get overwhelmed by over a dozen vampires. If you get a UV light weapon, keep it equiped if you feel something is wrong about an area.

Loot? very easy to get once you understand how it works. [most of this was observed in singleplayer] The highest level weapon you can get will always be your level at the time of getting it. The grade (color) of the weapon can be anything, simply RNG. Gold weapons are always special but you will eventually have to salvage those too, as you level up more and more. There is all kinds of boxes and laid about gear to find what you need. But also check shelves and closets closely, there can be something small but useful like a gold gun on the back of a shelf above your head. There are also random items that is basically money, like in dishonored.

Redfall,1294810,137757408,"TL;DR: I assume 95% of the reviews posted thus far are by people who got through the ""tutorial"" mission and decided the game was trash so don't trust most of the reviews here with ""0.10 hours on record"" because that's nowhere near enough to get a fair feel for the game. Maybe wait for a Steam sale to pick this one up, it seems like a $30 title rather than $70 but overall, it's been a decent ride. Gameplay is smooth, open world fills out as you unlock more content, and the open world is very vertical, so maybe try climbing before assuming there's nothing to do. 


Let's rip the bandaid off. Not sure this is a full-price game. I'd say wait to get it at a decent discount from what I've played so far. The AI is not fantastic, and that's my biggest gripe, but in general I'm having a lot of fun exploring the world and making my way through the early missions. Also, to be transparent, I'm not having any performance issues. I have a very high-end rig, and the game runs just fine, but that may just be a little ""ivory tower"" syndrome. 

I feel the need to step up and defend this game a little, however, from all of the smoothbrain takes here. 

People are complaining the ""open world is empty"" then have like 20 minutes in the game. Did you even try? As you complete progression missions, there's more and more that is being added to do in the world. There's also a lot of verticality to most of the world. There's a lot of buildings you can't just walk into, but you [b]can[/b] parkour up to the rooftops or climb scaffolding and get into a lot of places via a higher floor window. I've finished roughly 5 main missions, and the world is starting to fill out with more side-objectives to complete, so it takes some time to ""unlock"" those features. Sure, this is a little linear than most people would expect from an open-world title, but them's the breaks now and then. 

Secondly, I've seen some reviews of people who have 4 - 6 hours in the game and their review claims they have beaten the whole story and I find that dubious. Now, I'm not speedrunning the game, and I'm not sure how long it is, but with around 4 - 5 hours myself, trying to see more content than just the main story, I'm only - as I said - about 4 or 5 missions in. 

Maybe the game's main missions are super shallow and if you just bust your way through only story missions, you can finish that quickly, but I expect the story missions will take probably 10 - 20 hours to beat, at least? I just seriously doubt that - even at breakneck paces - you could beat the whole main story so quickly. There's no published speedruns of the game yet, so there's no fair frame of reference, so I just may be overestimating the length of the story. 

Ultimately, I feel like this is just a bandwagon ""review bomb brigade"" where people spend 10 minutes in the game, decide that progressing to unlock features is for chumps, and refund the game because a lot of the takes so far are hot garbage.

That being said, however, it is still absolutely not a 70 dollar title. With the state of which this game was released, it should have been priced as half as much. I think I speak for just about everyone when I say that I wish it was a 70 dollar game. But quite frankly, it just isn't, that's just the sad truth. Arkane is capable of much more.

Most of the negatives I have towards this game are not even that major and it really just needed more time and polishing overall. I would have loved to see more variance in the weapons or even had somewhat of a workbench/crafting type system to customize weapons. I feel like the idea of jury rigging guns to fit your needs fits the post apocalyptic overtones the game has already and would have been a nice touch thematically and also mechanically speaking. It also would have been nice to have more fleshed out skill trees for the characters. It should have more meaning as to which path you wanted to specialize in rather than just slightly enhancing an ability and getting a few generic perks. The npcs also have little to no variation and their AI is honestly pretty abysmal. It feels like you're either being absolutely lasered by an enemy while behind cover or you're watching them run slowly and aimlessly in circles with no in-between. And, as ""open"" as the world may be, it also feels so empty for a majority of the game. 

Gunplay overall feels alright and I don't mind the ""cartoonish"" graphics some people have commented on. To me, it really is a style choice. The story overall was also sorta okay despite having the cop out comic book style ""cutscenes"" from npcs that have little to no depth.

In short, if you can play this game for free through game pass or are getting this on sale for at least half off, it's decent enough to sink a few hours in and forget about it afterwards.

To touch more on the lack of content, when you advertise an open world co-op game and make it possible for players to be on different parts of the map doing things, they could have put more things to do. Mob camps, or events. While a friend and I were playing we were about to take on one of the mini bosses and wanted to charge up or ultimate ability before doing so. To do that you need to kill vampires or those weird blood statues. We ran around the map trying to find vamps to kill and after 30 minutes still didn't have our ults fully charged. That...is not exactly a good thing lol

I definitely wanted this game to be good. The premise is great, a vampire hunting game with 4-player co-op and an open world created by Arkane (Dishonored, Deathloop) so I thought: Count me in.

However, the launch is HORRIBLE. I tried to ignore the IGN reviews of the gameplay being shoddy. Optimization is horrible. I have decent hardware (3070 RTX, 9900K overclocked to 5.0 GHz) and I had to fine tune the settings to see 60 FPS, and even then it's very unstable - you can tell the game is loading enemies because of the hard stutters I experience.

The gameplay is NOT smooth. Playing this game with a controller and even M/KB is crap, aiming and fine tuning your crosshair is not existent. In order to get better feedback, you have to use a higher sensitivity with the input speed set to low. Why isn't this the default?

There aren't any cutscenes in the game either. Everything is a slideshow with dialogue. Hell, there's not a single interactive NPC in the game. For $70 in 2023? No.

I'm merely leaving a positive review with the reminder that Steam the past year has been plagued with fake ""poor optimization"" reviews or reviews of that kind that were fixed within 24h of game release and thus not relevant any longer yet not adjusted. While games can have issues, the added army of fake reviewers on Steam the past year has gotten out of hand and even highly praised games get hit by this to the point that I'm not entirely certain if it's coordinated malice or just bots targeting everything. So take optimization reviews with a massive grain of salt.

I'm also leaving this review as a reminder to look the game up yourself through content creators you find trustworthy, rarely if ever trust Steams user review system as it is incredibly flawed and neither positive nor negative is necessarily a good measurement of what the game truly is.

It adds to the ""a vampire can attack me at any point"" feel and plays into how bad the vampire infestation is. Just try the game for yourself. Or watch some gameplay on Twitch or YouTube to see if it's your style of game before buying.",True,0,740
Redfall,1294810,137750801,"What a great concept.

This game was hyped from when it was announced and I was all here for it. I bit but this game did not bite back. On top of paying $70 plus the bite back addition DLC pricing this game wasn't even close to that tag. 

The largest problem this game has is it's identity, it has no clue what it wants to be. It had this great lead in with vampires restricting a Massachusetts town and wreaking havoc on it's inhabitants. The problem comes in the lead in when you start the game! It feels non existent, it doesn't set up the story at all, even if it was trying to make it mysterious like you need to explore and figure out the story for yourself it doesn't entice you to do so, Between large areas of the empty town and poor AI enemies that are few and far between, and aren't positioned well like they forgot to load them in. Its overall poor delivery. They took a great concept and hype and came up seriously short. 

I feel like this game shouldn't be open world, like it just wanted the tag to be a selling point. The game feels like it's wants to be a mix of Days Gone/Dead Island/Borderlands. The story is so weak trying to force the open world concept and not guiding you through or setting up the game well at all. I feel they should've played more like the Left for Dead series, multiplayer co-op with Vampire enemies and a clear story set through mission levels. One of my other biggest gripes was not being able to take multiple quests from the mission table, you have to take one at a time when being displayed multiple. Upon quest completion, the next quest you accept you're going right back to the same location to do something else. Entice the player to explore your open world you created! Also, all of the levels ups and completions give this red text like an old Ghost busters game/Stranger Things text. That was just nitpicking, but I will say the level up jingle does tickle my fancy, most likely my favorite thing of the entire game.

There are so many different directions they could've taken this game and the concept was so promising. I really really wanted a stake melee weapon (right off the bat when you receive the stake in the firehouse) instead of a stake bayonet on just a few guns that you're basically forced to switch to, it feels wrong. I don't really love the characters either. The NPC's story feels like they're just there and not very involved. I don't want to force this game into Left for Dead or L4D2 but the Cola Guy who unblocks the highway to the mall has more charm than any NPC I have met in this game, you never even see the dude too! Maybe I wanted this game to live up to that game, which still plays phenomenally btw, considering it being a four player shooter PVE with a revive system against Vampires (much like zombies).

There's a famous staple in immersive sims: even if it doesn't do anything, the toilets should be able to be flushed. It's part of showing the player that the gameworld is meant to be a real place; that it doesn't exist simply as a combat arena. Ironically, flushing toilets is just about the [i]only[/i] ambient interaction you can do in Redfall. There's no clutter to pick up and use to distract enemies, no drawers to rifle through, no bodies to search.

I don't understand the negativity surrounding this game. The game runs fine for me, outside of a few frame drops, usually happening when loading into new areas and only lasts about 1-2 seconds, with Epic settings/DLAA + Frame Gen I'm able to maintain 140+ FPS with no issues. I might be more of the exception and not the rule though. Also, I thought games were supposed to be about fun, from what I've read a lot of people are having fun with the game, so why all the negative reviews?

The game looks fine to me. Graphics are fine for the art-style they're aiming for. Yes, I know there are missing textures and reused assets, but if you're more worried about things that don't even affect game play, then I don't know what to tell you. Seems like people forget that a lot of open world games face these issues, it's not new, it's not recent, and it's going to continue to happen.

This game is basically Borderlands with Vampires. Gun play is fun. It's gratifying when unloading into a bad guy,  and there's tons of guns to find in this game. I've only played about 2 hours so far, but from what I've seen and experienced, it definitely seems like it's going to be an enjoyable experience all around. I'm also loving the environment it's got a creepy, Stephen King small town vibe to it, and when you're up in the high areas like the mountains overlooking the town, to me it was a sight to see. Lastly, the co-op, now I've never been one for co-op, but the option is there, and from what I've read is actually really fun.

Could this game have used a few extra months in development? Sure, extra development never hurts, but for what they released, to me at least, is a good product, a product in which you can see the developers put their hearts into it, just a few minor bugs to be ironed out like the frame drops, and enemy pathing, and some AI issues, and you'll have yourself a very solid product.

I've had a few issues of stuttering and lag, mostly when loading into new neighbourhoods. And the occasional ""You have 0 medpacks"" only for me to heal and the number actually reflect what I was carrying.

- Update after approx. 6 hours (3 hours of co-op, 3 hours solo): Game is still decent. I would say that there are definitely some areas where the A.I. is often lacking and making dumb decisions, and there are bugs/issues in co-op such as letters becoming unreadable if someone else interacts with them first (though they still get added to your log). Overall me and the gf are enjoying it and taking our time to just explore and do missions as we come across them. Hopefully the performance issues and A.I. are addressed in patches sooner than later, and I would personally like some quality of life tweaks such as the little robot companion not being so obnoxiously loud (actually that's probably the #1 thing that has particularly bugged me since it's so annoying to hear stomping around all the time).",True,1,328

The rest of the time the game was running in the background because i was in the bathroom throwing up because of the motion sickness i got from the game(Yes it was that bad). The graphics made it very clunky and even though i turned off motion blur etc i still feelt sick from it. I have never experienced this with any other games but it looks like im not the only one with this problem. Bought it beacuse it looked like a fun game to play with some IRLS but we all got bored instantly of it because after the first mission it was the same all over again. Its simply not fun(and for some reason it really fucks ur senses up to the point of puking). Would not recommend.,False,2,379
Redfall,1294810,137741563,"I honestly don't know. I think it has lots of potential. most of my issues were the same as others out there. Enemy AI is dumb and boring. I think I passed up 50 med packs over the course of an hour and had used 2 the whole time, and once was my fault. The first vampire mini boss died in less than 10 seconds and hit me once, with white lvl 1 weps on and no skills yet. We like a challenge! 

Speaking of, why in the heck does leveling up take so long? My whole time I only hit lvl 2? out of 40! I've read that beating the game only gets you lvl 20/40 and that's ridiculous and not worth it. No one wants to do 2-3 full playthroughs of the same guy, just to get max level. 

There's some bugs but they all seem fixable. I didn't encounter as many as others have, nor did i have any FPS issues on 2160p Ultra. 
I took my time and explored every corner of everywhere I could and man... There's just nothing there besides currency items, med packs and the occasional pistola that I had 7 of already.... even after I found a lockpick and went back to a locked box, was junk inside. The next 3 lock picks were the same with one giving me a shotgun, which was cool, but then i got one about 2 min later as part of the story.... smh.

Again, these are all things that can be fixed and patched and I really hope they will be, because I was and sorta am excited to play this game. I love Borderlands and Destiny, Division and Diablo and any Looter and/or Shooter. I Frakking LOVE skill trees and builds. I think this game has the potential to be a lot of fun and much better than it is and ill be happy to purchase it again at a future date, for a cheaper price. I already thought that the ""new"" $70 price tag they're trying to shove down our throats is ridiculous to begin with and 99% of the time, I simply won't get it on principle, with the exception of something like FF7R2, which is not only my fav series, but if its 2/3 as good as FF7R, then it's worth it and I believe its gonna be even better. If you wanna charge $70, you better make sure it's worth it and up to the standards of ""better than a $60 game"".

That all being said. My first 2ish hours was decent. I played 30 min with a buddy with no hickups and then a fresh guy up to level 2. I was ok. Way too easy, Not enough loot or interesting or rare either. Stealth was ok. Guns were fun. Graphics are fun. The lore seems cool and excited to see the story. The characters all seem great with varied skills and lots of builds to try. Coop. Lot's of positives to go with lots of negatives that hopefully all get fixed. 

Last thing i forgot was something I watched cause I didn't get that far, but you HAVE to retool the perks on the weapons. No one wants a bunch of lazy, passive stat boosts. Especially if there's not a good amount of gear to play with, which there's not. So you have to make the weapons that much more interesting!!! Perks that augment the skills in the skill tree. Power up, change, whatever, but I wanna pick up a legendary that has a perk so good that it makes me wanna change my build around to try it out, or boosts my current build to make me OP feeling. You can even steal ideas from Borderlands and Destiny n such, but anything is better than passive stat boosts like acc +10 or DMG +20 or add 2 rounds to your mag. 

Ok, sry for the super long rantview... But I've been really excited about this one for a long while and broke both my rules of, ""DON'T PREORDER"" and ""DON'T SPEND $70 ON A BASE GAME"" 
and I'm just really bummed. Please read this and everyone else's and fix it so I can change my review and I'll/We'll  be back!!!!

I'll start off by saying... If you have people to play with, or enjoy just solo stuff and shooting things, this is an ""eh"" kind of game. It's a game. It's fun to play a game. That's all this is. It's not terrible, it's not great. It's not like it hurts me to play it, I've actually been having an alright time with the game so far, but... I got the game for free, so... If you can get it for free too, go wild. I would recommend trying it out if you can get it without paying 70 bucks. If you just have 70 bucks that you want to blow on something though, sure, why not. 

If you don't have friends that want to play this with you, and don't want to just play solo. Well... Just forget this game exists. There's no matchmaking. That already is a complete interest killer for a ton of people.

I haven't had any crazy bugs, crashes, or anything, and the AI is... I mean, the AI is about as threatening as any Far Cry game, it's not very smart. You can snipe a dude's friend's face off right in front of him and he'll just stand there like nothing happened. If you're looking for difficulty, yeah, not here. I've tried the game's settings on easy, medium, and hard, and I see very little differences. I have yet to see what the super hard option is like, but hey, considering what I've seen so far, and what I've heard other people say, I doubt it's going to be that much harder.

This game... It's not worth 70 dollars. I will say that for sure. It's a alright game, but it's a 20 dollar purchase, easily. As it is, at this current price, without matchmaking... I'd give it a pass. If you can get it cheap, or on gamepass, cool. If not? Pass on it. Go play Vermintide or something.

Bugs -- there are alot...not sure how they even went live with this many bugs this is actually embarrassing...not even going to list the bugs i went through lol...

it becomes VERY repetitive near end game content...you will have to grind grind grind quests to just get to the last boss which is beyond stupid for a FPS game

This game actually had potential to be great, they rushed it tbh terrible company if they let it out early like this 100% they knew all these issues before releasing.

it's a decent 1 time play through type of game nothing memorable from this game though

you know what baffles me the most though and why i give this game a thumbs down? because everything i've said so far is something you can overlook tbh if you're into stories...but what i really found dumb was...it took 4 years to create this FPS game and they only have 7 different TYPES of guns of which you will more than like use 3 types of guns only! such a rushed game not sure why...but it got ruined from it's potential...not a terrible game but nothing memorable either.

TDLR:

Not worth the price atall, prob worth  $15 on the high end $30..

if you're bored it can be fun solo but only one play through def not something you'd want to play more than once

Redfall,1294810,137737592,"Purchased on a ""bundle"" platform. Performance wise, the game ran just fine for me. Epic settings at 1440 with DLSS on stayed pegged at my 140 FPS limit. Even ran it upscaled to widescreen 4k the first couple hours and it hovered around 110 FPS. Micro-stutter was barely noticeable for me.

The game-play and the world however are far from what I would expect from Arkane. The AI is very noticeably poor, making hard difficulties almost laughably easy. The gun-play just feels... off... somehow. The world is empty and dead, and at least in the first few hours all there is to do is either the target fetch quest objective, or collecting random junk that instantly turns into cash in your bag when you touch it and/or excess guns laying around, which you then scrap for cash in your bag. That actually felt fine initially, but it didn't take long to realize the only benefit of looking through anything in the world was, A.) to find another flavor text note someone left, or B.) to hope you might find a better gun laying somewhere. Which I already had two top tier shotguns two hours in and nearly every gun I found was just a pile of coin in the shape of a gun. 

If this were maybe a $20 game I probably wouldn't complain and would just take it for what it is. But this is coming from a triple A company, and is up there among probably the top five or ten most expensive games I've purchased in the last few years.

I've refunded my purchase. Might buy this again someday down the road when it's on a very deep sale. And hopefully they've improved the game some by then.

Redfall,1294810,137737201,"I never write reviews but on this particular occasion i felt it is a must for anyone thinking of buying this game. I have played most Arkane games including the old school Dark Messiah Might & Magic, Dishonored 1 & 2, Deathloop, Prey even Wolfenstein Young Blood. So with that said..

Graphics: Not something Arkane is typically known for in my opinion. Most of their games are artistically beautiful not graphically (except Deathloop and Wolfenstien even though it wasn't their engine). But Redfall just looks very dated and somehow looks worse than their previous games.

Gameplay: Its not good enough to be a looter shooter (which i personally love) and not really a good Far Cry game or Arkane immersive sim game. It doesn't give you any choice of approaching each situation different except a different entrance into a building, interesting gameplay loops or interesting character powers to play with. It be fun to run around and shoot vampire as that idea is still novel but the AI is dumb as a bag of bricks.

Sound: A step back from again Deathloop in every way i think but guns do sound punchy

Story: I know this will piss people off but i don't think ARKANE is particularly good at telling a traditional story in any of their games except maybe Deathloop or Prey. But what they are masters of is environmental story telling, awesome worlds, lore and setting and again in every way Redfall falls to live up to that legacy. Barely any story, world is boring to explore, minimal environmental story telling and so on.

Overvall: After many patches i think this game will be decent enough time to spend with friends or solo to run through this when there's aren't a lot of games coming out. Otherwise i would strongly to avoid this game. Even as a hardcore Arkane fan. I will beat this game but will be waiting for patches.",False,4,865
Redfall,1294810,137737101,"I think the negative hype may be somewhat unwarranted. It reminds me a lot of the Borderlands games, though with a Arkane art style. As such the story isn't as compelling as it might otherwise be, but it is funny and entertaining. Is it groundbreaking or incredibly compelling? No. Is it a fun time? It can be.

Performance for me is high enough I turned on Vsync to keep from needing to run my GPU to high, though it does drop to 60 fps in some places. This is without using DLSS or other techniques. Though my system is on the higher end of the spectrum. It hasn't crashed on me so far either. It does have graphical bugs at times like floating baddies, but It's no worse than many other games that have had such issues at launch.",True,8,1640

Bullet-point list of all the stuff I encountered in my one-hour co-op session:

- Flashlights are local-only and seem to work by increasing brightness in a cone of vision like how they do in Half-Life 2. This would be fine, but because this is a co-op game you can't use your friend's flashlight to your advantage.
- The characters have psychic powers but they were almost never as useful as simply shooting enemies in the face to kill them.
- Shader compilation stutters were constant and made me think I was playing a game on a Wii emulator. This is a problem endemic to Unreal Engine 4 games on PC from what I understand, but it was too frequent to be ignored.
- Many ""distant"" objects Z-fighted until we got close to them and then the higher LOD models were able to resolve that.
- Nearly identical weapons are impossible to tell apart on the inventory screen (a model of shotgun with a red dot sight and the same model of shotgun without a red dot sight have the same icon).
- At one point my character was running around pantomiming holding a gun but wasn't actually holding one in the eyes of the other player. Really wish we got a screenshot of that but I don't want to put any more playtime on this than I have to.
- If you hide behind a car, the enemy AI can't pathfind its way to you.
- They do the horrible pretend mouse cursor thing on controller instead of just using normal menu navigation. I know why they're doing this, because Destiny and Project Wingman does it, just to name a few. I hate it there and I hate it here. If I'm using a controller I want to navigate around the menu directly, not pretend I'm using a mouse.
- Tree pop-in that makes Pokemon Violet look good, seriously.
- Loot is instanced, but if someone is looking through a chest another co-op player can't look through it until they're done. This has lead to my my partner mentioning guns that we can't see ourselves or get a hold of. This confused us both greatly until we realized loot was instanced.
- Your player characters will frequently fail to pick up ammo. No matter how many times you press the button. No matter how many times you walk away from the ammo and come back. Similar to the previous issue.
- Having two nearly identical weapons makes the weapon switching button Y fail to switch weapons on a controller,
- The inter-character dialogue is very uninspired and overall feels quite forced.
- The cutscenes are ken burns effect vignettes of dramatis personae doing actions like cleaning the firehouse. It reminds me of the kind of animation quality you get when you need to finish the TV season but you ran out of budget, just like the last episode of Evangelion. THIS IS NOT A COMPLIMENT. The last episode of Evangelion is much better made than the cutscenes here.
- Alt-tabbing out of the game gave you a 2% chance that it will just lock up. It made having a second monitor for replying to Discord messages irrelevant.
- We didn't choose to end our playthrough, the game just disconnected us after we finished rescuing hostages for a mission.

This needs two more years to be actually playable. Another AAA game dropping the ball once again.

My friend and I while doing side missions eventually came to the point where we one shot most enemies including bosses of each region. We are playing on midnight (the hard difficulty) and are just tearing through enemies like a hot knife through butter.

For the pros I really like the games aesthetic with a backdrop of vampires and an ocean suspended around the town preventing people from leaving.

I liked a lot of the mechanics and design of redfall.. but the ai was boring as hell, NONE.. and I mean -NONE- of the enemies were a challenge, not even close. idk what version IGN was playing but that was -NOT- what we got.

I'm going to be fair with the game without falling into the review bombing.

The game is in a Beta state. It has performance and balancing issues that can only be achieved with player iteration and time.

There is no matcking for coop op. Only by invitation you can play the multiplayer. The AI needs to polish its behavior. The stealth mode is pretty bad in its mechanics. The shotting is also poorly achieved. For an open world it feels a bit empty. The class builds are not very dynamic, to unlock the ultimate ability of a skill you have to have all of the above. They are 40 lvl max and getting to the top of a skill takes about 12 points.

I think many things can be improved with time. For those of us who pay for the game without the game pass. It's not worth the price. If you have it for the game pass and you have nothing else to play, go ahead.

I did have fun playing through it (even before the optimization patches came out), but this game could and should have been so much more... It's honestly a shame.

Buy when on a major sale, if you think this is up your alley. Because you can have fun with it. But, just be sure to know what you're getting into.

Very low quality 3D model work and low quality animations, pushes your pc like next-gen but looks like a 2012 game, very low quality AI reacting either slow or seemingly glitched, a ton of strange graphical oddities e.g ambient occlusion continuous artifacting or pitch black looking garage interiors when its light outside, confusing storyline where your character knows more than the player leaving me play catch-up, lackluster cinematics (if you can call them that), boring environments where nothing notable happens most of the time, enemy design appears unimaginative, weapons don't feel good shooting and their design appears uncreative (don't just add stakes to everything...), characters are uninteresting to deal with although I've stopped playing about 2 hours in as of this writing.

I've not had performance issues like most others aside the occassional hiccup entering zones/points of interest, it's everything else about this game that's a head scratcher. I'll be honest: you're better off getting Dead Island 2 for less than this on another platform or wait for when it launches on Steam.

Sorry Arkane devs, I know you've been pressured by your publishers to release this as-is. Unfortunately, the game that's out now is nowhere near worth the price (not even 50% off) due it simply being low quality in graphical fidelity and gameplay.

the angler's move being unbreakable is ridiculous considering how much health she takes with the move, and the rook mechanic straight up makes no sense.  you basically fill up a piss-em-off-o-meter til a rook storm occurs, and he comes down to fight you.  you die?  well, respawn and go fight him again.  there's no real penalty for severely pissing off apparently old vampiric gods, so why have this at all?

i constantly experienced chop and lag when fighting vampires, often causing me to end up shooting just behind their path for a full clip.  the damage radius of vampires and explosions seems a bit larger than it feels like it should be.  let's not even talk about how touching fire can knock off a third of your health bar, but a half second in the death mist does nothing.

i also feel like mob fighting vampires was very much designed for group play, and not geared down for solo play at all.  i've died way too many times fighting 4+ vampires, forget introducing the special ones into the mix

Sticking along with the notes from my original post, I would have liked to see more variety with the enemies, both basic and special. Additionally, the limited variety and customization in our weapons left a lot to be desired. Finishing up the game overall, I felt like the ending was a bit underwhelming.

This is a looter shooter where the main focus and lore is based around exploration. I will admit this game feels incomplete but it has great bones and it would be amazing if the developers could listen to feedback about what it is missing and add it all in.

I don't know what happened here but playing this game is like having a car slowly drive over your foot. It just keeps getting more painful.

This game has vampires so strong they will disconnect you on hit. I could hear the Killer Instinct voice ""Qua Qua Qua Quad kill"" when the vampire hit the host of our 4  player game so hard it sent him to the disconnect screen. I'm kidding, on the hardest difficulty setting (when you ACTUALLY do find an NPC to kill) the only time you are in trouble is when there is 3+ vampires and I suck at video games.

[b]Setting:[/b] I can't tell if the game wants to be serious or not. The vampires are scary and serious with serious voice acting, but its backdrop is cartoons and awful character dialog, and silly loot items. Be silly or be serious but stick to your setting. Its like a PG horror movie that was trying to go for the G rating. (Look at the Left 4 Dead setting, they had jokes but overall the story was serious and the backdrop was serious).

[b]Gunplay:[/b] The guns don't feel right, they fire slow, reload slow, and it feels like there is some issues with bullet lag or timing (could be MP only). Nothing feels good about it, its  bland. A silence wpn can kill an NPC who is talking. The now dead NPC will finish talking and none of friends will even worry about why he is dead.

There are progress gates that make you do all of the games side quests before you can start the final quest and the game suddenly refused to recognize my GPU on restarting the game so it was running the ENTIRE GAME off my CPU. I'm not burning out my PC to beat this dumpster fire of a game. I got it for free and still feel like I got scammed. 

Edit: made a Youtube short version for anyone that might want some visual proof of the jank (or a shorter version of this review): https://youtube.com/shorts/hYNhBDPzTtQ?feature=share

If I could summarize for people that don't like reading, just look up a gif of someone sighing and leave it looping for awhile. That was me the entire time I played this game.

Seeing this happen to Redfall and Arkane is kinda like when I watched the Seahawks, my favorite team, throw the ball at the 1 yard line and get intercepted instead of running it and winning two consecutive superbowls in a row. 

Arkane has an *amazing* catalog of games, Prey 2017 was probably one of the most genuinely great games I have ever played, and yet here they are, pulling a Ubisoft and releasing an unfinished, half baked game that barely runs on solid hardware. 

To start with, if you have any interest in this game, I would NEVER tell you to go spoof an email to get gamepass for a dollar and play it there. That would be morally wrong, and you shouldn't do that instead of spending money here on steam ;)

Lets get this out of the way at the top. I have an RTX 3070, 10700k and 32 gigs of ram. I should be able to run any functional modern AAA release at ultra settings with at least 60fps on 1080p no problem, and I normally do. I feel like my rig is fairly representative of what most people playing new AAA games are gonna have, and Redfall absolutely CHUGS. The main problem (a few people in my chat surmised) was my 3070 only has 8gb of VRAM, whereas everyone saying the game runs fine has a 3080 or newer which all have 16+ gb of VRAM, hence the game runs smoother. Performance is dogwater for me, and for a lot of other people, not because our hardware is lacking, but because this game isn't finished in a myriad of ways, the least of which being optimization. As an example, headbob detracts from frames because there isn't a headbob in the game, but there's a setting for it, so its a script running in the background calling for assets that aren't there lol

EVEN IGNORING PERFORMANCE

The game is wholly and irrevocably half baked. I can't even try to name all of the issues I encountered, but to start, the AI is one of the worst I have seen in any game I've ever played. You can make an enemy into red mist and their patrol buddy right next to them won't react. They don't pay attention, they funnel down corridors, and thats just the human AI.

The vampire AI are either far too lethal, or far too passive. I don't think the devs found the right middle ground with them and it feels like the hitboxes on their attacks are smoke and mirrors. The game decides when you get hit, and dodging around doesn't do much. I did manage to get one accidentally stuck on some garbage cans between me and them and they just sat there attacking the garbage until I killed them. Its *bad*

The story is yet another part of this that might've been interesting but ends up being horrible. The town itself is actually pretty cool, but it feels empty and lifeless (not just because all the people in town are pretty much canonically in one building the vampires mysteriously won't attack).

All of the cutscenes are these weird, in-engine still frames with voice acting over the top, and they have these unengaging missions where you watch ghosts of people talk, but the music is always too loud to hear them? Subtitles don't even help because enemy NPCs talk outside and it covers up the subtitles for the pseudo cutscene. Atrocious. Its also abrupt and incoherent. They do a whole lot of talking and yet still say nothing, the people praising the ""lore"" of Redfall are missing brain cells. 

I chose Layla for my hunter, and I am VERY annoyed with the writing staff for having a black lady as a main character and then deciding that her ultimate ability is to call up her ex boyfriend to fight for her. Seriously lol, her ultimate is calling her ex to come beat the shit out of people. You don't even meet him, he's just an ability. There's no storyline where you save him and maybe start to rekindle your romance, nothing. Just ""I'm too weak, call my ex"" and that sends a super lame message about an otherwise badass character. 

The gunplay ends up being a worse version of Destiny, the powers aren't very interesting and the upgrade trees are absurdly boring. ""Ability does more damage, carry more ammo"". You don't get any new abilities to pick from, its the same all game and they just hit a little harder over time. 

The game, even in singleplayer is ""always online"" so you cant actually pause it (or play without internet, I assume), and I got sent a code for the game + dlc from Arkane (I was surprised too) but let me tell you what you get for the DLC. 

4 shitty outfits, one for each character (the regular character design for Layla is better than all the unlockable outfits) a skin for your stake and a skin for your gun. The gun skin looks like rust, I put it on and genuinely thought it just made my gun rusty. You also get 2 DLC characters down the road :) You know, after you've beaten the game and don't care to play anymore? ALL OF THAT COSTS 30 DOLLARS

Charging 70 bucks for this mess is already a crime against humanity, and maybe the beginning of the end for Arkane.

We're seeing a lot of the legacy-once great dev teams fall, and this feels like another. I have a feeling that Microsoft acquiring Bethesda and therefore Arkane has something to do with this being put out OBVIOUSLY not finished, so don't jump at the devs just yet, but absolutely don't buy this game. 

I'm gonna finish it tomorrow and will update if there's anything new, twitch link in my steam profile if anyone would rather watch someone else play it than buy it themselves, but I'm not expecting anything to improve. I was surprised to see there was at least one more section of map (so Redfall is just the starting area), but I'm only expecting 3 total zones at most.

Seriously disappointed in this. One of the biggest wastes of potential and quickest falls from grace I've ever seen.

Redfall,1294810,137715728,"First impressions:
Played for about 5 hours now. and I LOVE it! There is a surprising queer feeling going through me why so many have said negative things about this game. EA workers writing that negatively maybe!? Or another company. Without being too negative toward them, I found almost nothing that was bad about this game. Here we go, right from my direct honest thinking of the game:

What was good?
Everything!
1. The guns and rifles kick ass. They remind me of Borderlands + Deathloop together. The guns that glow blue and other colors are not just nice looking, they have special abilities to help with more damage and rate of fire for that particular gun. 
2. The characters are unique. They play and feel similar to the different characters in Borderlands. They have special abilities and with that, weaknesses. Just like real heroes from Marvel do.
3. Playing Online with close friends = more fun. Without a friend, you can play offline in Single Player gaming (SP). In Redfall SP is the same as Multiplayer (MP) however, with MP you will have MORE Damage! Use your abilities together to play like gods.
4. The sound is the best I have heard in many years. Yes, really. I have never heard this well done sound with glass breaking, explosions, and more. Compared to Death-loop, it is a little bit higher quality sound, and it is fucking scary.
5. Scary. Did I mention that already? I never get scared from a game, ever. Never had been, didn't think I would be. This game scares me like hell. One building where a vampire was above me - it came down and started scraping me with its claws, and I almost had total problems with breathing. I am writing to you from a man who thinks most horror movies and scary games are boring. Not here. Here it is a 10/10 fear enjoyment ride!
6. No FPS frame drops as of yet. Hell, no loading time! The game runs nearly perfect, except for a few minor glitches which are to be expected at week-of-release on my system without any problems, even with 10-15 enemies at once fighting them. Sys is: Windows 11 on Ryzen 7, with 8 CPUs / 16 logical processors. I'm running it at stock at the moment at 3.6Ghz. Game card: nVidia Geforce RTX 2080Ti 12GB VRAM. Sys mem: 32GB. Running on an SSD. The game loads in about 5 seconds for me from new launch, and levels don't have a feeling of loading at all - like .5 second wait.
7. The game is Realistic on Midnight difficulty level. The game will feel like you are in a real world trying to stay Alive. Good luck! People mentioned it's easy? Yeah, well then play more and see how long you can survive. Let me tell you this. You will need your friends to win. Without them, good luck on Midnight difficulty.

What was bad?

1. It is a little glitchy. Remember this is version 1.0. Don't expect perfect gaming.
That's the only bad part I could find so far.

Remember: Steam has 14 days to give you 100% back for your game if it wasn't what you expected from the commercials. So try it, read what I wrote, and I hope you agree!

The atomsphere is on spot.  Arkane still able to put many small details into this game. Possibly not in the same level of Prey and dishonored, but I can still see people are putting works in it.

The fighting come with some pretty satisfying details, like the execution of the vampires. The weapon is a combination of traditional FPS and some sci-fi ghostbuster technology. The enemy AI is a huge step back compare to the dishonored and prey.

The game gives you the option to play stealth, but there are zero combat possibilities to kill your enemies in a stealthy way.
The only way to kill you enemies is by shooting them and they are sponge enemies which you need to hit multiple times.
This game is feels like a looter shooter and totally not like the other Arkane games.

Next to that the game is just straight up lazy with cutscenes, these are still images/slideshows there are no actual cutscenes.

Positives

- Skill Trees (I enjoy them over not having them)
- Large World
- shooting is responsive enough...
- not laggy for me
- Lots of ""clutter"" Items and detailed environments
- different weapons, levels and designs

Negatives

- Terrible AI (VERY EASY) (VERY)
- Cartoony Graphics
- Huge empty spaces ( while these areas were amazingly full of interesting things to look at... I spent 30 minutes without even seeing an enemy.) This made the game feel very unfinished.
- The characters aren't really interesting.
- The story is not super interesting either.
- gathering supplies is becoming very repetitive
- alt tab caused mouse cursor to always be in way.
- gun play seems a bit pointless. a sniper rifle is too slow, most of the time its better to use the assault rifle like a pistol and headshot enemies. you wont run out of bullets this way. could use balancing.

There are so many other points, but these are probably the most jarring.

Redfall,1294810,137712647,"Redfall is a game that promised a lot but ultimately fails to deliver. From the outset, it appears to be a promising open-world FPS action game with a unique storyline. However, as you progress through the game, it becomes apparent that the gameplay is shallow and uninspired.

One of the biggest issues with Redfall is the lack of variety in the missions and activities. There are only a handful of missions, and they all feel repetitive and unchallenging. The combat system is also lackluster, with only a few basic moves and attacks that quickly become boring. The Vampires, which should be the highlight of any action game, are poorly executed and lack any real sense of excitement.

Another significant issue with Redfall is the graphics and visual design. The game looks dated and unpolished, with low-quality textures and character models. The environments are bland and lack detail, which makes exploring them feel like a chore.

Furthermore, the game suffers from technical issues, including frequent crashes and bugs that disrupt the gameplay experience. The controls are also clunky and unresponsive, making it difficult to perform even the most basic actions.

Overall, Redfall is a game that falls short of its promises and fails to deliver an engaging and entertaining experience. It's a shallow and uninspired game with repetitive missions, lackluster combat, poor graphics, technical issues, and unresponsive controls. I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for an exciting and immersive open world FPS game.

-Im playing on high end computer, and I didnt experience any issues performance-wise.

-I got this game for free.

-AI has good aim and vampires are diverse. However, a higher difficulty would be more enjoyable IMO.

-The price is too high for such a game. 40 bucks would be enough for it, more people would buy it and that would make a healthy player base, at least during launch considering that this game is more fun played with people.

-It would be good to have AI partners to play with when you don't have any friends ready to pay the game prize.

-Yes, it has some bugs, none of them are game-breaking (at least for now) and not too annoying to make me angry or anything

-The economy system would use some improvement, while I would reduce the amount of weapon drops making them better (=less but better gaps between weapon levels).

-Missions are a little bit silly but I think thats not something they wanted to put effort on. The game has great visuals and combat is not bad; again, it could be improved by increasing the difficulty.

Some issues with multiplayer disconnecting randomly a few times, but mostly very enjoyable. 
Didn't get very far in the story yet, but I love the characters and their backgrounds, there's so much cool lore in the game, things to find while exploring, and the team has some cool chatter when there's more players around. 

The skill trees and abilities are interesting but not too complicated, and the gameplay with guns feels entertaining and fun. Headshots are extremely gratifying. There's plenty to choose from with equipment, skins and playstyle. The world is cool and there's so much to explore!

Game looks gorgeous and runs great at constant 60 frames on a Win10/Ryzen 9/RTX3080 on Ultra video settings. Some funny graphical issues here and there with shadows and some effect shaders, but I didn't encounter anything game breaking or actually buggy that would've stopped me from enjoying the game.

Main issues:
- Shadows look blocky, pixeley and atrociously silly even on Epic quality setting and it takes away from the otherwise gorgeous aesthetic. Maybe some shortcuts were taken to get the game running smoothly before launch day? :3
- Sometimes vampires just, like blank out. They're there, floating, but they don't have a collision and they don't aggro so you can just walk up to them and admire them :D
- Occasional disconnects in co-op

All in all, the game definitely needs a bit of patching and an extra 6 months of polish, but it's clearly lovingly crafted and a lot of fun both solo and co-op! If you're going in with just wanting to have some fun and not get too serious, and not with a mindset of trying to find absolutely everything that is wrong with this game, you're gonna enjoy it, especially if you like Arkane's worlds and ""shooterlooter"" games.

Redfall,1294810,137709490,"[h1] I bought this game again just to leave a negative review on steam [/h1]

Just to get it out of the way, I give this game a 4/10 with a friend but a 3/10 for single player. Me and my friend bought xbox game past for $10 to play this game and give it a try instead of wasting $70 on this piece of crap. In our 9 hours of game play we both realize how bad this game is, without a friend I don't even think I can play past an hour. Don't even think about playing with randoms because there is no public matchmaking, yeah...$70 game. Here are the reasons why this game is good and bad(mostly bad).

Pros:
-Some variety of enemies, some vampires look pretty cool and have unique abilities
-Lots of content and places to explore and things to do so you don't always feel like there's nothing to do
-Environments/atmosphere can be pretty good at times especially when you head into these areas where it would shape shift and morph the environment as you play. 

Cons:
-The biggest Issue....AI! Ai is so bad in this game that you can say its nonexistent in this game. You can literally run around the entire world and punch these guys to death with just your fist if you want without using a gun because that's what me and my friend did. You can even go full fist against these mini bosses they have around the world. The Ai is so bad it makes the difficulty setting pointless because of how dumb they are. They can't shoot at anything even with highest difficulty setting, you can get so close you can lick their ear and they would turn around saying..""whats that."" They would run at you backwards and would literally sometimes never know whats going around them until you hit them. 
-This cost $70
-With $70 you will get no cutscenes with animations because almost all of it is just still images with your character narrating the story so you will feel no connection to the story and characters itself. Even during an investigation where you watch the memories of these characters reenacting their tragic moment, were just still frames with no animations or movement
-No public matchmaking, unless you have a buddy that's willing to spend $70(or $10 for xbox game pass) you're on your own
- Gameplay is clunky and doesn't help that the game is unoptimized with frame drops at times. 
-Shooting feels awful, there are roblox games with better shooting than this game. Pistols can't hit target at times and feels like crap to shoot, almost all shotguns feel sluggish and they all feel and handle the same. Assault rifles are the best weapon in the game currently. Sniper rifles are alright but don't ever bother trying to use them on vampires, you won't hit crap
-The characters and their skills doesn't feel that impactful to the gameplay, they can remove the skills these characters have and you will still get the same experience. Sometimes you even forget to use them
-Because Ai are so brain dead this game is very easy even on hardest difficulty, like I said you can just run around and punch people and vampires if you want. When me and my friend got to the second area for some reason everything was easier to kill despite being on the hardest difficulty setting, might be a bug who knows.
-The open world feels very bland, its as wide as a lake but deep as a puddle. There are enemy zones to conquer but their usually guarded by only 4-7 guys and almost always die to one shot, even on hard its not a challenge. 
-The side characters are terrible, they can be removed from the game and nothing will change. Nothing note worthy about any of them. You can try and talk to them but mostly all of them will either have only one line, cough at you, just a ""hmm"", or nothing at all.

Redfall,1294810,137709330,"So, i didnt listen to the bad publicity this game received at launch. I thought it was just the masses hopping on the band wagon following the horrible gameplay footage that IGN released before launch on IGN first.

Let me tell you how wrong I was.
first all, my specs, i am running with a RTX 3080 with 8gb vram, a 12900K I9 processor on a Z690 Hero board with 32GB of ram. its a fairly beefy system and even still i was getting frame drops and stuttering, for the majority of my play time it did run... okay, but the stuttering was just to noticeable during gunfights and just seemed to take what little enjoyment there was out of it. i did run the game on epic, high and mid quality, which seemed to affect the framerate very little.

during my hour of playing, there were many many graphical issues and bugs, the game itself is definitely last gen as far as graphics go, even deathloop looked better than this. the shadows were very.... wavy for some reason, very pixelated. lots of light/shadow flashing for anything further than 20ft. the shutters on the houses would sputter in and out of existence and would only fully render if you were 5ft from them. 

enemy and friendly ai was absolutely horrible. played the game on hard and not once did i ever feel challenged. hard on this feels like easy on any other fps or rpg. i would literally just walk up to enemies without taking damage and kill them, their pathing is abysmal to the point i had an enemy walking backwards to me. enemies barely shoot and when they do, their accuracy is laughable leaving no challenge whatsoever. i had enemies spawn inside bushes, or halfway through flooring, and not once did i actually take damage from an actual vampire.... ya know... the thing thats supposed to be a threat. actually, the only time i died in this game was due to a car exploding with no prior warning. no sound to give it away, no visual effects (although that may have been yet another visual bug), just... bam.

gun sounds seem to all be the same within each class, as in all handguns sound the same, all shotguns sound the same, etc etc. player model seemed to also do some weird things, while holding shotguns i would have the left arm go up waaaay to high for some reason, and during recoil from shooting, it would almost seem like my head/view would be where my chest is and my arms were above my head. .

overall, what did it for me though was the boredom. running through the world felt more like walking through a ghost town than anything else. most of the houses you cant go into, and the ones you can all seemed to require lockpicking or special items to enter. vehicles would be randomly about the place, but again, most of them were non searchable. but most notably... no enemies. enemies seemed to be very few and far in between, to the point that i was actively having to search for enemies. most of the time when you did find them, they would be in groups of 2-5 and sometimes have a vampire with them. when you did find them though, it would seem that the game is set to just keep spawning them in off screen. at one point i was doing laps around a house, and every time i got to the other side of the house, more enemies would spawn on the opposite end and it became an infinite loot spot. other times while searching around, i would hear enemies and see it pop up in the subtitles, but when you look around, there would be no enemies in sight, almost as if they were spawn or glitched in an unreachable area, like under the map or in an object.

so. poorly optimised, poor ai, graphical bugs and issues, player and enemy model issues, and..... empty and boring.

Redfall,1294810,137709198,"Bethesda lives down to its reputation.
(1) We ""pre-loaded"" the game over the weekend so we'd be ready to play on Monday. Nope. We all had to re-download all 77 GB. So... what was the point of giving us the opportunity to pre-load?
(2) My version crashed when I first ran it, then crashed again when I tried to use the Steam overlay to join my friends. All of us have had at least one crash in under 2 hours of play.
(3) My version skipped the 5-minute intro scene, which is minor, but I *like* watching cut scenes so I was disappointed having to sit there in the ferry waiting for my friends to finish the scene.
(4) We finally managed to get to the fire station, at which point the game completely bugged out. There were no enemies, we couldn't interact with anything, and the quest line started progressing as we walked through rooms. ""Defeat the cultists?"" Check, without firing a shot. ""Rescue the captives?"" Success! Even though we never saw them. We quit out for the night.
(5) Today my friends tried to start up again with new characters. Nope. The game remembers everything you picked up as your old character, so they couldn't even get off the ferry because all the guns had already been looted.

Long story short, between the four of us we've had six crashes, had to restart the campaign three times, haven't managed to even make it to the fire station with the game working, and haven't managed to go 5 minutes without some interactable object being bugged out.

Dare I say this launch is WORSE than Fallout 76?

==================
UPDATE AFTER FINDING WORKAROUNDS FOR THE BUGS:
(1) To play multiplayer at all, we learned that you need to use the fastest machine in the group. Otherwise if the fast machine loads before the host, the game bugs out and you can't play. Once you've worked that out, it's buggy but playable. It still crashes every time I launch it for the first time (so it's start it, quit it from Steam, start it again), and one of our other players had such a catastrophic crash he had to unplug his computer.  So we have it ""mostly functional"", but the machine speed bugs, saved game bugs (see below), and nightly crashes make the game painful and frustrating.

(2) Unfortunately, even without the bugs, the saved game system is still hosed. I expect any modern game to allow me to have multiple saved characters and campaigns, and to be able to save wherever I happen to be with minor exceptions. In Redfall, if you quit in the middle of a mission you lose all your progress on that mission. That's unforgivably bad programming. Also, even though you're supposed to be able to play multiple characters, it seems to store all the campaign progress in a single file so you can't host two campaigns on a single machine.
Which, combined with the, ""This only works if the person with the fastest machine is the host,"" puts you in a situation where you simply can't have multiple campaigns going at once. Inexcusable.

(3) Once you overcome all the bugs, you get to the actual gameplay, which is pretty meh. You have a handful of gun types to choose from, a Borderlands-style gun selection menu, and otherwise extremely basic movement, abilities, and skill-ups. Nothing surprising nor exciting. 
The fights are easy, the missions are routine, and it's a fairly boring paint-by-numbers first person shooter horror game. Even Back 4 Blood has a more interesting plot and more interesting NPCs.

The mobs are almost invisible especially at night. I had no idea where they were shooting from. 
Encounters turn QUICK via magically spawning mobs. 
I had once instance I scouted a building all around, saw one vamp, took my shot, I get hit from behind immediately by 4 other vamps from Odin-knows-where, stuck on a small rock and couldn't move, dead. 
One vamp ability made it stick under the map as I got it to vulnerable half poking out, couldn't end it, respawns half in, can't finish it.
Walking around an important POI and see assets just floating a foot above the ground.
Invisible walls keeping me from sniping mobs to soften the gunfight.
Some abilities characters use just don't work sometimes. Played the monster-hunter guy and the shocking pole thing the mobs just walk through 80% of the time with no effect. I tried training them through it several times, even sitting directly on it and let the vamp wale on me for a bit, whole cooldown nothing happened.
Where the hell do you get weapon stakes?! (FOUND OUT YOU DONT FIND THEM THEY ARE ON ALL SHOTTY/AR WEAPONS?) I'm using the starter shotty and the start quest given stake both grey level 1 items while everything else I'm finding is level 5 with no stakes so gotta keep one to swap to to kill vamps.

The story is a lot of you need to read and actaully look around which is diffrent from this studios other titles but it still gives you enough to wonder, question and keep you going for another feeling of downing a vamp with your own talents and the powers you have worked hard for.

This game is a big disappointment, especially coming from my favorite game studio of all time. Knowing Arkane, I came into Redfall expecting a decent attempt at creating an immersive sim experience in a small open world map--a distinct atmosphere and mood, memorable characters and dialogue, lots of different types of interactions with the environment, environmental storytelling, and lots of nooks and crannies to explore and discover.

I got...none of that.

The world and characters are lifeless. There are ways to make even a modern setting ooze atmosphere, especially if it's a small coastal town overrun by vampires, and random blood splatters and poisonous red clouds obstructing my path aren't it. The vampire nests are cool, and so was the dollhouse mission--why isn't there more of that in the open world? Why do I have to specifically accept missions from safehouses to find NPCs and defeat certain enemies instead of just encountering them organically in the world? Why do all the NPCs in the fire station hub just say ""Hmmm"" or cough every time I try to talk to them? Why do the playable characters cycle through the same 3 sets of lines when one of them uses an ability? Why do the common enemies act like mindless zombies instead of real people with emotions and desires? Why aren't audio logs a source of lore in a co-op game where people tend to not wait around for you to read notes and books every 5 minutes? 

The combat is also bland. Enemy encounters are few and far in between, and not much thought has been put into their placements--they're just wherever, hanging out, not really interacting with the environment. The AI also sucks--multiple times I would have enemies stand completely still or shooting at the sky while I unload clips into them, or be unable to hit me because I'm slowly walking backwards. There is no room for creative kills like in every other modern Arkane game because the playable characters have tiny kits designed to work alongside the others, which sucks if you're playing solo or even duo. There is also no incentive for stealth since the ""hardest"" difficulty of the game is still laughably easy thanks to the shitty enemy AI.

There are also numerous other bugs plaguing the game--UI elements not displaying correctly, keybinds disabling themselves, items and notes unable to be interacted with if another player touches them first.

I don't think the game is as bad as most of the reviews are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, the game does needs a lot of work. The best way I can describe this game is its like Outbreak from Call of Duty Cold War. A semi open world where you gun down enemies and grab all the loot you can. The missions and side quests are pretty rinse and repeat - basically kill everything and grab everything you can. The map doesn't seem very large. There's quick travel points you unlock by opening safe houses. And, the main hub (so to speak) is a fire station that you rescue at the very beginning. Beyond that the world seems very empty and bland. There's a skill tree of upgrades for your character, which seems tailored to the character you select at the start of the game - pretty standard upgrade system, nothing new or special. Tons of weapons to find which have the typical damage progression based on rarity/class/special color. Those weapons however seem very bland as well. Shooting the weapons is boring, there's no character to any of the weapons. What I mean is it feels like you aren't shooting a ""real"" gun, as there is no kick or any simulated realness to the guns. They behave like a child's toy. All the enemies are pretty much rinse and repeat - as is the loot you find. This game isn't worth the $69.99 price tag in it's current state.

Apparently a 4080 isn't good enough to run the game maxed out and will subsequently run out of VRAM after 15minutes and crash your entire operating system in the process, and since the game doesnt save you're pretty much rolled back to the womb and have to learn to walk again, go to pre-school, etc, before catching up to the progress you lost.

Streamed it on twitch 02/05/23 showing at the same time my FPS in-game at all time (steam overlay).
It was optimised for me all the time with my config :

* 4K rez + Ultra (EPIC) settings + DLSS Quality + NO motion blur + NO HDR + NVIDIA Reflex activated *
- CPU : AMD Ryzen 7 7700x
- Mobo : ASUS TUF Gaming X670e-Plus
- GPU : NVIDIA RTX 4090
- Ram : DDR5 32Go 6000 MHz cl32
- WATERCOOLING : NZXT Kraken Z63

PC config doesn't do it all, there are game settings that help, but ALSO your settings in your BIOS, in Windows (updates, drivers...)...
All I'm saying is it worked perfectly for ME during MY 6 hours of gameplay, good amount of FPS considering I'm playing with 4k rez and high settings stream. *Just before starting the game, I did NVIDIA's update freshly released for this game.* 
It was the same for me at Cyberpunk's launch : I had zero bugs with my old gtx 1080 config + stream, whilst everyone else had a disastrous experience.

I hope OTHER players will be able to play soon just as well as I did yesterday. I feel very lucky.

PROS :
- Lots to loot.
- Fun with friend (I don't mind playing solo).
- Good looking graphics.
- Lootable skins.
- Vampires and not zombies for once ! :D
- Easy for non pro FPS/Shooter players.
- Good system of skills with different characters.

CONS :
- I am a left handed keyboard player and I unfortunately could not rebind/use correctly the character's mouvements to the ARROW Keys (at least not the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW), forcing me to use ZQSD/WASD which was really hard for me. (I didn't find any config.ini file to modify keybinds internally).
This is FPS, I'm not gonna play with a controller...
- You cannot change scope/AIM sensitivity regardless the normal mouse sensitivity. What I mean is if you set mouse sensi high, your scope/aiming will be high too.
- Torch/Light/Lamp is way too lit/high/strong !! You get a headache with time. It definitely needs to be less luminous.

Redfall,1294810,137705436,"This is a negative review but labeled positive in support for the Arkane Austin staff, I am also going to give this game a second chance in support. 

I've rewritten this review 3 times, my first about 2 days after game release, positive, I actually genuinely enjoyed my first few hours of my experience in Redfall, but admittedly, it was largely because I like the art style and I love are dearly departed Arkane Austin. Then when I quickly fell out of love and received a ""jester"" because liking the game made me a clown, but at that time I had already began quickly seeing the massive flaws. A game that could of been great, I actually believe that, call it cope, but with time and care, I liked this setting and I really think with smart AI and more content, an offline mode, this could of been special. However, it was a beautiful looking train wreck.

If you have ever played an Arkane game, you know the cut-scenes and layered lore is the absolute best in class, but this game betrayed that. From all their intricate and fascinating animated cut-scenes, we received nothing of the sort. I remember how great the looking glass stuff was in Prey, but no, this game got weird slideshow cardiovascular ghosts and important chapter openings were not much better with characters moved in slideshow. The beginning of this games opening animated and hand drawn slide show of happenings was beautiful, fascinating and pulled me in, and if the rest of the game copied its style in slides, it would of been magical, but it did not.

Not only did the lack of animation for story negatively effect my experience, but also the side quests. I actually liked the safe house to gather quests business, but the lack of side quests, and things I'd call environmental quests was a real let down. There are close to no, if maybe actually no side quests that you just find in the ""wild"" of Redfall. No survivors hunkered down in houses hiding from zealots and vampires, lots of lore indicating they exist and also, while matching the circumstance with its eeriness, the lack of animals at all, like crows, cats, dogs, etc makes the world boring. There are no allied resistance fighters on the streets, no scavengers creeping along to find food or supplies, just a lonely venture between quests, and not enough quests to keep playing.

There also comes a time in the middle of the game when you leave the first area for the second, but you cannot return to the area before. This is a mistake, it severely limited the playtime, story opportunities and hampered the looter shooter style that was happening. A lot of the best gameplay is in the first half of the game because the town was more interesting, more to do. even if it was a smaller area. 

In my opinion, controls were fine, gunplay was fine, the enemies were in fact braindead as many report but that was also untrue. For anyone who played Deathloop, these braindead AI are familiar. The beginning of the game they might as well be bottle fed toddlers with guns, but at later game(higher levels of character, not campaign), they become single shot killing machines, but both versions of them are still a bit slow in the head and can't seem to navigate. 

There is also a massive issue with how player character kits are made. Some are just better, I play Jacob when I play this, but his kit in my opinion is the absolute worst, especially in single player, the mode I play because I cannot get another soul to play multiplayer with me. He has excellent scouting abilities, cool, that means he must be great for solo right? No, invisibility and a crow reminisce of Bloodwing are alright, but every character has a mobility skill, he does not. His cool alt, basically useless late game, can't even kill most mid tier or high tier vampires with it at a certain point. Ghost sniper rifle is a cool idea but as a scout sniper that can't take high ground without sneaking through an enemy layer or requiring another player with a mobility skill to help, it sucks. Each character feels like they are missing a part of their kit, which yes, help with cooperative play, but as a single player capable game, it hurts the experience, gets rid of opportunities, becomes a headache often.

The world has an awesome art style in my opinion, this is an unpopular opinion I have discerned, I love it, but, and this is a big ""but,"" enemy designs, vampires in particular are repetitive, same 2 or 3 for the normals, and what I believe is 1 design for every other category of higher tier vampire. This is a short complaint but one that really bugs me.

Vampires are both way to weak and too powerful. I too often when I played this game would run into that health leech vamp, or the darkness one, and would get insta-killed because whoever designed the menaces, made them very bad for single, but yet in multiplayer, and or playing as anyone but Jacob, they die super easy sometimes. Rook vampire is in the same boat, having total aggro from them is a pain and often I have to take advantage of the AI stupidity and stand on a truck.

Recurring events with the dungeons/nests/hives are really cool, but I gave up on them really early, takes a lot of ammo, health, time and they spawn way too fast. They become an annoyance more than a fun activity eventually, actually very quickly, the rewards are okay, but not great and the repetitive structure is annoying too. Cool mechanic that needed heavy tweaking. 

Even after all my heavy criticisms I still hold the unpopular belief that this game with some good TLC, offline mode, some good work put in, that this game could be great, or at least better. I had misguided faith in the promise to fix this game and we are now in a place where it has been abandoned, promises have been broken, and a great studio destroyed. At the very least they should of at least kept to the commitment of offline mode, but they did not. Even if it was and is a waste of resources to fix and save this game, I am still disappointed that a promise is broken, I personally think that everyone should get a full refund and keep the game at this point. DRM should be removed, mod tools released, the whole 9 yards. Microsoft caused this game to be a failure, not Arkane, Microsoft is responsible, not Arkane, and Microsoft has destroyed great studios. Redfall was a failure, but Arkane Austin is already missed, bridges have been burned with Microsoft Games. With the possible future of adds on Windows, I hope that the Steam branch of Linux is sooner than later so that I may abandon Microsoft as much as one can in this info technology age. 

I have rambled too long now, I am bored on a Monday waiting on an appointment, I am tired and disappointed, bitter and perhaps even resentful. Goodbye Arkane Austin, your legacy was not this, it was Dishonored, it was Prey, even Deathloop even if I did not enjoy that one, Redfall is part of it all, but it should not be the only memory of something great. Thankyou for years of entertainment, my favorite games of all time and fond memories. Goodbye Arkane.",True,0,2155

[b]It's first Arkane game, which I don't enjoy and can't recommend.[/b] 
All, usually present, immersive sims elements aren't present (I know, it's not meant to be an immersive sim, but c'mon, can't throw a bottle to distract enemies, or take them silently from behind?) and, since it's Arkane game I was hoping to at least be able to kill enemies in some creative ways (Deathloop/Prey and Prey: Mooncrash? Not even mentioning Dishonored.).

I started the game as Dav (I forgot his full name). The guy who's a 'paranormal things reporter'. Anyway, in the starting sections I found some locked doors—some needed a lockpick, some needed a key, so I thought I'll explore the ship a bit. 
Found some meaningless notes scattered on the ground. Also, [i]ino 0451 safe/container found[/i], and believe me, I searched pretty thoroughly, both the ship, and both ways to the first quest mark where you get back to Redfall.

[h1]Performance, optimization and general eye candy stuff.[/h1]

The game has those micro-stutters every now and then, but I thought it's Unreal Engine loading shaders. I've got RTX 3080, Ryzen 9 5900x, 32GBs of RAM, and M.2 NVMe SSD, so the game started in 4k, with Epic settings loadout. I toned it down a bit, because those stutters were annoying. Reduced the resolution to 1080p and to High settings, with some DLSS on. The stutters were still present. BTW even on Epic the graphics wasn't epic in any way honestly. I think, it looks worse that Deathloop on similar settings. [u]And Deathloop runs much smoother.[/u]

[h1]The price tag.[/h1]

The price for the base game is some kind of late April's Fools joke.
Also, not mentioning the Deluxe edition price. I could spend that money on a food for a month, or a bootle of some really good whisky.

Usually, I don't write this kind of reviews. I expected more from Arkane. I know it's probably Bethesda pressure to release the game, though I might be wrong here and Arkane Austin just tried to [i]bite[/i] more than they can chew and they spit it out releasing this mess of a game.

Redfall,1294810,137705242,"Arkane Studios has (had) a carte blanche from me since I played Dishonored 1. Dishonored 2 is in my Top 10 most played games of all time. I liked Prey and defended Deathloop no matter how much the latter was flamed. So after playing for as long as possible (just below the magical 2 hour mark) my sad conclusion is:

[b]Redfall is overpriced and not very good. It's basically Phasmaphobia with guns and cookie-cutter AI. There's no real passion or effort here. There aren't even animated cutscenes.[/b]

The animations, sound and feel of the guns remind me of a mid-2000s game. The visual design might be interesting but the weapons feel like toys. The human enemies are brain dead, with stormtrooper-level aim and non-existent tactics. The vampires, who were meant to be a real menace, aren't any better. They simply charge at you like a maniac and mainly differ from the humans in that they require a button prompt to be finally eliminated. This could have been a great opportunity to mix the combat up by making the vampires immune to some weapons and vulnerable to others, but no. Just pick any ol' rifle, keep shooting until they start glowing red and Bob's yer uncle. I unknowingly defeated a boss vampire by myself with tier 1 weapons without much issue, so there's that. There are no stealth kills BTW, but it's not like you'd need them anyway.

There might be story in there somewhere but it felt like I missed a bunch of cutscenes because I had a hard time keeping track of who each character is, what his/her motivations are and why my character even bothers to interact with them. The game just starts throwing people at you, forces you to talk to each of them in a very specific and precise order (!!!) and sends you on your way to retrieve stuff and ""liberate safe houses"". I never met anybody non-hostile outside of these houses so I never understood what the point of them is story-wise. It's not like any survivors started moving in after I cleared them either.

Overall, there's not a crumble of the Arkane magic of past games in Redfall. Despite playing less than 2 hours, I feel like I've already seen it all.

I didn't do a $1 GamePass deal because I wanted to ""support Arkane"". 

I pre-ordered the Bite Back edition of this game via a third party key reseller so I could save AUS$25 off the AUS$165 recommended retail price, which unfortunately means I've waived my rights to a refund, while also incentivising predatory pricing behaviours. I won't be making that mistake again.  

I'll be continuing to play the game as I am currently undertaking university studies in game development, and this game makes for an interesting case study in the failures of modern AAA game development, like, who's fault is this game? Microsoft? Bethesda? Arkane? ""The Player""?

For those of you reading this who are not Arkane fanboys or aspiring game developers, the game in its' current state is not something most people would want to play even if it was free.

aiming is awful, no pinging, no ads toggle

lazy cinematics

PROS:
you can play as a strong black independent character or confident diverse pro social media  character. It is hard to find games that give priority to these elements nowadays. 

coop is good

you can choose how to progress based on your game play

looting and finding stuff is fun

edit 1:
- you cannot invite game from steam, you need to use in-game friend find which is not user friendly, you cannot search for name easily and go through the list to pick one.

-when you try to launch the game after invite, it somehow says connection lost or something and stuck on launching, then you have only two option press esc, quit to desktop or cancel. There is no quit to main menu

edit 2
- you cannot see your friends flash light (not the one you put your stick inside) so do not try to ping with spamming t

- if you and your friend tries to open a chest together - game crashes - do not

edit 3:

- AI is awful, you rescue civilians, they run away run past the stupid npcs and those poor budget AI s just watch them leave

- during some cinema quest, you can spam E and grab quest items without understanding you need them, this is really poor driven

- cinema full of AIs and you just start a fim, and they just wait there. Oh and by meaning fim, it is again lazy budget powerpoint slide show. WHO approved powerpoint slide show cinematics for AAA game in 2023?

- there are bulletproof curtains in game

- if you shoot at dead citizen body it gives effect of concrete

[b]Vampire[/b] is a great theme for this game, very appropriate for the very apparent [b]rush to market[/b] for Bethesda (along with with other triple-A sh*tshows this year). 

[h1]List of Problems: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Very clearly unoptimized. What the hell is going on here with the technical side of this game? Gone on the cheap? No help available from Epic, Nvidia or AMD?
    [*]Studdering, artifacts, shader compling prompt when it is not happening (thanks for wasting our time).
    [*]Ghost vampires you cannot kill.
    [*]Clipping issues for enemies and your character.
    [*]The gameplay is bland and generic. You've played it before in every Arkane game... nothing new here.
    [*]Game design... where to start. It was clear every recent game this pulls from or mimics, many of which are old formulas, been done, filler, or just phoned it in. Explore, loot, explore, loot.... disposable areas, keep moving, nothing memorable to see here or meaningful to return to.
    [*]Whats with the concept art movies and still shot stories? More phoning it in, rushed work?
    [*]One trick pony enemies. No depth and when it does start to escalate, using gimmicks (shields? really?). Braindead human enemies and vamps that jump around you and claw 'near' you while clearly losing focus on you.
[/list]

This is just a handful of hours into singleplayer. 

Now, that all said there is [b]some[/b] good here and lots of potential.

[h1]List of what they got right: [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Art direction. Congrats to the artists and level designers on creating a convincing environment (minus the glitches and technical issues). Seems like the team studied Cedric Peyravernay and Sergey Kolesov's work to generate an evolution of what we'd expect from Arkane. It is submersive and delivers.
    [*]Audio. Creepy goodness, although off at times for placement. 
    [*]Animation. Convincing and well done.
    [*]Story elements are good and start to hook.
[/list]

[h1]Summary: [/h1]

[u] Like most celebrities that are over-sold to only crash and burn, [b]needs rehab badly[/b].[/u]

There is some potential and great immersion (when not glitching, studdering or having technical issues). 

BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE A GREAT GAME. I REPEAT... SHINY IDEAS DO NOT MAKE A GAME. [b]Execution and delivery on those ideas do.[/b] This is not the game I was told it was and what I was sold for $100, Arkane Austin and Bethesda. FIX IT. Make good on your promises like CD Project and Hello Games did. Prove everyone wrong. Handle your sh*t. I will gladly come back and modify my review to be positive. 

If not, this will be a sad parting of ways since I was a huge fan of Arkane (along with MachineGames). If I can't trust your brands, will stop buying them....

But this is effectively a Early Access state for $70-$100.... which really is a big FU to us customers from the leaders at Arkane Austin and Bethesda.

For any system performance proclamations:
[i]ACER Predator Orion 7000 = i7-12700K, WIN 11 64bit, 32GB RAM, Geforce 3080 RTX, Samsung SSD 860 2TB, latest Nvidia drivers.[/i]

[hr][/hr]

[h1]UPDATE: After Completing the Game On Regular Mode At 39 Hours...[/h1]

The recipe is apparent, add to blender: equal parts Left4Dead, Borderlands, State of Decay, Far Cry, Dying Light, Generation Zero, Resident Evil, some Max Payne and Stranger Things story (the most obvious core being Salem's Lot) plucking with Fortnite Characters and obliviate on high. This emulates many of your favorite co-op games, some it straight up copies and yet misses entirely and fails. Anything less that 15-20 hours is not going to be an accurate assessment of the game, so good luck getting a refund after 2 hours. 

If you are an explorer and story person, this is going to be a long and painful ride down a slide of barbed wire and rubbing alcohol... I spent 29 more hours doing my damnedest to take in everything. The storyboard or pitch art theme is ugly, still comes across lazy; as do the nervous system ghosts in echos. Was that a money saver on animation and further art? Just recycled the concept work?

[b]4GB hotfix release?[/b] 3 things fixed... what are you slipping me the next DLC? Nothing in the release notes justifies a huge update. I saw no changes this week with 10 more hours of playing with it.

I was going to add 30 other problems/discoveries, but it doesn't fit and after seeing the drama coming to light at the associated companies, I doubt it matters. So I will wrap with my summary.

[h1]Overall Summary: This thing really is a mess. So [b]disappointed[/b], especially with the potential and Arkane's DNA.[/h1]

-Did the Devs accidentally launch an Alpha on live servers? 
-There is no way that this game is ready for launch, or worth 70 euro. It is EXTREMELY lazy. Did a junior dev click the wrong button and put the sandbox build on live servers?

Experience after 10+ hours:
-----------------------------------
-Same 10 weapons
-Is this a loot shooter, where is the loot?
-Duplicate models used everywhere, same vampires, same enemies
-What the hell is the story with healing and revive animations? Are they meant to be there? They show up for like 2 seconds every few hours
-Not one cinematic that is not a Powerpoint presentation
-Story telling through echos so that costs can be saved on animation
-Where are those cool cinematics that were created prior to game launch????
-Lag spikes randomly and texture/level of detail popping IS INSANE
-AI is even worse than I originally experienced
-Class balance.... don't get me started
-Are the devs even going to give us ANY news/feedback/fixes/changes/apology or did they all go on leave after launching the game?

Experience after 2 hours:
-----------------------------------
I went in positive, really looking forward to this game for a long time to play with my bro, sadly, despite all of the bad reviews, I tried it and I am left feeling like I was ripped off. I dislike fueling any negative hype trains, however there are way to many to mention poor or lazy game design choices which are already mentioned in multiple reviews. The game is just empty and uninspired. The gameplay and AI is just the biggest let down since cyberpunk. Enemies are so incredibly stupid and offer no challenge, even on higher difficulty, the pathing and AI awareness is beyond stupid. The world feels empty and just dead due to the lack of any real AI pathing or interesting encounters. In a sense it reminds me of the division before the bounty system where there is an awesome open world that is just dead. I would expect to feel threatened and challenged in a world overrun with vamps.

Watching some videos now the devs speak about:
-The complexities of the character skills and synergies
Reality: Characters are cool, the dialogue is funny, but the skills are meh, very boring skill trees and skill effects are very poor, synergies are dull.
-Different ways in which the player can approach missions
Reality:AI is to dumb to know if you are stealthing or shooting them, or literally standing in front of them
-The cool combat and immersive world
Reality: There are long gaps in combat between areas that leave the experience boring and dead. The gunplay is really sub-par

The advertisement is basically all bs, the game is not ready for launch, the amount of pop in from objects in the environment is immersion breaking, but the AI is just so stupid it completely breaks the experience.

I'm kinda sad about this one. It had potential. A vampire story by Arkane?, I was all in.
Unfortunately, the multiplayer element is way too strong on this one just to be able to actually enjoy it as a single player game as advertised by the publisher.

Most of the stuff you might expect from Arkane is there, multiple entrances to an objective, locks to pick, lore. But it all feels off.
Everything has been simplified in name of multiplayer just to keep things going constantly, which ends up feeling uninspired for a single player experience.
Even the movement feels off (sprinting is just straight up broken).
Cinematics have been reduced to a bunch of still images with some narration over them.
It also suffers from some horrible performance issues on pc, even when meeting the maximum requiriments.
Most likely will be revised in the upcoming updates since most of Arkane games released with poor performance on pc, so hopefully people who enjoy the game will get their moneys worth.

[i]TL;DR[/i]
I soooo wanted to love this game, the trailers, the hype, the previews all looked amazing but in it's current state I'm struggling to recommend anyone who has this on XBox Game pass let alone pay £60/$70 for it.

I put in a few hours (approx. 12hrs at time of writting this) in the hope that it would somehow change my mind but sadily it's just not ready. Improvements required so far are centered around AI/Performance/Co-op/Graphics so pretty much the core of the game ... not sure how long it will take to sort this out but my fingers shall remain crossed.

[i]Starting with the positives:[/i]
[list]
[*] It's a [b]lot of fun[/b] running around looking for trouble and shiny new weapons when solo but once co-op was working it was so much more fun ... YOLO!!!
[*] [b]Performance[/b] was okay but I am running a 4090 (IKR) @ 3440x1440 with the occasional stutter didn't impede the play through to much
[*] Skills are fantastic and so much fun, especially when combined with skills from other players in co-op
[*] Weapons are great with some decent looks and mahooosive damage (eventually)
[*] The map and ability to jump around is pretty good, especially as you can port when out in the middle no where with no ammo and instantly fill ya boots...
[*] Character customisation and outfits is pretty good and offers enough flexibility (once you unlock stuff) to provide that unique vampire hunter look you want
[*] Co-op on steam with steam friends only is pretty easy to get going
[*] The menu system is pretty intuitive [i](grasping now)[/i]
[*] Short enough missions without the whole go here and fetch, then go there and fetch then go here and find x but instead go here and kill, go there and kill :D [i](grasping again)[/i]
[*] 12hrs with 2 deaths [i](yeah I'm gonna stop grasping now)[/i]
[/list]


[i]Now for the negatives ....[/i]
[list]
[*] £60/$70 for a clearly unfinished game :'(
[*] Visually it's ""okay"", not stunning but okay
[*] The level of clipping/dsync etc. in this game is just plain annoying as hell... when vamps get stuck in a wall and you can't stake them fine but when a boss does it and you can't get the skull/loot then it's just infuriating
[*] AI is just predictable ... boom headshot ... wait 1 second ... boom headshot as the next NPC walks into your sight and repeat for X
[*] AI is pretty sparse, the world feels a bit too empty even given the storyline being portrayed
[*] Abundance of food/drink but no idea if it does anything or not
[*] There are 1 or 2 really nice textures in the game but overall it generally feels pretty dated when wandering around the open world, most of the detail has been put into the restricted number of buildings that you can enter
[*] Crossplay co-op is janking as hell and didn't work between steam and xbox on PC
[*] Co-Op cannot be started if you're in a game and additional players can only be added by returning to the main menu/lobby and re-inviting everyone again ... plenty of scope here for improvement
[*] [spoiler]The nest heart areas feel like they should be mini dungeons/raids to be carried out with a group of 4 but soloing these is about the only challenge there is in the game[/spoiler]

Redfall,1294810,137702760,"Coming from a Bethesda fanboy:

Would've been a good game for a $39.99 price tag. With $70 AA/AAA games becoming the new standard, studios should be doing their best to justify this already hard to swallow pill, but this game is definitely not worth $70 in my opinion.

- The environment is genuinely cool looking. The colors, style, and overall look of the town of redfall feel good to walk around during the day or during the night. A lot of the houses can be entered and there's plenty of clutter to make them feel lived in, and like the inhabitants really did leave on the spot to evacuate the city. 

- The concept is unique and has a lot of potential if the gameplay is tweaked (tweaked might be an understatement) a lot. Is this a contender for a competitor to Destiny 2 or borderlands? Absolutely not. But it could've been.

- Gameplay is okay. As others have said, the AI is pretty bad (I'm playing the game on the hardest mode available in the first playthrough). Not so bad that you're shooting at target dummies, but not far enough away from that than is acceptable. It's still worth it to approach big gun fights with some tactics like setting up abilities, sending in your ""tank"" friend first, sniping from distance, dedicating someone to deal with the vampires, etc. but the fact that you can run in with a shotgun and mindlessly blast away to deal with most confrontations makes it feel like there should definitely be some smarter AI. Especially from a reputable game studio and a reputable publisher. There also needs to be a lot more diversity in enemies. There's only two factions (the corporate mercs and the cultists) with the only discernible difference being cultists have vampires with them and the mercs have turrets. Other than that, it's basically copy/paste of the same soldier unit but with different guns. It gets old quick having only these enemies to shoot at. The vampire dens were also a missed target in my opinion. They're a little enjoyable, but they should've been a huge staple of vampire shoot-em-up loot heavy events.

- The character options and abilities are a little limited, but still unique and fun for the most part. This game avoids just giving everyone nuke abilities in favor of more utility based abilities which I appreciate. The characters are each unique and have their own narration and backstories woven into the storyline of the game which is a good move. The skill trees feel very limited and need to be expanded in my opinion, along with having a few non character exclusive trees for different gun styles and play styles. 

- The loot system is okay. GOOD loot is found often enough to keep me engaged and make me feel rewarded for activities, but sparse enough that it still is exciting to get a gold tier weapon whenever I find one. The weapon diversity is well done in my opinion as well. There's plenty of options in most of the gun styles (vampire specific weapons like the UV light and stake launcher are super limited though) with the cool and fun design of the guns being their strongest suit. The gold tier weapons do need unique abilities or mechanics though, there's not quite enough to make them feel like they shouldn't just be slightly stronger purple tier weapons.

- Questing in this game needs work. Finding hideouts and doing the hideout missions is pretty fun. Most everything else feels kind of generic in my opinion. It's also kind of hard to be invested in the quests when the story is told in slideshow format and it's not very theatrical doing it that way. I've already forgotten most of the story and I genuinely try to pay attention. The NPCs you do quests for are also super forgettable and lacking character. They need to re-do the NPCs and exposition of this game entirely.

- The map size seems really small. I'm only a few hours in and I've already covered half the map.. And not to say that the map size should be the only factor, but the lack of fun and rewarding random events/global events/etc. means that once you clear an area then you've exhausted the game play for that area apart from going and killing the respawning enemies repeatedly. 

All in all, not as bad a game as a lot of people are saying, but still well below the bar of what I was expecting from both Arkane and BGS. So much potential since the premise of the game is genuinely new, creative, and unique. Maybe with a few more months of content additions, bug fixing, and feature tweaking I can come back and change my review to recommended is what I hope.",False,7,663

The trailers had more story than any of the slideshow moments in the game.
Within the first hour of playing the game, I had my doubts if I can recommend it or not as a single player game.
I am highly disappointed in this purchase, especially for a $70 game I prepurchased. (never again unless early access)

What I experienced on 3 hrs into the game to give it a fair review:
-open world with broken AI and no difficulty on ""standard"" dusk difficulty (I'm not hardcore, but standard is not optimal)
-world with no soul - no feeling of wanting to explore the environment (which is usually my favorite thing to do)
-beautiful environment art ruined by poor graphic optimization on a 30 series card
-below par story and no immersion from the few npcs that are present (they just stand there and don't do much else, except exist, like in a early access games)

Since I spent the money, I probably will play it a bit more, but I think this is fundamentally just not a solid game, but rather an underwhelming game all around and won't change my mind even if they fix the optimization issues. The game is lackluster and undead like the vamps and ""hollow"" men. 

Buy Redfall at your own risk. Hope this review helps you get a better idea of what you are purchasing before buying.

We only played 2.5 hours with my two friends because one of the main campaigne is buggued and we cannot progress.
We went into this with an open mind, but all of us with 30 years of gaming behind us, so we're not some incel blue-balled unhappy in their mother's basement.

To get to the gist of it:
Redfall is not a good game. And this is not because of a game-breaking bug that prevent you from going forward. It is not a good game because it is bad and/or mediocre on all of the aspects that should make it enjoyable.

-The gunplay is horrendous. You will simply pick whatever gun do the most damage and frankly, there are not much difference between most of them. The gun which does the most damage will simply be the best. And some guns (handguns for example) dmg output is so terrible that you can stick with a shotgun 4 levels unders and it will still be 10 times better.
There is no complexity to the gunplay, you just shoot and jump around like you are in Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, and spam your abilities. Guns have no ""weight"", you just spam click.
Ammos is never an issue, unless you forget to loot the ammo box available in every streets/houses around.
The stealth option is laughable since by the time you stealth behind  a monster, you can have shot them down 10 times and went 200 meter further ahead.

-The difficulty is non-existent. We chose the hardest difficulty available at the start (3 out of 4) and at lvl 4, our mates completely soloed a miniboss mission while running around like a racoon on cocaine, while the 2 others were looting random stuff in the basement of a building.
You need to fall from a high rise to start taking fall dmg, and the IA is dumber than a rock.

-The AI is one of the worst. Monsters are dumb, forget you as soon as you're out of sight for a SECOND (Yes, a second), or they get stuck and stop moving just being hit by bullet doing nothing.

-The gameplay loop is terrible because 30 mins after starting you will be full of money, of medikits, of every lockpick/rewire items, and then you will salvage everything (manually one by one, of course) in your inventory, except the best guns you can find, which will not be often, even though you will find 10 guns per houses. And you will realize that you spent more time looking for items in houses than killing monsters.

-The story is not compelling because the atmosphere is frankly horrible. How can you be scared when you are literally  rolling over everything on sight? You're supposed to be scared, but you cannot.Which leads me to my next point....

-Redfall city is dead because even the deads are not there. Enemis cannot be seen for half a kilometer, then you enter  amission point, there are 3 vampires, then further 3 cultists, then further 2 vampires, then nothing for 5 to 10 minutes. 

All of that leads me to a single conclusion:
Redfall is not a labor of love. This is not a good game. This is a game which was released at the very least 1 to 2 years earlier than it should have, and probably because they wanted to sell the hell out of it as a Game as a Service and sell DLCs. The game systems are not good. This is not polished, this game was released 2 years earlier, and thus is probably going to be a stillborn. If you do buy it, make sure you play less than 2 hours and make yourself an idea of it quick, because this is not the type of game we as players want to encourage publishers to release in such a state.

World: A big empty world. More walking then fighting most of the time. Even if you do come across enemies the AI is so poor that more often than not your can just run through them. Even if they start firing they have the accuracy of a storm trooper so you shouldn't have any problems.

AI: Wow.... Just wow, I don't think this was sent through QA if it was then they need to fire the whole team b/c i don't understand how you could overlook this glaring issue. I have had vampires (Super loud angsty vamps that you don't have to see to know they are around) just not move at all on approach. If i spun around them I could keep the question mark above their head and by the time they reacted they where dead. 

Difficulty: I enjoy a challenge. I play a lot of games now adays on the hard difficulty setting. With that being said this hardest unlocked difficulty setting they offers is amazingly easy. I moved it down to normal thinking that maybe i had set it to an easier setting but nope. Honestly did not feel like the difficulty even changed.

Graphics: It really should look better then this. The tree leaves really bothered me since they looked very low res. Lots of pop-in, strange renders and my character looked as though he was run through a beauty filter. Stuttering/ Frame drops.... just so much and it was not even using that much CPU or GPU utilization.

Cost: 70$.... for this much a game should release in a better state (like actually working and complete). I wish I had an answer on how we as gamers could fix this issue but there isn't one that you could get everyone on board with.  

Gunplay: I did not mind this as much as everyone else. I am not a super picky or hard to please person so I was happy with it. Although! enemies died way to quickly.

This game isn't what I'd expect from Arkane, I gave it a college try but alas, here we are.


Hi! Don't hate me,

Honestly, this game is really dang fun! Not played it for too long yet mark you, but the progression feels great and the gunplay (other than the lack of an ADS sensitivity slider which is OUCH) is pretty good!

Graphics are more than passable, beautiful at times, and the vampire AI is fun and engaging. The story just picked up in a really interesting way too that makes me wanna play more so YEAH!

FPS, solid 120, 1440p but I am on a 4090 and i9 13900k so I'm pretty sure I could run Nasa's space programs with that. 

Few cons though which drag it down, human AI is more A than I, (vamps make up for that thankfully but still bad), lack of ads sensitivity slider, lack of real threat in the overworld (something like dying light 1's nighttime fear would be amazing), enemies respawning immediately after dying, Weapon scaling is a bit weird? A golden level 4 rifle being worse than a plain old normal level 5 one is a bit wack to be fair. 

Other than that, I had a lot of fun, I'm looking forward to playing more, it's a fun game. It hasn't broken any barriers, it hasn't progressed the field, but it's FUN. Games don't need to break barriers. They just need to do what we want them to. Which is pass the time in a fun way.

This game has all the bones of a game that could be awesome, but these bones just aren't connected in any logical way. you can sneak, but being sneaky doesn't benefit you--every weapon is a gun and every nearby enemy gets alerted the second you shoot. the enemy AI is bad, it feels several generations behind.  The idea of vampire strongholds is great, they just don't affect the environment or enemies around them enough to feel different from anything else.
The classes don't distinguish themselves from each other enough to make the choice meaningful. The best tactic for everything is shoot enemies in the head as quickly as possible. There's no tangible benefit for any class being close or far away, there's no reason to apply any tactics as a group.

Bugs!
It seems enemies don't spawn properly. Scopes and reticles don't load properly, sliding gets you stuck in the ground. enemies get stuck in walls. This game needed a serious playtest before launch.

Critical strikes are too strong, with head shots on a 150 damage weapon doing 1500 damage. This might be a great thing if there was enough enemy diversity that finding the critical spot was a core mechanic, but as it sits, it's shoot everything in the head or they're bullet sponges.

The game runs great with occasional glitches and will only get better as the DEVS start fixing and optimizing.
The gameplay is a little clunky, but again, will get better as DEVS start fixing things.

Redfall,1294810,137698558,"I cannot recommend the game at the moment. That may change in the future, but right now? No. There are pros and cons, however the cons far outweigh the pros and honestly if you're reading a review you want to know what the game will be like so here we go.

Played with friends last night for around 5 hours for day 1. 

1. The bottleneck: I had to re-download and patch the ENTIRE game even though I did the preinstall. This got bottlenecked and took 3 hours... for a game I already had downloaded. This was a bad start. 

2. The boots: During our playtime we had several disconnects, and when one person disconnected it started a chain event that eventually just shut the entire lobby down. This disconnect cost a few of us skins we'd collected, and other progression.

3. Glitches: We ran into a number of them, but I personally ran into a few that were just... breaking. One; I'm playing Jacob I get a cool sniper.. only problem is I can't aim with the sniper because when I do it shows the scoped 'aim fov' but the scope is blinking in and out of existence and I can still see my rifle and in my hand like I wasn't aimed in. This makes it impossible to see because the scope is actually in the way of seeing anything on the screen in front of me. Oh, and when aiming with my other weapons.. I have a scope outline on my screen and they lose their natural crosshair. Fun times. Then another time I'm sliding down a hall way in a Nest and get stuck. Hard stuck. We tried killing me, we tried me staking a vamp, we tried the elevator spell, we even finished the nest and teleported me out of the nest and I was still stuck in the overworld. Sure, it was funny, but oh so annoying specially when I had to exit and it triggered one of the crashes mentioned above.

4. OH GOD THE PIXELS: I'm running this on epic, and when you tag an enemy, specially vampires, they get a red outline and this outline makes them look like they're something from Doom, not the remake, the original. It's horrible.

5. The AI: It's clunky as others have said. Don't think I need to go too in depth on this as it's more of something many people have said.

6. Graphics: Beyond pixelation of enemies when tagged some things just pixelate. Floor boards seem to love to do it, where there are just little black dots around where the game seems to think shadows should be. IDK. It doesn't look good.

7. Skins: Hey guys we can customise our characters! Cept... not so much. If you want to wear any part of your iconic skin, well you can't change any other part. So if you're Jacob and you want to keep the hood but wear a different body combo? Get bent. No such luck.

8. World Design: While the world is 'okay' it's empty and kind of bland. This is not what I expected from Arkane at all, not enough funny ways to do things, not enough diversity in play style. Sure there are multiple ways to do things, but usually it just ends in a straight firefight so why bother doing things uniquely? There is no reward for being stealthy or intelligent in your moves i's just meh. Honestly they'd of been better off just having a hub and sending you on missions and generating those mission maps with unique takedowns and such in mind IMO.

9. Price tag and future updates: So, this is a big one for me and one of the reasons why I definitely cannot recommend the game right now. With everything up above this is NOT a 70 dollar game. This is a 20-30 dollar Early Access game at best and then on top of that they have a plan to make us buy new heroes in place to milk even more money out of this unfinished, unpolished.... thing.

Redfall,1294810,137698455,"let me start by saying yes this game has flaws but lets be honest what game doesn't but too see all these negative reviews because of the current nature of review booming and all following like sheep rather than formulating your own opinion its just sad too see.  iv seen reviews saying the game runs like crap...all i can say is try updating your drivers cos im running on a 2070 super on max settings and it runs like a dream so i dont think its a game issue its a you issue, dont get me wrong iv seen a few frame drops in the centre to the more concentrated town parts but nothing to cry about the game is still more than playable. iv seen people complaining about low quality textures all i can say is this game does exactly the same as most other game does and uses low quality textures in the distance and high quality when you get close, is seen one situation where the texture switch has slightly been delayed so the item in question looked a bit crappy for like less than a second but again thats nothing to cry about.  The one flaw that i do agree on is that the ai sometimes can be a little dumb but i must stress sometimes, the human ai does go for cover, it does try to flank you but only sometimes other times it will just stand there and let you use it as a bullet sponge.  Vamp ai is something similar sometimes they will charge at u like crazy dip duck and diving your shots other times the will just stand there looking up at the sky watching the pritty birdies its a combat roulette that needs to be fixed.
the last thing that i must comment on is the price current gaming trends is seeing AAA game pricing going through the roof and its something that needs to stop, as much as i like this game i can honestly say that its is not worth the asking price luckly i purchased it from outside of steam so go it cheaper but anyone paying the full price i could understand them being a little disappointed.",True,7,1354

Redfall,1294810,137698211,Absolutely one of the worst games ever made.,False,10,912
Redfall,1294810,137698091,"I was excited for this game. And now ive used it as a learning experience to wait for reviews. This game is a dissapointing mess, and honestly, i don't think any amount of updates could save it. This isn't just an undercooked game with a blatant lack of polish, this feels like a concept more than an actual game. All the pieces are in the game that couldve made it good, but it doesnt do ANY of them well. 

STORY:
The story is incoherent at best and non-existent at worst. The most part of a story you can actually get is through notes and collectibles. The main missions are literally ""go here, grab thing because we told you too, maybe kill a thing, and report back."" There are few exceptions, but those are found in boss fights. I haven't completed the game to see the rest, and honestly, i dont think I can push myself to complete it. I know the game itself is short. You can complete everything in 12 hours. And some things are brought into the game that just dont make sense. Theres a third type of enemy thats like a private security, and it is never TRULY explained what their purpose is. Like at all. They exist, JUST to exist. And they play the EXACT same way as the cultists. In the notes, there is a DECENT story. But it is never given proper showing. There arent even actual cutscenes in the game. Not one single, actual cutscene in this game. Just models frozen in settings while the characters monologue over them. 

GAMEPLAY:
Couldve been good. As i said, all the pieces are there, the just do NOT work. Its a generic shooter that doesnt reinvent any wheels. The loot system is NOT rewarding. You can find the highest tier gear with a 30% damage buff and use that for most of the game straight from the jump. The abilities are laughably bland. I found myself not using them, ever. And the skill tree is beyond pointless. It doesnt change things to cater to a playstyle, or do anything interesting. None of them do. Granted, i only played one character, but you only need to play one to see how little thought went into it. The AI is some of the worst ive seen in a AAA title. You kill an enemy right next to another one and half the time theyre not even aware of it. Constantly running into walls or standing in front of whatever theyre shooting only to get obliterated. 

As for the vampires, the main focus of the game, once youve fought one, its the exact same fight. Over, and over, and over. There are a few ""specials."" and by specials, i mean they do one thing differently, or just have more health. They basically just rush you. In groups, its a little challenging. But more annoying than it is engaging. The CORE element of their game, feels like a chore to deal with rather than a rewarding aspect. And most times you can just avoid them. Just run through everything. Its insane. 

I finished one boss fight, and it isnt even that good. Nothing rewarding about it. I have nothing to say on this end. It was just BORING. I imagine all boss fights feel the exact same. 

There is weapon variety, but it doesnt matter. All weapons feel the same. 

OPEN WORLD:
This is probably the worst out of all the things in this game. The open world is not only relatively small, it is EMPTY. Sure, enemies are fairly placed around, but when every fight feels the same, it doesnt matter. The loot system isnt rewarding enough to care after awhile. If you were expecting to try and search for specific chests that contain great loot, well i hate to tell you, that isnt the case. The ""looter shooter"" aspect of the game is as bare bones as it gets. There is nothing in this map. Aside from side missions, like ""vampire nests."" which are very short dungeons with maybe 5 enemies in it that are supposed to give you higher tier items, but again, when every weapon feels the exact same, it really doesnt mattter. No weapon has anything interesting going for it. Even the Highest tier weapons. They just look different. 

ATMOSPHERE:
This is probably the only thing the game does well in. Its creepy. The music is actually pretty good. The setting and set pieces feel like a stephen king novel. And the core of Arkane with enviornmental storytelling is definitely there. If this game took a direction that Arkane was naturally good at, it could have been a decent game, and it shows. 

MULTIPLAYER:
No matchmaking. Havent played with anyone but ive heard its constantly bugged. They advertised it as a 4 player co op and didnt even bother to cater to that. If you cant make it accessible and easy to play with others, then why do it?

PERFORMANCE:
AI, as I said, is atrocious. It doesnt make the game fun. You can steamroll through almost everything. 

Stuttering is not CONSTANT, but it is frequent. FPS drops in almost every area with multiple buildings or enemies. There is a significant lack of polish in this game. It actually makes me question if this product was actually rushed or they just gave up.

Textures take awhile to load in, graphic bugs are frequent. It just does not feel polished.

GRAPHICS:
Not terrible, but for a AAA in 2023, could be better. This studio has other games that came out YEARS ago that look better. Prey, and Dishonored 2 GENUINELY look better than this game. Not to say its terrible, but for those of you that care.
 

OVERALL:
Again, i really wanted to like this game. and I pushed myself to try and complete it before making this, but honestly, it came to a point where I was pushing myself so hard I wasnt having any amount of fun. The first mission feels decent. They tell you to play your way when finishing the first mission, but there is no REAL way to play. The lack of choice at all is masked by the ""open world"" aspect of the game. Arkane has made absolute BANGERS in the past, and i genuinely cant see how they thought this game was anywhere near ready to come out. Even if they patch it over time and fix things like the framerate, the AI, maybe difficulty scaling, change the perk system, that doesnt fix the main problem with this game. The game has no identity. It has a bunch of elements thrown into it to cater to as wide of an audience as possible and does none of them well. I truly dont believe Arkane is to blame. I think Microsoft made them create the game in the safest way possible, at the risk of the studio itself to make as much money as possible before people realize how unfinished this game is. Ill say it again and again, this game isnt a finished product, it feels more like a CONCEPT of a game.

Redfall,1294810,137697817,"As a casual gamer, I wanted to love this game, but I just can't. It's surprising to me that Arkane Studios, who brought us amazing games like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop, could make something like this. I had high hopes, but unfortunately, it feels like another rushed game that was banking on the love players have for the studio. It's similar to Cyberpunk 2077, which was also rushed and promised a lot but failed to deliver.

I'm hoping that over time, the developers will fix it, like they did with Cyberpunk 2077, and turn it around. It's not helping that it's available on Game Pass, as it feels like it's just adding to the list of unfinished games. The fact that Xbox bought this studio is a letdown, and I'm worried that Starfield will also be a disappointment. If it is, it could be the end of Xbox Game Pass and maybe even the console.

Here are some pros and cons:

Pros: The combat is safe but enjoyable, and it's fun to play with friends.

Cons: The graphics are terrible right now, the RPG elements could be better, the AI is lacking, it requires an always-online connection, the frame rate is poor, and the game is graphically unimpressive. The story doesn't have cutscenes, only story panels with moving pictures. There's no matchmaking, which is needed for socially awkward players. There aren't enough weapon types, and there aren't many open locations like buildings and houses. The town seems dead.

Overall, the game is just broken. It needed a delay of at least one or two years to live up to the $70 Arkane Studio Game Title. At best, it feels like a $30-40 game. I'm sorry for the long list of negatives, but there just isn't much positive to say about it at the moment.
pros are, combat is safe but fun, fun with friends, 

cons are, graphics at this time is trash, rpg elements could be better, AI Sucks, Always a online connection, Frame Rate and just Graphically not great rn, Story has no cutscenes just story panels with moving pictures, no matching which is needed for people that is socially awkward, weapon types needs to be more, not alot of open locations as in building and houses, town seems dead no pun

Redfall,1294810,137697705,"Redfall is more of a disappointing game than an actually bad game and your mileage may vary, but the question is ""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" Absolutely not. If you like Arkane games, don't buy this one. This is certainly not a $70 experience when Prey and Dishonored 2 look and play as good as they did 5+ years ago. 

Now, to be completely fair, I only played 3 hours of this game which isn't enough time to really criticize this game so harshly, but Redfall lacks polish and, in my opinion, the creative care and crafty storytelling nuance of previous Arkane titles. However, credit should be given where credit is due. 

This is a game you can play and there are things to do in it. You can join up with your friends pretty easily and start playing right away. However, there's no polish or direction. Things happen and you float around from objective to objective left-clicking or pressing E until next quest or start new quests via a board. I didn't make it far enough to know whether or not the gameplay gets more interesting, but the shooting doesn't feel great and seems like a step back from Deathloop or Prey. Movement is clunky when vaulting and sprinting feels like all the characters are on ice skates. There's also no climbing animation for characters when you observe them mantling and they'll just sort of A pose up an obstacle. Characters arms bend freakish ways when you're vaulting using an FOV over 90. The voice acting seems fine enough and the performances aren't the issue, but how can you make uninspired drivel sound good? 

Regarding the characters, all of their personalities are the worst. Each of the characters spout the most inane cringe inducing quips while also suffering from a strong case of diarrhea of the mouth. They never shut up. They always have something to say about everything. I'm just not sure who these characters were made for, but it definitely feels like a committee of execs who think ""the young people"" or ""the gen z millennials"" will identify with ""the telekinetic threat in student debt"" or the social media influencer ghost hunter. I can't say I've ever wanted to play a social media influencer character ever. But again, credit where credit is due, Arkane sure hit the nail on the head with how completely unlikable Devinder is as a character. The two other characters, the sniper and combat medic, have heinously insipid abilities and backstories. Jacob and Remi might as well have just been called sniper man and robot lady. Redfall doesn't spend any time getting you to care about these people or their problems and builds zero connection to each character unlike previous titles that built the bond between the player and the character over the length of the game like Alex Morgan, Corvo and Emily, or even Colt and Julianna. Every single character is forgettable. I only know their names because I looked them up. 

Redfall feels like a game that was pushed for release before it had been fully fleshed out. I'd be interested in hearing the experience of the devs and creatives that worked on Redfall because it seems like they pulled a bunch of themes, tropes, and archetypes out of a bag and threw them against the wall with a post it note that said ""B Horror, but not funny, interesting, or charming.""",False,9,197

Launch Day Review: 

I played with three friends, two of them via Steam and one via Crossplay on PC Gamepass. So far, we haven't had any major issues. We had fun playing together. The gameplay itself is enjoyable, and the variety of enemies is good, with some of the vampires being particularly creative. In tight spaces, technical problems can still make things challenging, and overall, the AI could be made a bit tougher (we're playing on the ""hard"" difficulty and finding it quite doable). Ammo and interactive objects could be highlighted better as well.

After few hours solo: (i changed it to thumps down)

Playing solo is not as enjoyable as playing with a group of three. Some main missions are poorly executed, to the extent that they would be considered side quests in other games.

Additionally, when playing solo, you quickly become overwhelmed by the constantly respawning vampires. There doesn't seem to be any way to revive yourself upon death. Moreover, there are further questionable decisions: There is never a true pause in the menu, so even if you want to look something up, you can still be attacked in the game world.

Its not fun to explore the world or use the Heores abilitys in a cool or creative way. I am hard disapointed. Missing the Spirti of Deathloop, Prey and Dishonored.",True,0,1788

Redfall,1294810,137697531,"I refunded the product, I only played for around 120mins on launch. Take this review with a grain of salt.

The game takes Fallout 76 and Borderlands gun play and mixes them together. At times, the sights are clunky and the gun doesn't seem to want to cooperate. Though, usually, the gun play is decent and when it works it does work well. However, the minor issues do tend to build up to a ruined experience such as a shotgun reload not happening if you sprint or climb on the last frame of the action. Small instances like this are frequent as stutters can affect gameplay, and the game stutters/slows frequently due to terrible optimization

The melee, too, is a part of this experience as when it works it makes things enjoyable. When it doesn't, it's frustrating at most and annoying in the least. There is no lunge which is fine. However, what is not fine, is that a leaf from a branch or twig obscuring that cultist's face can absorb your entire elbow's blow that would normally 1-tap the guy. Repeated melee strikes with your stake weapon to trigger the finishing blow on a vampire is also a must 9/10 times. Melee just breaks for no reason because you're not at the right distance.

Skills on characters are bland and limited in my opinion. Get ammo, get health, and follow the same upgrade path everyone else does. It's a game that wants to be borderlands with less character customization/build options. Nothing exciting in the skill tree section.

The map is like a Far Cry map, but smaller. Enemies are everywhere, but they're cultists or vampires. Or there's red mist blocking certain areas. The night-day cycle exists, but nothing really changes. Nothing different or exciting, this is just a Far Cry map with Far cry objectives. It just has vampires in it.

Overall, the game is a 5/10. Not worth $70, not exciting enough. So I uninstalled to get a refund. There's potential here, but ain't no one making use of it from my 2 hour's experience.

Sometimes things don't render in right leading me to shoot trees that look like bloated green vamps. (it’s an odd occurrence but happens frequently) I think more ammo is needed for some weapons (In excess of course) I picked up a revolver that chambers 6 rounds but could shoot 15… Which confused me but fine I guess.
I do enjoy the fighting! It can get pretty hard forcing me to take the fight in different angles or run away training the enemies which brings back fun memories from cod zombies. The customization for characters kind of sucks. Its either be a furry or not be one… Sometimes I just want to be a babe without massive arms. Regardless, the abilities are a good touch as well that brings about the skill tree. Love skill trees. I played the medic because I wanted the robo pup, solo play was 100% more pleasant until the robot pup froze and stopped moving. Had to reload the game a few times. 
Would not pay $70 dollars for something like this… There’s plenty of other games that provide more for less but before I really commit to this statement, I need to beat this game and run all the side missions… Hopefully they add more cosmetics and maybe give the black chick a hot vamp gf instead of a bf (Personal Bias XD)

Vampires, the main threat of the game, are disappointingly easy to kill and are not threatening whatsoever, just a little bit more bullet spongy than other enemies.

- Stuttering is hell, it took me three tries to actually get the game to start, even with a powerful machine. Frame rates drop when loading in areas as well. But it stabilizes after a few seconds
- Texture loading is slow, and sometimes resets even if staying in an area
- Optimization is pretty standard and basic for a character, but the powers are cool nontheless
- I feel like the aiming is a bit off... even when I'm aiming directly at them. But other wise, the shooting feels satisfying when they do hit.
- The world is empty, but not overtly massive in the beginning, and different enemies respawn if you exit a safehouse, so it's not like there's nothing to do in an area except shoot more guys
- Vampires are menacing, despite how easy they are to take down even on normal mode, they look creepy af and that's cool.

- The graphics and look of the game is good, i like the style, the lighting and shadows it all looks very good, Gun models are great and the look of the UI and inventory is well done.
- The audio is good, love the music, gun sounds and overall environment sounds.
- The gameplay is good it feels a bit like Far cry, Not bad
- The world is bland though, We where exploring and the houses we came across we cound even enter they where just for show, also only a few enemies here and there, it fellt empty.
- The performance of the game is decent, yes a few lag/stutters here and there but not to bad it was playable
I play this game on medium graphics with a i7 8700k, 3060TI, 16gb

Redfall,1294810,137695166,"Primary issue is optimization. Before you can get to talking about any gameplay and story problems, you have to address the fact that the game needs to be optimized and figure out how they can make gameplay smooth. Playing on a 3080, having to turn graphics down and reduce DLSS to ultra performance to get a mostly smooth experience just sucks. Even with that, during moments FPS still gets very spikey and drops well below 60 FPS. It shouldn't take top of the line hardware to play this game smoothly.

My experience is as a solo player. I do believe from what I have seen that most of the game was planned around playing with at least one other player if not a full party.

After that, you get into the gameplay and due to the cost of ammo refills  it feels like the best option is to avoid combat. A single multi vampire fight can cost you several med kits and a good chunk of ammo with very little to refill your stock. Just seems to suggest that stealth is a much better approach than taking the world on. 

You get gated on skill progression with needing extra skill points and levels. Just feels like you are almost forced into taking options you would rather not or just holding onto points for several main quests until you level up. Early on this feels very bad. On top of that, the ultimate is a long recharge and I've only used mine once in hours of playing due to the situational aspect of it and feeling like there isn't enough enemies to justify the wasting of it. Plus where there are enough enemies is an area I am sneaking by due to all my other ammo concerns. (See above)

The story and NPCs feel awkward. Story is told with pictures and a voice over when they could have at least used in game models to animate some of it, but seems they went a cheaper/easier way. Story overall is minimal and doesn't have a lot of depth to it. The NPCs don't have anything interesting to say except at a few points where they are talking to each other and not you. Once those voice lines are over if you talk to them they just say ""Hello"" or ""Hey, what's up?"" or grumble. Feels rather empty of any emotion or life.

Overall, I think the game is ok, but it is in need of help. I just wouldn't recommend anyone buy this if they are making a choice between this and some other entertainment.

Initial thoughts:
As a single player experience it can be okay, but really shines if you play with a group of friends or like-minded players.  Not pug/random friendly; using discord to find players you'll end up with morons going rambro causing you to miss entire story moments.  

Just don't play with randoms.

Redfall,1294810,137693179,"I purchased this game and have already refunded it. Despite the already negative media surrounding the game I wanted to give it a shot. I did and here is why I don't like it.

- $70? Why is this game even $70 in the first place
- The opponent AI is horrible, it is not hard at all to avoid the AI. They just mindlessly chase you and can get stuck on stuff easily.
- If you play Co-Op on another players save you do not progress individually and will have to start over (your level and gear is local, and will transfer, just not your game save)
- The optimization is bad.
- Not enough content, you can speedrun this game, especially if you avoid enemies. 
- The world is empty and meaningless. The only point of exploration is to find locked containers with gear. 
- This is basically borderlands with a smaller amount of content, side objectives, weapons, and features. 

Not worth $70. 

A healthy price for this game to include its current content with the promise that the future updates will fix the optimization, and AI issues would be $30. in my opinion. 

You add more content, more features, more map, more elements, fix the optimization, fix the AI. make your progress carry over. give the world more personality and a reason to explore then maybe it will be worth $70.

1. Glitches like crazy. Things like the flashlight either not turning on or just flickering and taking multiple presses to get health.
2. Crashing. The game has crashed on me 4 times. It's making it very difficult to play.
3. Graphics. Screen tearing, frame rate drops, and very poor graphical fidelity for a game that is supposed to be brand new.
4. The AI is pretty poor. Fallout 3 and Skyrim have better AI than this game. It ruins what would otherwise be fun gun play.
5. This is nitpicky, but the cut scenes are really weak. From a game like this, I want full blown and gorgeous cinematics. Not these still cuts with very little voice over. Makes the game feel cheap and not finished.
6. Price. This isn't an issue that is specific to this game and in general, it's a worthwhile debate to be had. Personally, I think raising game prices is greedy and lame, but with this game even more so. Specifically, because the game has clearly been released in an unfinished state. If I had forked over 70 bucks for this mess, I'd be pissed too.

I think this game should have been delayed while they polished it up, the bones are there, but they absolutely failed on the execution.

The theme is pretty nice and the gunplay in combo with your powers feels fun to use and experiment with. I will however say that the world can at times feel a bit empty depending on how much you look around and loot and how much you just rush from place to place. Hoping more enemies will be added within reasonable time.

Haven't gotten far into the story but seems interesting too so far. 

Had some hiccups when we tried to play as a trio with Aim Down Sight (ADS) bugging out and one of our friends randomly getting kicked out and such. After I believe it was our 2nd reset. Playing with friends also has a rather unique system that I personally atleast haven't seen before. Staying close to allies when doing stuff like killing a vampire, finishing a mission etc will grant you with essentially friendship which in turn also unlocks more dialog options since your characters basically get to know eachother better in game.

Overall, I'd recommend this for most people that like Borderlands like games, pretty chill and casual game so far playing on normal diff(dusk).

This game is a pile of poo poo caca. Arcane used to make good games before. Despite that the current game is boring, bland and has no story. It is really bad, moreover this dumbster is not optimized well, leaving you with stutters beyond this world. This game smells like crap and developers were pooping while making it and eating their own shit at the same time. Budget for cutscene's was probably stolen by French Arcane division to throw poop at the police. Absolute brain rot of the game stay away from it.

3) Short story(I would call it a romance book that one lady wrote but nobody buys it)
4) Forgettable characters( You don't get attached to them unlike developers that get attached to eating avocado toast while making this ""game""

Cons:
1) Developer ate pork before making the game
2) I smelled the game through my monitor
3) Bad gun play 
4) Bad map design
5) Shit quests
6) Where are puzzles that Arcane is famous for? 
7) Shooting has aim assists

Redfall,1294810,137692414,"I feel like despite Arkane's efforts, it's a game that's really meant to be played with more than one person. What might be empty streets with nothing happening are set dressings for a character exchange about this or that. If you treasure lore, narrative, and characters, any issues you might have gameplay-wise are hardly noticeable.

Vibe-wise, it's sort of like Borderlands gameplay, with the Secret World's setting (loosely, just WRT the supernatural stuff in an urban setting), and with Dishonored's mission set-ups. 

Give it a try for a while, 'cause it's one of those build ups that are slow at the start, but get pretty cool the farther in you go. And all of it much more fun when played with others.

And, really, the bugs are hardly anything game-breaking (just funny at best and minor inconveniences at worst), and early day patches will definitely be clearing them up.",True,7,514

The closest description I have for my 2 hours right now is: GENERATION ZERO, but with Vampires that are stupider than a brick thrown against a wall. 

I've played on the hardest difficulty available. I thought the people were just having bugs, but no. The AI is truly fucking stupid. You can literally quite 4-5 idiots in circles, and they can't do shit to you. The most dangerous enemy is the American, aka the cultists. Which are also stupid, as they just... stand still.

Redfall,1294810,137692250,"Oh boy, what were they thinking?

tl;dr: I'd wait a month or two. It seems fixable, but I can't recommend it at its current price and in its current state.

My Redfall experience started out with the game launching on the wrong monitor with the wrong resolution. I mean, you'd think that this was a solved problem in 2023, but it's not. Now, normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, you just hop into the settings menu etc. But, you see, Redfall has such an integrated ""Online Experience™"" that it cannot let you proceed into the options menu _before_ you create your Bethesda.net™®© Account™. This is not a technical problem. The game manages let you access the accessibility settings, just not the visual settings. I don't know why I need a Bethesda.net™®© Account™ for Redfall, I just know that if I hit ""Cancel"" I'm back to the start screen.

Now since, the Bethesda.net™®© Account™ is such an integral part of the ""Online Experience™"", I'd say, it's fair game to include the Bethesda.net™®© Account Experience in the review.
The good parts:
 + I wasn't automatically signed up for a newsletter (Swiss IP address, might be different for other countries)
The bad parts:
 - Opting out of ""marketing campaigns"" requires entering the answer to the security question (security questions in 2023? really?). I bet this was intentional to create as much friction as possible for people who want to opt out
 - two factor authentication set up does not offer a way to back up the ""setup code"" or generate ""backup codes""
 - they are trying to trick you into handing over your phone number (for account recovery, allegedly, but we all know that these phone numbers will find convenient other uses)
 - out of the gate, your Bethesda.net™®© Account™ username is some random garbage (instead of, oh I don't know, using your Steam name as the basis for the user name). That means that you have to go to the Bethesda.net™®© Account™ website, finish your registration and then re-launch the game, if you want a proper ingame name

Ok, now on to the actual game. Let's address the co-op Elephant in the room: PROGRESS IS NOT SHARED. Let that sink in for a sec. Sure, everyone keeps their levels and loot, etc. but only the ""host"" gets to progress their mission (""host""? What is this 2003?). That means that if (and given the state of the game: big IF) you manage to convince your 3 friends to play redfall with you, you will have to do every mission 4 times. For a game that _seems_ to be designed around co-op (heavy Borderlands vibes), this is absolutely bizarre to me. Just WTF were they thinking?! I just... what?

Gameplay: I don't know, didn't get to see much. Tutorial section is pretty long. Then I went on my first mission, but if you play solo, it's got big dark souls energy in the sense that when you go down, the mission is over. You re-spawn back at the headquarters. I didn't bother to find out how much of the overworld persists. Just the time spent walking back turned me off. I don't have any cool abilities unlocked and only the shittiest of weapons. Doesn't exactly scream fun.

Performance: Big ""eh"". The game runs ""fine"" on a AMD 7950X3D and an nVidia RTX 3080 (10GB). I get ~95 fps on epic settings. But it's absolutely not perfect. 
 - There are frequent stutters (things loading in?)
 - The menu (inventory!) takes 3-4 seconds to load (WTF?)
 - Closing the menu halves in-game fps for 3-4 seconds (WTF²?! As if the menu was still running in the background or something idiotic like that). Since this is a ""Online Experience™"", the game isn't paused while you are in a menu. That means that when you get attacked while sorting through your inventory, you get to fight off the cultists in ""cinematic"" 30 fps -_- 
 - Oh and of course: the inventory also sometimes drops down to 15fps

HDR support: yes, but not great
 - You don't get to set UI brightness. The UI is waaaaaaay too bright on an DisplayHDR 1000 display. 
 - You don't get to set brightness in nits (there is only a relative ""+1"", ""+3"" kind of slider. Who knows what that really does?!)
 + Looks okay for the most part

Polish: Also ""eh""
 + Love the art style
 + Cut scenes are ""efficient"" slide shows (but if my money didn't go into cut scenes, where else did it go?!)
 - Difficult to tell whether you are crouching or not (other games have different gun stances or an icon. In Redfall, the edges of your screen go a bit dark. Really difficult to tell when you are sneaking/walking around in, oh I don't know, the dark?)
 - Speech animations look shit
 - Foliage looks shit
 - Map ""Ping"" marker has a pointy end at the bottom, but the thing it points to is not the location of the marker. The location of the marker is in the middle of the marker.",False,2,90

Redfall,1294810,137691940,"""Well with each good thing a little rain must fall, in this case Red Fall"" 



I got this for free and can't recommend it currently. 
Came with a video card purchase. Pale (a buddy) asked me if the video card worked well, and I said yes... He then produced the best explanation of the situation:

""Well with each good thing a little rain must fall, in this case Red Fall"" 

I about died laughing so thought I would share.



Gun play is fun, animations for killing the vampires, ect are fun.. the running speed vs leg movement is entertainingly wonky... 

The mechanics are fun so far, and the world is interesting and well pathed. Well pathed out could be a good or bad thing. It's open world, but there are paths and roads leading everywhere so just wandering around still has you going down the same paths it seems. 

There are actual choices but they are limited. You can stealth in somewhere, but not stealth take out an enemy... odd.  Guns blazing in this one is usually the most fun option. 

Separate loot for everyone! That's a good thing!
No story progress even if you all start the game together, except for the host... this sucks.
Multi player is fun, but they have a huge flaw, and that's that a character is an un-moveable wall... you can not push past each other, if you stop, you stop. So if someone is afk in a door way, well... you can never complete that quest until they move. They log out just before you complete or you DC? then the host also gets booted and loses all progress on said mission... it's a very very bad way to have a multi player game coded. 
Dialog can be started by anyone, they just speak into the world... if you miss it you miss it.. to bad. Can't go back and restart it or anything like that. On a similarly annoying note, you can not skip any dialog what so ever, so if you are on a new character play through, you are stuck with it all over again. 

You can skip cutscenes. So +1 there.

Hardly any graphics options at all. Thought this was supposed to be a ray tracing demo of sorts again but there is zero options for it. The graphics options are like console options. ""Look good or look bad"" and that's basically all they give you.

all in all, the game is fun to play though, and it's fun with friends. For the price tag though (I got it for free...) being as high as it is on the store, hard pass. This feels like a churned out 30 dollar game right now. Maybe if they update it and make some changes it will feel better. 

Current Bugs:
If you Disconnect from each other, you may lose all progress, or just some progress.... but most likely you will lose at least some progress. Have had all three things happen. 

Some items don't spawn for everyone due to individual loot and, idk why I'm not a dev... All I know is I had to run through enemies without a weapon while my friends were blasting away because the initial weapon drop didn't happen for me. 

Audio issues, floating through the air isssues, connection issues, graphical issues and able to glitch through locked doors, the list goes on...

Will I still play it? Yes, it's interesting enough and fun enough with others to get my attention.

So why thumbs down a game I'll play?
 The price, it's simply not worth paying their asking for something as broken as this or with the just horrible game play choices... Some are fantastic, others are terrible. The ones that are terrible are so bad that they over ride multiple up points for me.

It's OK, not great, but OK. Hopefully they fix the progress loss because that is just not something I'm interested in dealing with in any game.",False,11,291

The open world is empty and boring. There's no secret lore and/or side-quests to discover. Exploring is pointless. Buildings might as well be cardboard cutouts you can see, but not enter. 

Combat is terrible: enemy AI is nonexistent, you never feel more powerful leveling up your skills, half your skills are for coop only (sorry solo players), switching weapons is a pain. The game suggests using stealth for missions, but there's ZERO REWARDS for stealth, so you might as well go in guns ablazing.

Storyline is just plain bad. With minimal cutscenes and storyboards instead! Storyboards are apparently the cool thing to do.

I am an old, and am more than happy with the performance of a nice steady 30fps with no stuttering or any other issues. My machine is  good, but not completely insane, with a Ryzen 3500X (3.6Ghz), 32GB of RAM, and an AMD 5600XT

EDIT: Now up to 16 hours and I still like it. It seems that I must be broken or something judging by other people's reactions to this game.

Turn DLSS Off, stops stuttering completely

I'm sure they will look into patching it in the future I get no issues with DLSS turned off

I have since played a few hours and have now updated my review with the following:
Turning DLSS off did help immediately, but transitioning into any new area per launch of the game gives stutter lag, like incredible amounts. IF you can through this the game works fine but be prepared to have heavy amounts of stutter lag for every new area you enter into, everytime you launch the game.

What has annoyed me is there is still no patch to fix any issues or any communication via steam about this.

This is an overpriced flop so far and I have switched my review to a big thumbs down.

The game is great (when it works) but until compatability and graphical/CPU overload issues are sorted I would wait.",False,2,240
Redfall,1294810,137686162,"Things that are good:
- Gameplay: Different classes and their abilities are fun! The variety at which I can go at enemies isn't a new formula for Arkane, but enjoyable in this game like their others.
- Freedom of movement: Again, like in other Arkane games, the ability to sneak, climb, and move about freely allows me to decide when and where I want to engage enemies.
- Variety of guns: My favorite so far has got to be the UV gun and crisping up the vamps for shattering! Hopefully they add more later, I think a modified brass knuckles with a stake would be hilarious fun at some point.

Things that need work:
- Loot: finding a gold weapon every few minutes make them seem less special, and I shouldn't find them in random bags that don't require a lockpick/wiring kit. Perhaps tweaking the %'s at which certain loot is dropped can help with this.
- AI: definitely needs improving, enemies run into walls a lot!
- Optimization: I have a 3070, i7 10700K (4.0Ghz), and 32 gigs of ram and on avg I get between 70-80 fps on Ultra settings, but it certainly dips to 30 fps on cluttered fights and looking at the big water wave in the distance (and that's with DLSS on). Definitely needs some work here to ensure a bit smoother gameplay across the board.
- Enemy density: at times it feels TOO empty, but on certain fights feels overwhelming. There should be some tweaking here. I'm not saying there needs to be enemies on every street corner, but also I shouldn't feel like there suddenly an overwhelming tide of baddies because I want to check out a new POI.
- Progression: Give players who join their friends the option to tie progression to the host or not (at least with new characters). 
- Back and forth banter between characters: feels repetitive at times is all, I will have to see if it improves with the ""trust"" building system 

Overall the game is a great time in co-op, haven't played it much solo though beyond the intro mission. A lot of the extra lore bits feel unnecessary, but I understand it is part of the world building. I would say pick it up, but maybe wait until some tweaks are made, or price drops.

The game runs Okay if you have literally some of the best hardware money can buy, but even then it is dire.
Yeah the framerate and frametimes were fine... but everything else just feels so unpolished and bad.

I got through the tutorial mission and just had to stop because it was giving me a headache.
I was playing on ultra, had a solid 120 FPS as 2k with DLAA, but also tried just native (native was worse looking).

Ultra shadows... shadows are pixely and crusty.
Ultra textures... they're fine.

I didn't have any of the stuttering others have had... but the game just feels unpolished and janky.
The models and the animations are ugly as sin.. even for the stylized stuff Arkane goes for, which I typically adore.
The character models look like souless copies of borderlands characters after squeezing their heads in a vice.

And the biggest, most headache causing issue by several miles.
LOD pop in.
It is AWFUL.
Especially with bits of set dressing in the fire station, good lord.
You can be about 20 feet away and it pops between some terrible LOD that has missing faces (the windows were the worst) to the full detail when you take one step closer.
This is in a room that has hardly any items in it, just a corner with a shelf and 2 windows.
Why in whatever gods you may pray too would this happen to this degree on ULTRA SETTINGS

I had to stop playing due to that alone because it made me want to vomit. I have never had this issue before, it legitimately made me feel nauseous.

Next is the animations.
The character animations especially are just Bad.
Some of the worst I have ever seen. Its like freaking five nights at freddies animatronics up in here.
Enemies snap from animation to animation with no perceivable smoothing between each one, they go from running and holding a gun in both hands to aiming with no frames of animation in between, arms snapping from bent downwards to forward in a microsecond.

There are clipping issues galore, I know its an open world game but if I can casually wander around the opening area of the game and see props clipped into each other, floating, or half in a wall... you need to do better. 
That just shows how much the poor folks who had to try to make this were rushed.

This game could have easily spent another 6 to 8 months in the oven.

Redfall,1294810,137685954,"The game is okay.

Not great, or even good, but certainly not terrible.

It has a lot of glaring issue. Textures don't load, AI bugs out, it gets very slow at times, and is lacking a lot of polish. It's embarrassing.

But to say this game is awful, or one the worst games I've played, would be lying. 

The main texture that doesn't load is the pocket map (not the in-menu map), and that's only once every so often. 
AI problems only happen once every, say, 30 minutes. Even then, it's usually just a walk cycle not loading. The combat abilities of the AI are mediocre, but they still pose a challenge.
I can run the game at 60 FPS with most of my settings on high with lag spikes only happening in very cluttered areas. 
And the lack of polish is in places that I don't really care about. Sure, cut-scenes *should* be animated, and chimneys *should* not be copy pasted on top of houses, but I'm not in desperate need of a mini-movie or wanting to inspect every house for flaws.

I'm not here to defend these noticeable issues, but if these ruin the game for you, you're probably not here for actual gameplay.

And the gameplay is fine. Not great or the most unique, but if you genuinely hate it, you should not be playing this genre of game.

Redfall,1294810,137685583,"[b]Disclaimer:[/b]  I think it's a bit silly to review a game after spending only a few minutes playing it but such are the times, yes? (and for those that missed it, this is intentional irony)

I was one of those fellas who saw this game from a distance, had his interest piqued, added to wishlist and then forgot about it until just a few days before release.  Like many folks here, I balked at the price - 70 bucks is already pretty steep but I'm also one who likes to spend that little extra and gets some goodies too.  100 bucks is a lot of cheddar to throw down on a game that you know little to nothing about aside from what the devs have released.

Still, I took the gamble and made my purchase.  The premise sounded fun and playing a game that supposedly can be enjoyed either solo or in co-op mode made the choice a bit easier.  Plus, I just need something to tide me over until D4 launches in over a month.

I played until I cleared out and established the first safehouse.  For some folks, this is only a few short minutes of gameplay.  Personally, I took my time and explored.  By the time I encountered my first cultist, I was armed with pistol, shotgun, and sniper rifle, had full med packs, and already a fair bit of what passes as currency.

My immediate impression was that this felt like Funcom's Secret World (anyone remember that?) from way back - but in FPS mode.  Lots of bits and pieces of environmental storytelling - humanizes some of the dead bodies you encounter all over the place.  I like the art and graphics style.  Some folks have called it cartoonish or reminiscent of '90s quality but I have to disagree.  It's a style choice on the devs' part and I think it suits the game just fine.  In fact, my son came in and watched me play a bit and he immediately recognized the Dishonored vibes.  (I never played Dishonored so I am not sure what he was picking up on)

I am typically a cautious gamer so I go slow, peeking around corners, using flashlight sparingly, and taking note of voices and the clearing of throats.  I was a little surprised at the lack of enemy density but again, still early.  I didn't have any trouble dispatching cultists (they are terrible shots) and my little robot buddy kept the basement bloodsucker busy until I blasted him enough times to eventually stake him.  I like the tense moments leading up to the basement encounter and I hope there ends up being a lot more of that.  

Gunplay wasn't bad.  I felt that it was a bit sluggish at first but I quickly acclimated and soon wasn't having any issues. The sniper rifle seems to miss half the time - which could be some of that latency that folks have complained about.  Otherwise, the other guns I've tried (pistol and shotgun) work great.

I didn't experience any technical difficulties or performance issues, though I did have textures sometimes not render fully in some cases.  I don't have an uber setup but am running a 1070 Ti with 32 gigs of RAM - I really didn't have any major issues at all (still early though).

[b]To sum up my list of pros, neutrals, and cons:[/b]

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*]Open World - lots to explore, climb and traverse.  If you like environmental storytelling, this one has it in spades.
    [*]Environment - detailed, beautiful, grim, and ghostly 
    [*]Atmosphere - tense and foreboding (you never know what might be lurking around yon corner - sadly though, it's too often nothing at all....)
    [*]Compelling story - I like a story driven experience and so far I am intrigued.  I am looking forward to uncovering more.
[/list]

[b]Neutral[/b]
[list]
    [*]Combat - It's pretty straightforward. Nothing too fancy - though it might shine a bit more as you get more abilities and such
    [*]Co-op - Haven't played it so I can't comment.  Looks like it might be fun to play off of others' abilities 
    [*]Performance - Though I have had no real issues, small things here and there like texture rendering and such add up and make me think there is room for improvement.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*]Price/Value - This is kind of a big one.  I've enjoyed the game but haven't been knocked off my socks yet.  Is this game worth the cheese?  I think that this is in the eye of the beholder really but I won't be getting a refund so I expect to get my money's worth.  I don't think the value is there quite yet though.
    [*]Lack of enemy density and jump scares - This may come later in the game but I want my tension to be justified, darn it!
    [*]Brain dead AI - Cultists are just dumb.  Which is a fine representation because cultists in real life are, in fact, dumb.  Still, I hope for more challenging encounters all the same.  Perhaps later in the game or maybe some retroactive tuning.
[/list]

[b]Conclusion[/b]

Yes, I would recommend the game if you enjoy a slower paced, open world, story driven experience that also has a co-op component should you want to play with some buddies.  Plus, you get to stake vamps and murder cultists - all great fun. That said, the hefty price tag is a justifiable deterrent and I expect that they will continue to bring a lot of heat for releasing a game in its current state at such a steep price point.  It's worth picking up on a sale and/or waiting on them to patch with some fixes and improvements though - especially if you like the above noted attributes.

I am enjoying myself so far and hopefully the game will get to a state where more of you can as well.

**END OF EDIT**

Before launch, this game received a lot of hate for various reasons , and from what I've read and seen , it just seems like a hate-train without much to justify it. Aside from the console release where the game is apparently locked into 30 FPS or something, I really don't see anything that terrible about the game. Sure the price is higher than what most people were used to pay for until now. But beyond that, I found the game to be quite fun so far, and I've been playing it solo, I would assume that playing it with a bunch of like-minded friends would just make it even better.

I have not ran into any performance issue. My pc specs are as follows :
RTX 4070 TI
Ryzen 7 7700x
32GB DDR5 5600mhz
Samsung 970 Evo plus SSD
27.0"" 2560 x 1440 144 Hz main Monitor

My PC build is newly made as of last month, I have every graphic setting to max, with motion blur off.
Games run fine , the overall game-play loop is simple but fun. I only played it about 3 hours so far and will log more hours into it. For now I still fully recommend this game to anyone who likes first person shooter looter with decent amount of exploration, free roaming , and co-operative play. If you think the asking price is too high , just wait for a sale honestly, in the end , the game will still be as fun and will have more updates.",True,4,536
Redfall,1294810,137684854,"Was really hoping the marketing was just not doing this game justice, but Arkane has absolutely missed the mark here. The gunplay is... fine, but the abilities feels so uninspired that I forget I have them. The upgrades seem okay but don't seem like they'll make that much of an improvement. Movement feels stiff, nothing like how fluid their prior games feel.  And how does this game not have a stealth takedown option?

Graphics are okay. They aren't doing much to emphasize the Arkane art direction besides the bigger vamps themselves. The way they move and look is very cool, but the other 90% is pretty flat. Performance is okay. For the most part on an i7-12700k and 4070ti, I can maintain 120fps at 1080p with maximum settings and DLSS, but there are sometimes where it chugs for multiple seconds. At this resolution, I should not be getting any of those moments.

Audio is another big issue. Sound effects and voicelines just don't seem well mixed and often don't play at all. Some of the dialogue itself is cool, especially the radio transmissions from The Hollow Man, but character to character dialogue is bland bland bland.

I'm not sure this game would be better with friends, but it may distract me from the lackluster exploration, which stings especially compared to how rewarding and interesting exploration has felt in past Arkane titles.  On the note of co-op, let me pause your game while playing by myself.

Its still fun! As the game progresses more stuff to do unlocks. I'm really happy to have another game that allows me to decide not only if I want to do side mission stuff, but different missions are different time lengths. Also, as more unlocks the gratification to clear whole zoned side-missions is greatly enjoyable. Now that all my characters abilities are unlocked (does so with progression) I can better see how each character is best utilized in each mission scenario. The first couple hours in I couldn't see how useful Remi was, but as we got further into large fights or boss fights then I absolutely can see how she is needed as a healer or using the robot decoy feature to give you a few extra seconds to heal up when swarmed by vamps. Oh and Devs teleport option?!  *chefs kiss*  Amazing.  


3 hours in and its great! Some things could absolutely be tweaked (Loot rarity drops seem really abundant. Maybe more enemies while out exploring, but I also could bump up the difficulty right?)

Solid 8/10 game. 

Recommending because it's been fun for me and i've really got a huge amount of enjoyment out of this game. Despite what people think this is very much an Arkane game with lots of their style and gameplay elements littered if you just give it some time and go looking for them.

You can't play this game like its Division. Neither is it Left 4 Dead. Its an Arkane game with some looting RNG. But primarily this game is about the story. It is about finding different ways to aproach a situation and it is about exploring the game world for the huge amount of detail and care the developers have put into it. 

Only then will you uncover a trully wonderful game that falls a little flat of its ambitions. But a great game is still there for those that can look past the few bugs. 

Coop is way more of a mess. I play mostly single player and experience very few bugs. I tried coop and it was filled with all kinds of bugs.

What i see here is Sea of Thieves at launch. A game that has potential and has been crafted with love and ambition but that has fallen a little flat. I believe if the developers are given more time and support from Microsoft they can turn this into something really wonderful. 

That said with many many hours of gameplay, the more time you give this game the more it will give you back. The more i play the more i love it and i'm still not bored. I look forward to playing this at the end of each day when i've finished work and the kids are in bed.

Are there issues? Yes
Does the game feel somewhat half baked in places? Yes
Is it as terrible as the discussions or steam reviews want you to believe? Not at all. 

The main issue is at the price point its horribly underwhelming and from a studio like Arkane people expected much more.

Games like Dishonored, Prey or even Deathloop were unique worlds and instantly fun and different and while its great to see the Arkane style out in an open world and its nice to see them try something new it just lacks some of the stuff that really makes an Arkane game great.  

The environment and atmosphere are all fantastic and the game feels creepy. 
The storytelling is also wonderful but you have to work for it. It's like a big book that is difficult to get into but once you allow yourself to be come immersed the more it gives you back in return. For example, one of the best legendary perk pickups in the game isn't signposted. You may or may not come across a house with some clues and locked doors. You then can choose to follow the clues and read notes to uncover a pretty chilling and grim tale of three sisters who murdered a sibling as an offering. In return you get a really powerful legendary. But none of this is handed to you or signposted.

There are plenty of things like this throughout the game. Nothing is handed to you other than the main questline and even this has pieces you really have to slow down and pay attention to or notes to read or recordings to listen to if you want the full picture. For me that is great. I love it as it immerses you into the world and it all feels very Arkane.

Graphically its fine. Its stylised. Its Arkane through and through. Some have performance issues. For me i get a smooth locked 60fps at 4k on max settings which is just fine. I get the occasional dip once in a while which i presume is the game loading some stuff and in a couple of very wide areas with alot going on my frames might drop but none of this has hampered gameplay in any way. As with all games this stuff will improve over patches and driver updates over time.

At first the class system felt dull to me but as you unlock deeper skill variants and learn how to use them in different ways each character has its own very unique play style. I'm playing two characters and really enjoying both right now. 
I'm looking forward to seeing what the other two characters will bring to the table.

I also hope that they add another map to the game but somehow i don't see that happening as it would be a pretty huge undertaking.

Are there improvements needed?
Yes. Of course. Lots of the broad complaints are valid. The way people are going about making them is not. Its childish and indicitive of a very problematic issue that plagues gaming communites. People have no clue how to interact or behave. This is an issue you see over every game launch and getting worse over time. Steam harbors this toxic behaviour and does nothing to stem it. I'd be surprised if the devs bothered to even read some of the stuff posted here just because of how its being presented. The irony is if these things were presented in a sensible fashion they might actually get listened to.

Right now their behaviour is no different from a toddler who doesn't get exactly what they want so they have a tantrum and then get even more upset because they don't understand why no one takes them seriously.

Regardless i'm happy that Arkane were given the space to try something new and i hope that they are given the space to turn it into something even better.",True,48,4977

Delayed for about 6 months, collided with Starfields release window, exclusive IGN previews that were so bad it hurt to watch, locked 30 FPS on Xbox consoles, launches on PC with Denuvo. From the start this game was dealt a bad hand. So now that launch is here can it fix all of that?

No.

""Redfall is a pretty decent indie game from a small inexperienced studio priced at $30 USD."" That's all I could think of in my head as I played through this game, which is obviously not even remotely true. Gunplay is poor, player characters are kind of annoying and repeat the same lines every couple of minutes, mission objectives are boring, the map is tiny (I'm all for smaller maps but this is pathetic), and the game runs like 30-50 fps on my 3090ti at the lowest settings.

It's not all bad. The classes are quite diverse and the game is fun to absent-mindedly dick around in with friends. I'd say if you can get at least one friend to play this game with and the game price dropped to $20 USD, I could see this being a fun romp.",False,11,260

Some people say the graphics are ""old"" and choppy, but I've yet to have glitches or anything of that sort.

So sorry that AI isn't overtuned to one-shot players who have spent half their lives in COD doing flick-shots and PvP. Starting the game, I had a sense of immediate dread when enemies were 100ft from the opening scene and gave me cause to stealth around instead of just going in guns-blazing. Not that one style of gameplay is better than another, as it all comes down to personal preference. 

If your preference is Destiny'ing your way through waves of enemies until you happen to die and expect to just keep bashing your head against a wall until you win, this might not be the game for you. Maybe try to enjoy the game for what it is and not compare it to other games that it isn't?

Cons:
- $70 price tag
- poorly optimized
- mediocre story

I think most public sentiment right now is just bashing for funsies, I just want to be clear that this is an Arkane fan moving on.

There doesn't appear to be a lick of ""immersive sim"" in this game due to the completely lackluster enemies in the game. You have a bit of agency in your approach to a situation (as in... physically what direction you walk up to the braindead baddies from), but the enemies may as well be catatonic which stifles interaction. Even Deathloop's enemies were able to be lethally dealt with in interesting ways. Non-lethal just isn't a thing in this game. Stealth overall just feels like a crouch toggle and an invisibility skill that both do very very little in the face of player choice.

Arkane usually does a great job with world-building and storytelling, those are the MAIN reasons I purchase their games, but this game's lack of cohesion in any of its elements leads to a narrative that gets whispered to you through the noise of all the mess that is the rest of the game.

This is MY experience of Redfall which I very much enjoyed so far despite the mostly negative reviews.
First of all, it runs perfectly fine on my PC (RTX 3060, i9-10700K, 16 GB) with more or less steady 60 fps (depending on the area I'm in) on high graphic settings with a few adjustments. This game is basically what I was expecting when I heard vampire themed open-world co-op fps and I can see myself spending a lot more time on this game.

Aside from a bug with the sniper scope and my crosshair disappearing once during the 7 hours I played, there were no game breaking glitches or bugs that made it unplayable. 
Also, I'm surprised at how well the multiplayer works! We had no big issues with it and even cross play with the game pass worked well. I was worried at first because I expected the co-op to be a pain in the ass like lobbies crashing every other second and my friends joining the game I'm hosting just lagging around all the time, but nope.

The graphics for me, well it looks okay. It's not the prettiest game I played but definitely not the ugliest either. For me the experience and the fun I'm having in a game matters way more than graphics.
The enemy AI is kinda dumb, could be better (give the cultist more aim jesus they hit almost as bad as me in Valorant) and even on the highest difficulty so far, it's not overly challenging (unless you blow up your friend with your c4 charge while fighting an underboss).
The music is great, there's a good variety of guns and an overall nice atmosphere  
Interactions with npcs are, well...so far kinda meh and while playing co-op the characters just repeat the same voice lines a bit too often imo.
Love the different types of vampires I've seen so far and can't wait to find the rest of them. 
Honestly, I could spend hours just exploring the city, for me it's not at all bland or boring like other people say it is.

The game does need a few patches for me to consider it a great game tho. But is it worth 70€? We all know it's overpriced, that's a fact. But for me, I'm sure I'll get enough play time to make it worth the price and if you can't see yourself spending this much on a game you can't get yourself into liking, don't buy it.
Also, some of you had a certain, not so great preconception of the game and didn't even give it a proper chance to prove you wrong.

There's a good concept at the core, especially surrounding the day/night cycle...but then the vampires just stroll around in broad daylight after the second morning? I couldn't figure out if that was a glitch or not, but it certainly killed any sense of tension and pacing that could've been created there.

Many things felt unfinished (the first wave of cultists attacked me by running backwards while i was standing in the open, yelling about how they'd find me - that bug was worth the download size on its own), the AI pathfinding needs serious work (the vampires can fly and teleport, so if im standing on a ledge they cant reach, maybe they could just throw something at the player while hovering there? currently they just kinda freak out, run in circles, then go full-on ""it must have been the wind""), the gunplay is seriously lacking feedback and the enemies don't flinch from most hits short of a point blank shotgun, melee is an afterthought, and performance/optimization is abysmally uneven. the option to play with locked framerate (other than just vsync) would have been nice, too, since that tends to work a bit better with streaming clients like OBS.

Oh.  Should maybe say some more huh?  Okay.

The basics of an Open World Loot-n-Shoot with story elements RPGish game are present.  The world can seem empty, but more target rich or loot filled would unbalance the game play.  Leaning to maintain stealth, ADS toggle, and other QoL options would make this game better.  The skill tree may be okay, but have not leveled enough to see how it works.  I wish some crafting, and weapon modding, had been implemented.  Story is interesting, and I am hoping to learn more.  I am not sure if this is a graphic or game mechanic problem but enviromental damage (fire, explosions, etc) are not always easy to notice.  I walk into a burning area that looked more like fluttering dead leaves.  So for this far I remain middle ground of Redfall is a game, and some may like it.

As for the graphics I will say that things did not work as I expected.  The optimized preset for my hardware did not work well.  My rig is okay: AMD Ryzen 5900X, 32 GB DDR4 3600Mhz, AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX 24 GB, NVME SSD, Win10 22H2.  Monitor is a 2560x1440 144Hz display.  It was 40 - 60 fps with grainy odd looking textures.  Eventually I got this to improve to 144 fps avg.  Turning off FSR/resolution scaling was the first big help.  Then I could tweak other setting to where I tend to run games.  Hitching is still a minor thing.  Also minor visual effects that do not look right (some flames, random item physics).  Not sure if Nvidia problems are for the same reasons.

To put it simply, the game just isn't fun. I didn't hate it, but I couldn't bring myself to like it either.
Gunplay is fine, and I didn't have technical issues.
My opinion of the game started to drop right after clearing the first base you get. The transition from freeing this building with survivors to it suddenly being a safe haven and immediately apart of some little community you run errands for was really jarring to me on a story standpoint.

You then accept your next quest from a mission board instead of narrative storytelling, further plummeting my current low opinion of the story thus far. Going to the quest location felt very bare and bland. The scenery and setting was nice, but I couldn't find any excitement. The enemies are bad. The humans with guns had horrible AI and the vampires were chumps with easily avoidable attacks. I was playing on the hardest difficulty I could and I felt no danger.

I encountered a few minor bugs, like shooting a still enemy and the bullet not hitting them. I was disappointed to find a major lack of different and in depth character abilities to pick and choose from like previous Arkane games, instead left with a few very lackluster skills with plain skill trees. I didn't bother with the multiplayer, heard it was broken anyway. 

Very disappointed in the game, maybe I'll revisit it in the future after some updates and heavy sales. The game is in no way worth $70 and I'm requesting a refund. Save the money and go play Dishonored or Prey if you haven't.",False,29,113

I want to love this game, and defend it.. but after seeing the endless bugs, glitches, lack of mobs, repetitive gameplay, bad mob mechanics, and lack of achievement sharing.. I can't recommend this game. I wouldn't recommend buying this game for anything more than $25. This feels like an unfinished game.. There are multiple areas in the map that are clearly unfinished.. I shouldn't be able to walk into a cabinet, or glitch into a rock when climbing.. or not be able to step up a rock because the devs decided not to play the game and make a working walking path.. 
There are some fun parts of the game.. but why is Layla the most worthless character when she is portrayed as powerful in the story? The umbrella is the most useless ability, the elevator is only really good for getting on a roof or hill.. and using the ult takes time and lasts seconds.. 
This game needs updating, which seems like wont really be happening. IF they decide to update this game and fix the issues, I would recommend the game then.. but right now - no.

Original Review @ 3.5 hours: 
Left 4 Dead meets Vampires except the characters can actually perform abilities instead of just standing there shooting.
I have enjoyed this game thus far, gaining access to this game right on release. No initial issues entering into the game - An actual plus considering the majority of releases lately have had issues which seems to be the norm.
Do I think the price tag is high? Yes. 
Do I have performance issues? No. 

I think the biggest issue with this game is the lack co-op story completion and achievements. Story completion should be shared between all players in the lobby. All achievements, stats, and loot should be shared within the lobby. I think keeping everything separate like they are now, is kinda killin the vibe. 
I am still pretty early into the game, so I cannot speak on difficulty as the game may progress to be much more difficult.

Overall I find the game fun and enjoyable. I think that if you're on the fence because of price - wait. But if you want a fun time with friends, I think this is a good option.",False,1,1492

There are a few bugs that could be better like the grave locks they stop counting in the archive at 81 and start to repeat the earlier ones at random so you dont get to hear the rest of her story, it does at least count to 100 in the skills tab so the achievement pops. 

The unriveled weapons are bugged so that when you load back into the game the secondary perks on them dont work especially with the 10 extra rounds in magazine perks.
It feels like the second part was rushed out, the first map is all about the first vampire god and leads up to him with good story but the second map has all the last three on there and is quite rushed to getting to them and killing them............it feels like it should have been four maps with one dedicated to each vampire god with its own regions and scenery now that would have made it much better with more safehouses and neighbourhoods to clear on each of them. 

Some more collectables would have been nice and alot of variation in weapons not just the same few with the same few unrivaled too.
This could all be added in dlc or patches i guess but its the kind of thing that should be there now as i doubt ill do another playthrough just to see that.

At 50 hours in on my first playthrough I have: 
Achieved 55 ish of the 66 achievements
Completed both maps fully
Gathered all collectables
Done all side quests
Done all safe house missions
Done all main missions apart from the very last black sun mission as that is a job for tomorrow

 So this isnt a content light game unless you speed from main quest to main quest in a cod kid kinda rush way, if you enjoy exploring and collecting items, finding the lore and reading the stories while doing all side content it will keep you busy.

first things first i have a high end PC so i have more spec than the game requires and i still got frame-drops here and there add to that the hiccups for no reason the graphics are last gen so poor optimisation as the trend for PC games nowadays.

the game play is so bad weapon are not responsive you have to click fire twice for your gun to shoot and if you have a burst fire weapon good luck with that, the sniper scoop get stuck on the screen for all weapons which is so annoying and the enemy AI is pathetic at best try to set the game on a higher difficulty you'll see no changes to the AI behaviour, they will stand like they are confused not knowing what to do, when you kill a vampire and need to do a melee attack to finish it the game does not show the melee prompt.

there's only a couple of enemy types that you'll fight over and over and over and over again so i start to skip most of the enemy i find in my way because they gets repetitive so fast

the world as empty there's noting that makes you want to go out of your way to explore the map the story is told through a slide show the missions are not interesting just Fitch quest or go clear locations.

the game is a buggy mess you will get stock too many times that you'll stop counting.

Redfall,1294810,137675305,"I was going to save my review for after I played some more, but I woke up at 5 am literally angry about last night's experience with this game. Thanks to NVIDIA for footing the bill, I guess, because if I had of paid money for this I would be requesting a refund right now.

First, the release: Like many others I preloaded the 77 gigs ahead of time to avoid a huge download at launch, which turned out to be pointless. I was forced to sit through a 76 GB ""patch"" the instant the game finally became available. I'm sure my ISP thanks you for that move, Bethesda.

OK whatever, the game has now been double-installed and we can play. I crank up all the visuals and it looks OK. The giant walls of un-moving water are odd but kind of a neat effect, I find a gun, start running out towards shore and immediately headshot and take down 4 of 5 human enemies that are serving the vampires, I guess. This part was insanely easy, but I was utilizing good aim and using cover like I've been trained to over years of shooter experience. 

But it doesn't really matter. The next group I run into I take down just as easily without using cover, and finally I give up trying to be sneaky and just channel john Wick as I sprint into areas and instantly take down any enemy I see with instant headshots while barely stopping to aim. This game feels very easy. I'm playing on default difficulty, maybe I need to crank it up.

Finally, I run into the first boss and he's instantly taken down with headshots from my handgun but UH-OH I need to finish him off with a stake of some sort... Hmmm how to do that? I go into my loadout mid-battle (no pause by the way). The vampire has now recovered and is talking about eating my guts while he gleefully slashes me up as I am stuck in my loadout menu trying to figure out how to equip a stake. Eventually I recall that I had picked up a shotgun just before the battle began. I equip the shotgun and come out of the menu to see the vampire fully recovered and myself at 10% health. No matter, I shotgun that unholy fellow in the face a few time and FINALLY, Oh OK, I can use my shotgun to stake him.

This is TERRIBLE game play. You have me fumbling around for nearly a full minute in menus WHILE the boss is walloping on me, then I have to make the leap of logic, mid boss battle, to equip a ranged weapon so that I can use a melee weapon that is attached to it? After I have picked up several standalone stakes along the way? Why not just give me a button to stake the vampires, or make it possible to equip a stake in the loadout, or at least make it FAR more obvious when I picked up the shotgun that the one and only usable stake in the game is somehow attached to that.

Whatever... bad vampire ""boss"" is now dead and I get to save our band of trapped civilians and.... Jesus lord. The God of Redfall must really love ugly, because he made a ton of it. The character models in this game are all hideous. The worst affront to our senses being the Reverend Eva Crescenta, who despite having a female voice, looks and acts like a guy who is about to fight you in a bar for spilling a beer on him (her?) by accident. I guess this is some kind of a hamfisted attempt to shoehorn a trans character in the game, but it comes across terrible. For a much better way to do it look (ironically) at Hogwart's Legacy and the Serona character for an example of how to do it right. Or Maybe Eva isn't trans at all and the character design team.... No, wtf else could they have been doing? The character is terrible. The worst. None of the others are much better. Also, why does the pregnant woman act like she's drunk?

Anyway so now I have a base of operations and a rag tag team of support people. The doctor tells me I can come see him for medical supplies but to only take what I need, as others need it too. No problem doc, my backpack is already so full of medical supplies from what I picked up running through town that I couldn't possibly take any more. Got a donation box where I can put some extras? There's also an armory where I can't yet afford to upgrade my weapons and some other random areas. I head to mission overview and get briefed on my next mission, but it's too boring to follow and I get distracted by something on my phone and decide to quit the game and go to bed.

I want to say that I'm extremely disappointed, but I'm not. It's 2023 and this is all exactly what I expect of gaming these days. I was already suspicious when I got the game free with my new GPU, and my suspicions have simply been confirmed. I will probably play this for a few more hours before uninstalling completely, but if I had paid for this, I would be demanding a refund. There's no way that I can recommend it at all at its current price point.

Redfall,1294810,137675082,"In the short time that I have played, Redfall has been a legitimately boring experience. I have no desire to hop aboard a hate train for clout or to go wherever the wind is blowing, thoughts are my own.

The AI is ridiculously stupid, the world feels empty and devoid of any substance, gun-play is mediocre at best and if anything, feels stiff compared to other FPS titles I've played over the years. I don't care about any of the characters because the game right now hasn't done a good enough job of getting me to give a damn about them. I'm not expecting deep characterisation in under two hours, but I expect to want to get invested into the world & characters and nothing about it so far has been even REMOTELY compelling.

Most of my time has been spent running from bland location to bland location, looting cans of spaghetti hoops and cereal boxes that auto-convert to funds, of which I've used to buy lockpicks and re-wire tools to get mostly boring loot. The skill-tree is also uninteresting. I came across a locked door and looked around the property to see if there was a clever or interesting way to break in. Nope, turns out I can just smash the front window next to the door and climb in, then unlock the door from the inside. Maybe there are some interesting puzzle locations in the game that reward outside of the box thinking, but I hadn't found it yet. I came across a safe-house where the power generator was locked in a shed behind a locked door, I saw a small window, climbed up on something and thought maybe I could hit something to turn it on or do something to open the garage door to get in? Nah, nothing at all, unless I missed it and I'm just stupid.

Performance is also not the best. Running an RX 6600 + Ryzen 5600, I kept it on medium settings and found that the game all over the place performance wise. Sometimes it'd run smooth, then it would stutter or hitch, there was noticeable texture pop-in as well. Bugs all over the place, I've walked into locations where the enemies have no health bars and didn't even notice I was there, no reaction, shoot them and nothing happens, I had no idea whether that was a bug or feature but I assume it's the former.

AI is a comical joke, imagine being excited to finally get some in-game action, only to be met with what feels like some of the most primitive AI I've seen in modern day. They aren't particularly threatening, nor do they make me think about how to utilise the environment or skills.

I'm sorry, this needed more time in the oven. Whether it was six months to a year, doesn't matter. 

I'm glad I won this via a competition and didn't fork out £60 for it. Why waste that kind of money on modern AAA games when they're like this, when I could spend a third of that on early access games and end up with better results?

- CONS -
-----------
- Game was definitely way overhyped. (probably 95% of the negative reviewers)
- Game can strangely feel much different than the trailer leads you to believe.
- A lot of repetative gameplay that can feel rather boring and unconventional at times.
- Not Very Challenging, I have the game on Hard (Midnight) and I was expecting more of a challenge.
- The AI is pretty dumb unfortunately. You can easily hide behind stuff and kill them while looking for you.
- Framerate does drop out and lag a lot at times strangely even on lower settings that should reduce it.
- Texture Loading Issues so I put the game on Low Gfx and it still loads poorly with Textures spawning nearby.
- Menu can sometimes glitch out when trying to hover over a weapon or point of interest
- Multiplayer is limited to just friends and doesn't let anyone random join up with you or vice versa
- Game World is rather empty and barren of any life aside from Vampires and other Enemies

Get over yourselves people and get a life if you're just going to complain about everything the game has to offer. It's a different game end of story! It is very playable despite it's imperfections with a few problem areas but knowing Bethesda's and Arkane's Track Records I can imagine without a doubt that they will certainly improve and fix it over time to make it a heck of a lot better.

Redfall,1294810,137674338,"I was excited to play Redfall, I was waiting for a new open-world co-op shooter and it’s sad to say I was very disappointed. First off, this game has potential but right now at launch its buggy and I can tell with less than two hours of gameplay that the story and the content will be short. The open world is not very large, and the locations have little to search for, in one neighborhood only a couple of houses are accessible. The game is really easy even on hard, the AI either bum rushes you or just misses all of the shots while the vamps usually get stuck, rush you, or plain old leave.

Pros: 
- Location and the story idea is interesting.
- Has potential to be a good loot co-op shooter. 

Cons:
- The game is poorly optimized like most are saying. The downtown area is the worst and will go from 120 fps to 30.
- Enemy AI doesn’t track well and has only a few actions such as rushing the player or getting stuck.
- Player and NPC animations are clunky or have issues such as player mantling or climbing.
- The skill trees are small compared to many other loot- shooters.
- Resources are in abundance! I don’t know why games do this but not every house will have a super stash of the highest-level weapons and valuables. I want to struggle for gear and valuables so that I can feel pressure and get excited when I find a good weapon. 
- The shooting, moving, and aiming is clunky.

I would recommend waiting for the $70 dollar game to drop or get fixed before playing.

Redfall,1294810,137673671,"Redfall is a massive achievement in failure from Arkane Austin, the minds that were behind masterpiece immersive sim Prey.Frankly to fail this hard is equal parts negligence on all parties. Bethesda, Microsoft and Arkane. Worst of all this is a powerful idea and concept for a game! It dares to try but like a backfiring car engine instead throws soot and only exposes how ugly of a job was done on this game. I cannot see a majority of people getting a hour in on pc unless they are already big FPS fans or have friends for coop.

I have only played one character so far. The psionic, Layla. Her abilities range from being ""hey this is kinda fun"" to ""this is quite possibly the most useless thing ever"". Her shield umbrella doesn't block melee attacks in a game that has half of the enemies jump into your face to attack you. Hilariously stupid. The other half are ranged enemies that can pivot quite easily to your flank and get free damage in. WITH THE UMBRELLA UP. It is not a 180 degrees of forward protection. You cannot use weapons, heal or anything that might be remotely useful. It runs so contrary to how the enemy design is, that it's genuinely baffling. That's a lot of the game for me personally so far.

Performance is inexcusable, Arkane has done decent enough PC jobs before. Prey at least ran fairly smoothly when it was released. Same deal with dishonored although Dishonored 2 had it's problems. I have seen rainbow vomit on textures failing to LOD properly. So many framerate issues and all with DLSS enabled on performance. Simply awful.

Finally the enemy design. It's just simply terrible, the AI is so poor that there have been times i've accidentally stealthed entire missions because enemies were too dense to patrol or were patrolling and had a direct line of sight and just kept on going anyway. Same in combat.

I'm not done but i'll write a more complete review. I am severely disappointed in arkane most of all.

Redfall,1294810,137672186,"I've completed the game twice now after very casually playing through it solo and taking my time to do all the missions I could find. TLDR, I still recommend this game, flaws and all, though I think it should really only be a $40 game. I think the $70 price tag is really steep, especially for what's on offer. Regardless, if you want to know more, I'll get more in depth in the following paragraphs.

I'm probably one of a few people who like the game. This is not a hard game in any way, its really more of a casual romp through a decent open world, sometimes you get ""spooky"" things to happen, but nothing truly scary will ever hit you. Its best to view the game from the perspective of a really low budget adventure-horror movie protagonist, where the enemies are just thrown into the meat grinder that is the hero.

If I had to say anything that I truly disliked about the game, its actually the music, it jumps up at really random times, and not in an exciting or ""spooky"" way. You'll snipe a single guy and intense combat music jumps up for like 5 seconds before cutting away, kind of jarring. The game also has a rough time performance wise because as you move around the map, it has to load things in, and that typically can cause a good second or two of lag when entering a new neighborhood (zone) or if a large number of enemies spawn in due to story. If they could improve the performance of the game, that would help it drastically. I encountered a very small number of bugs, such as staking specific objectives while crouching causing me to get stuck under the environment, or occasionally being unable to crouch after leaving a Psychic Vampire Nest. Annoyances at best, nothing game ruining.

It feels like a Dead Island game but maybe a bit bigger? Cultists are the most common threat on the island, but the fun part is the Vampires. Basically just always have a shotgun on hand so you can abuse the stake attachment and you're set. My ideal loadout would probably be an automatic rifle, a shotgun, and the UV lazer for all around good coverage. The UV lazer slowly petrifies vampires, letting you instantly kill them with melee. The lazer is also pretty much necessary to deal with environmental hazards the Vampires leave in areas, which is more of a very minor inconvenience, and at some points I've actually enjoyed the challenge of dissecting a large area of all its hazards with the lazer; just wish there was a cheaper alternative, like a flashlight upgrade or something.

Staking vampires is very satisfying and I find myself occasionally picking fights with groups of vampires just because I like the staking, its very nice. You can also get equipment after a certain point in the game that grants you decent boons, one of which is ""Regain x% of health when killing a Vampire."" Its worth it to continuously bum rush Vampire Nests just to get equipment with this modifier on it, because the staking animation gives you invincibility frames, allowing you to quickly heal off the kill and then tanking hits from any other vampires in the vicinity.

The AI is definitely a bit jank for cultists but most Vampires have no issue getting right up in your face and making sure you understand why its a problem. I have beaten the game, all bosses and enemies defeated, and honest to god the only enemies that I disliked were the ""Anglers"" and the final boss. Angler's straight up just suck ass, if you got caught with an empty clip, prepare to lose a chunk of health. The Final Boss was really more of a set piece, which is a shame because I really enjoyed shooting up all the other bosses; if the developers had simply split it into phases with a real tangible health bar it would've been much cooler.

I'm almost certain that the devs fully expected people to play this with friends as opposed to alone because once or twice I got a dialogue line that was definitely meant to be played in a lobby instead of in solo mode. Wasn't a big issue honestly, more of an interesting quirk. A good number of perks in your perk tree also mention helping allies, or you might have things that mention buffing allies in a radius, so yeah definitely feels like they expected people to go in a group instead of solo. Editing this paragraph post game completion, there's literally achievements that can only be obtained by playing with others and raising ""trust"" with their characters, so yes, definitely expected people to be playing this multiplayer instead of alone.

As a final note, I'm not sure all of the characters are built equally; I picked Jacob as my Hero instead of Devinder because I wanted a more stealthy approach to combat, and originally I regretted that but I don't mind it so much anymore. A lot of Jacob's abilities sound really good if you had them fully upgraded, but upgrading them is a chore because higher level upgrades demand multiple perk points to activate; its much better to just get all the base upgrades asap on all of the abilities instead. This frustrates me a bit more than it should because it feels like I'm purposely being gate kept from playing with the upgrades I want; I suppose that I could hold off on getting cheaper upgrades to get higher level upgrades, but then I'm weaker over all for a whole 'nother level, which is a bad plan in a Dead Island style game. This really might just be a me issue though, not sure how others feel on the subject.

Back to Devinder, he has a number of abilities that just seem so much better than what most of the other characters have. The player doesn't exactly lack for firepower, so what it really comes down to is how easily you can manage a group of enemies, and I think that Devinder would probably be the best for it. The fact that one of his abilities literally just dunks a UV light ray probably makes him the best right off the bat because it absolutely destroys vampires and if I had to hazard a guess, it probably works against environmental vampire hazards which means you could carry a 3rd gun of your choice instead of having to  carry the UV lazer just in case you need it.
I'd have maybe given Layla a shot if it weren't for the fact that her abilities annoy me, and the combat Engineer looks cool but as I mentioned before, you don't need extra firepower and the AI for cultists is so jank already that there's no need to distract them. The reason I give Jacob a passing grade is because his abilities fuck even more with the enemy AI, even vampires, and his Hero ability to summon the ghost gun is really strong; it can outright kill vampires without having to stake them, even if they need a few shots to go down.

Closing statement, I enjoy the game, its definitely a different kind of game than Arkane's other stuff, I think its rather reminiscent of Dead Island with the loot, healing, weapons, and world over all. I've enjoyed my time so far, but realistically I got my enjoyment out of it at the 30 hour mark. Nests ended up being my favorite thing to do, just running in and splaffing the heart as fast as possible. I still recommend this game as I've stated before, but they need to reduce the base price significantly; there's just not enough content here to justify the $70 price tag. Again, not a reduced price via sale, but a flat reduction of the base price. $40 dollars is the honorable thing to do, $50 is the economic thing to do.",True,19,1992

Redfall,1294810,137671114,"A generic game that doesn't justify $70 cost.

Graphics are Arcane recognizable style, but while those were good in Dishonored and Deathloop here they don't fit: usual Arcane is using closed and tightly packed places and here it's and open world that feels weird with that style. Some of the assets are reused from previous games and there is no upgrade on the technical side of things.

Same as many AAA releases these days the game does not have proper PC controls and has hardcoded keys you either can't reassign altogether or reassigning them does nothing. Was it a last minute addition that no one even bothered to test? But they did bother to increase the price by $10...

Gameplay looks basic and following all the known patterns of an ""open world save the city from a plague game"": we've got survivors to rescue, camps for fast travel/ammo refill to establish, resources to grab and infinite colored loot to pick, compare and discard to pick more - it's World of Warcraft decades ago (OK, maybe traditions are not bad, but in this case better honor first the tradition of having properly assignable keys on PC). Skills are generic ""be better at the skills you're given"" type and character development seems like just going through levels and gradually acquiring all of them. There is nothing that makes the game stand out, no personality, it's more of a checklist of things to do than a classic Arcane style mystery to solve.

This review is written after two hours of playing. For an obvious reason. And I've got no incentive to go past those - because the game did not convince me it can hold anything new and interesting to play for.

I tried to play co-op with friends which just ended up wasting about 3 hours as none of us could connect to one another and when we did we faced more issues such as no sound at all from the game forcing us the restart and try all over again which we inevitably had to give up on which is extremely disappointing as the game was advertised as a amazing co-op experience.

Redfall,1294810,137670545,"Redfall, the latest release from Bethesda, is a game that falls far short of the expectations set by its predecessors. While the premise of a vampire-infested open world had great potential, the execution leaves much to be desired. It's evident that the once-revered Bethesda company is struggling to maintain its reputation for delivering high-quality gaming experiences.

One of the major shortcomings of Redfall is the technical aspect. Glitches, bugs, and performance issues plague the game, detracting from any sense of immersion. It's disheartening to see a title released with such blatant technical deficiencies, and it reflects poorly on Bethesda's commitment to delivering polished products.

The narrative, another cornerstone of Bethesda's games, lacks the depth and complexity that fans have come to expect. Redfall's storyline feels uninspired, failing to captivate players with the engaging storytelling that made previous Bethesda titles memorable. The characters are forgettable, and their interactions lack the emotional resonance that could have elevated the overall experience.

One redeeming aspect of Redfall is the visual design. The game showcases a visually appealing world, with well-crafted environments and atmospheric lighting. However, even this positive element is marred by the subpar animations and character models, further emphasizing the lack of attention to detail in the game's development.

The most disheartening aspect of Redfall is the apparent mishandling of Arkane Studios, a once highly-regarded developer. It's clear that the studio's creative prowess is being stifled, and their potential is not fully realized in this title. The lack of innovation and the recycling of gameplay mechanics from previous games indicate a stagnation in Arkane's ability to push boundaries and deliver fresh experiences.

In conclusion, Redfall is a lackluster addition to Bethesda's portfolio, showcasing a company that seems to be losing its touch. The issues plaguing the game, from technical problems to uninspired storytelling, underscore the need for a reevaluation of Bethesda's development processes. It's disheartening to witness the decline of Arkane Studios under the Bethesda umbrella, leaving fans longing for the days when both entities were synonymous with groundbreaking and captivating gaming experiences.",False,10,1121

Redfall,1294810,137669210,"I went into Redfall with little expectations, aside from it seeming like Borderlands with vampires and I was not far off. My main confusion was with the campaign and how it would progress or keep me interested being isolated to a town map. It does a decent job at keeping you on task as you roam across the city and recapture safehouses that each have their own area questlines. You fight a boss for each area after doing enough quests and pick up side quests along the way. 

The gameplay itself feels surprisingly good, each character has branching skill trees and you're constantly changing out loot for better stats or rarities. The map is littered with loot and guarded treasure, while most houses or buildings require lockpicking or hacking to enter, along with tripmines, safes, and alarms to disarm or loot. I was worried about the difficulty being too easy, but there are four modes to choose from and it's giving me a run for my money on solo hard mode. There are also lots of cosmetics to unlock just by completing quests and challenges.

My biggest gripe is that the co op was not thought out at all. Hosting a game is invite from friend's list only, which means you'll likely be playing solo unless you have friends to play with. It's annoyingly difficult to play co op at all otherwise. They need to get public servers and allow public hosting if they want co op to happen.

Overall I wouldn't jump on the hate bandwagon just yet, Redfall has potential. If you aren't bothered by pretentious FPS gripes and you enjoy looter shooters then you should pick it up, it's actually a solid game with decent challenge and detail put into it. The more you look around the more you seem to find.

(Since the developers have been unable to deliver on key features involved with the genre like multiplayer matchmaking, I can't leave a positive review so I'm changing this to negative. There WAS potential here if you focused in the right areas, but you've proven that you could not deliver.

But this, this game with the AAA price tag, launched with utter garbage optimization, woke political agenda, broken enemy AI, absurd enemy respawn and is just an average looter shooter at best.

The Dishonored character design is still there though and I love their art style, just screams Arkane when you see the models but jeez its so cringe seeing that trans reverend with the trashy getup showing off their tattoo. Millenial cosplaying as a reverend at a Halloween party on a vampire apocalypse, jesus!

Enemies respawn so quickly after you clear out a certain area when you just turn your back a few minutes and the AI is worst. They get stuck and some npcs even fall off the mesh and can shoot through walls. Even some of the dead npcs keeps talking. The performance, its annoying when the game stutters. You see those bunch of birds flying in the sky? How bout those Airdrops parachuting down? Also when you enter a different neighborhood. It even stutters when you just open the menu and sometimes during fire fights when you ADS/scope in. The game is fun when it works, the graphics are beautiful but these micro stutters even with a RTX 3080 card is taking some of it away.

In the end, it does scratch some of that looter shooter itch, you get a chance to loot high-end rarity weapons even at the early part of the game, finishing off vampires with a stake is so satisfying, the guns and character customization is a good addition but for its current price its just not worth it, wait for a sale and probably further fixes/patches.",False,12,2581

I almost refunded due to that. 

I didn't encounter any crazy bugs after the patch but the game play is just not fun! Enemies are extremely easy as everyone says. They are all bullet sponges. You think you're going to do some cool take downs or finishers? Not in this game. I absolutely love stealth! But all you can do is bash them to death! It gets very boring, very fast.

Redfall,1294810,137666941,"Leaving a tentatively positive review.

I loaded up the game for a short while to test the performance claims of other reviewers, concerned that this game might have been unplayable and result in a refund. I was pleased that the game ran flawlessly on max settings with DLAA (not DLSS) and frame generation with a completely stable 120fps@4k. GPU usage was between 57-81% & temperatures not exceeding 56 degrees.

The very minor issues I encountered were a handful of textures for the landscape took ~2 seconds to load in after rebooting the game instead of being instantaneous like the rest and there's a very brief, maybe half a second, stutter when loading areas as you move further through the map but that's not unheard of in games so I don't mind.

I always keep my system perfectly optimised for gaming and every software component updated so if you're encountering issues I'd recommend doing the same as there's more to a computer than just your graphics driver. Additionally, I've noticed a lot of reviews that are disappointed with performance are running old hardware. Try to keep your expectations realistic for how old your system is and check the system requirements, you won't always be able to play a modern game at the same resolution and quality presets that you could for one 6 years ago with the same tech.

I'll update my review as I play more with the wife in co-op later on and include any issues we might encounter but for now I've no real complaints.

Update: Co-op worked perfectly fine, no issues or bugs that prevented progression or hindered what we were working on at that time. Smooth performance persisted, never dropped below 120fps. Though after experiencing more of what the world and story had to offer I'm changing my review to not recommended as the game is for the most part quite lifeless and you'll spend more than half of your time just running through empty streets, finding a handful of enemies here and there but they never seem to be doing anything which makes them feel alive past being targets to shoot for a few minutes before you mop up their loot then continue trekking down the barren streets.

Redfall,1294810,137665713,"[url=https://linktr.ee/factorofgames] Factor of Games [/url] Steam Deck Preview Here: https://youtu.be/BxfPGb3KwEg

The game from the outset looks like Back 4 Blood for apparent reasons. There are some nice improvements, notably there is a single player component, and graphically it's a better-looking game. The real issue I have with it is that even with a Singleplayer campaign, it will live and die on the support from the CoOp audience. At $69, with many folks being let down with AAA PC releases in the past couple of months, a large portion will be holding off until substantial discounts for the game start hitting. This has me on the fence around recommending it at this point, unless you have Xbox Gamepass and just essentially play free for the next few months, then see where the Steam audience stands towards the end of summer.

Otherwise, my thoughts on the Steam Deck performance are good. It usually runs in the 40 - 50 fps range (It can dip to 30fps and climb to 60fps) and looks good on low settings with FSR 2.1. My main concern, again, is that the lack of audience will be problematic for Steam players early on. I have a poll up on my channel, and about 4% of the votes say they will buy the game on Steam. It's not 1000s of votes, but it will likely end up with hundreds of votes, and if it tracks anywhere near other new release polls I've done, it will stay in the single digits. If that holds true, it won't make me feel fantastic about paying such a high price out of the gate.

You can check out the Steam Deck footage for the game above and vote on the poll while you're there!

Main characters look like they would in any Arkane game, but other NPCs, aside from vampires, look bland, enemy cultists all look generic and friendly NPCs are missing some of that charm from their previous titles. Weapons feel punchy and fun to use, not sure how I feel about the ""rarity"" so far, as high tier weapon drops seem too common. Dynamic day/night cycle makes it really fun to roam the world and engage into different threats during the day/night. Vampires are less likely to be encountered during the day, which is precisely when cultists like to roam around. Hard to say for now but if enemy encounters are random this will work nicely as it won't get as stale so fast.

Currently my only gripe with it is the fact that idle AI really does seem broken, cultists seem to get stuck on random objects when idling/patrolling, vampire AI is fine as it doesn't physically walk unless engaging you, so they move around just fine.

This game is receiving a lot of hate, which I suppose is understandable. It is not the game we were expecting, and for being a co-op focused game, not having a matchmaking system is a huge downfall.

CONS: 
1) This game is meant to be played with co-op, although you CAN play solo. But co-op makes the game much more fun due to synergy and increased difficulty. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no matchmaking, which means playing solo, or get friends who have the game.

2) The biggest letdown is the world is beautiful, and has a very nice atmosphere, but it has so much dead space that it makes you wonder where everyone is. I think a lot of people expected a L4D2 type experience, but this is mainly an FPS with loot, and a lot of empty space.

3)Much of the game feels as though you are just looting and exploring, with battles being an afterthought. Most battles only consist of 4-6 enemies, so battles end before you even get to flex your skills, abilities, or tactics.

4) The stealth mechanics are a joke. There is no execute for backstabbing someone. It just whacks them, and if they have enough health, they will just get mad and alert someone. This game needs some serious Farycry melee executions to encourage a stealth gameplay for those who prefer it.

PROS:
1) It is not all bad though, far from it. The weapons feel fun and sound beefy, audio is great, atmosphere is great, getting swarmed by vampires can get dicey very quickly, especially on the harder difficulties.

2) Many different ways to approach enemies, though it will pretty much always come down to a firefight. But you have options on how you approach it, such as sneaking in somewhere, getting up high somewhere, running in guns-a-blazing, whatever you prefer.

3) Runs fine on my rig. Yet to have any problems outside initially crashing on launch. But that was due to a hardware issue, not the game.

4) Story so far is interesting, especially if you take the time to read the lore. Not much depth to it, but still a fun concept.

Overall, I would give this game a hard 7/10. But it has the potential to be much better than that if Arkane and Bethesda listen to players. This is going to be one of those games that needs a bunch of patches before it truly becomes the game we thought it would be.

[list]
[*] The game is bad. Enemies that don't work properly, an open world that is mostly empty, and everything is boring when it actually does work properly.
[*] The first three major bosses were actually decently fun. There aren't any bosses outside of these three, though. There are some strong enemies but they keep reusing the three or so special vampire archetypes everywhere. The last boss isn't even a boss, it's just a room filled with a few of these special enemies, and even makes them less challenging than normal [b]for the final boss[/b].
[*] Weapons suck. You keep leveling up by playing the game, and when you hit a new level suddenly all the guns that are lower level than you are become garbage. If you enjoy using a certain type of weapon, tough, because you need to find a new max rarity type of if every time you level up. You usually won't and will be stuck using level appropriate weapons that you don't enjoy.
[*] Why are weapons even candy colored with rarities? All it does it turn any gun that isn't purple or orange into trash. There are skins for weapons, too, apparently, though they're all pretty lame. I bet that if the game wasn't so poorly received they would have put good skins into an in-game shop.
[*] Way too much walking. The streets are so empty that you can tell they planned to let you use vehicles to move around during development, but just scrapped driving completely so you can hoof it through an empty world to each location.
[*] When you beat the game, it just restarts at the beginning with the same character. Maybe they thought that people would be willing to play it more than once? Who would do that? There's nothing different or new on a second play-through, there is no new game plus.
[*] I genuinely hope that everyone who owns this game on Steam also happens to have purchased a new graphics card during the promotion. Nobody deserves to have had $69.99 stolen from them for this trash.

So with lowest expectations in mind...and  a few beers in hand on a sick day...I realized it was worse than I expected. I would like to preface this by saying that for me the game performed well except for an occasional micro stutter moving between the zones, but I do have an RTX 4090 paired with a Ryzen 7 5800x3D, 32 gigs of DDR4 3600 RAM and one of the fastest PCIE 4.0 SSDs, but keeping this in mind, a game this small, this unpopulated and ugly has no business neither weighing 100 gigs on your hard drive nor giving you performance issues even if your are still running a gtx card.

In the words of Gordon Ramsey...ITS BLAND! It's got bland visuals, bland sounds, bland gameplay and bland RPG mechanics and story. A lot of this can be forgiven if gunplay was fun...but its not, I am not normally sensitive to these things but when a shotgun feels like a peeshooter you know there are issues. Enemy bodies don't respond appropriately at being shot and the guns have zero impact or kick, for nostalgia sake I tried Borderlands 1 a few days ago and it had more impactful weapons than Redfall. The RPG mechanics themselves are nothing to write home about either and loot feels inconsistent and largerly pointless as all enemies are pushovers in both stats and AI. Two of the 4 characters are also pointless, well 1 if you place co-op I imagine 2 if you play solo as one is a healer which has no purpose in solo and one is a sniper with a cloak ability and a revealing ability both of which are useless because the AI is really weak and you are might as well just run up and blast them in the face.

It does feel like the game had an ounce of vision behind it at some point, as some of the details around town are clearly inspired by the actual location and someone giving a crap about authenticity and the whole occult theme has not yet been repeated in triple A to death but a confused and troubled development has clearly impacted on what little original inspiration and vision there was...until a husk remained, that kept what little life it had by sucking the life of other better games dry...a bit sad really...",False,7,272

(I do have a top of the line PC though). 

From what I can read a lot of people must be playing the game on easy mode... Playing this on midnight (the harder of the 3 modes you can play in the beginning) I died a couple of times before leaning towards a more tactical approach. It's gotten a little easier now that I've gotten the hang of it but it's still not 'easy'. You can't expect a challenge playing on the baby mode.

[h1] From what I can gather from my play so far, I'll try to be as unbiased as I can: [/h1]
 
[b]PROS:[/b]
(+) [b]Class identity[/b]. Game gives you four different classes (more to come iirc), each one seemed unique and full of flavour. Currently playing Jacob (raven, camo) and it's been pretty solid for solo play. One of the classes I saw, I wondered why I would play that solo. Game has a passive tree system which seems nice, but some of these traits, again, why would I take them solo play. Unless I can get followers later, which I doubt. But the abilities have been fun to utilize and play with. After all who likes playing a looter shooter or RPG without class fantasy?
(+) [b]Enemy disparity[/b]. Now hear me out. As far the humans go, you have the cultists and the paramilitary. These guys carry any of the guns, and can be easy or a pain to deal with depending on how their oriented. As stated earlier I opted for a more tactical approach after I tried to brazenly open on one of these groups out (I'm in midnight mode again) and it didn't go according to my pea sized brain. The vampires have some generic ones, but then some specialty ones. Magic, watchers, these blob things (I think?) I just recently opted out of fighting for the time being, buffed ones, and I'm pretty sure in one of the missions to come that I need to unlock there's a bunch of others.
(+) [b]Cute vampire girls[/b]. What I wouldn't give to spend an eternity with the vampire woman I love... but that would be a curse in disguise if she was like the last girl I was with... let me take the stake for you my friends and tell you to choose wisely gentleman, and don't dip in crazy.
(+) [b]Visuals[/b]. Honestly, I love the graphics of the game. There are cosmetics to come/earn, there are weapon skins as well so it should just continually get better aesthetically speaking. 
(+) [b]Weapons[/b]. Although I've opted for a sniper, pistol, and shotgun for the time being, there are several choices up to the dealer. I don't know if there is one, but I haven't gotten a melee weapon and that feels amiss as even Blade himself used a sword, albeit it was a titanium blade with acid. Aesthetically speaking as I noted above, one of the shotguns I got after the beginning missions (and IDK if I was just lucky or everyone gets it) was this drenched/barnacle ghost pirate covered shotgun. And I love the way it looks, and feels to use. I've one shot one of the smaller vampires with it, but it's only level 2 and doesn't quite work on the harder enemies all the time. As I level up, it may get worse and worse, so here's hoping I keep the skin
(+) [b]Game is true to it's nature[/b]. People talking about the lack of enemies in the open world? Yea... Did you not read or pay attention to the game? This was a lovely family friendly town slowly taken over and decimated by vampires.... Why would you want to be out in the open if that was the case. Lol... Also it's daylight... And you literally watch a vampire get burned in the VERY FIRST CINEMATIC. Why do you expect there to just be vampires laying out and about sunbathing on the beach with the sun at 12'o'clock. But going into a random house, yup, found three vampires and they mauled me at the beginning. 
(+) [b]Game play has been fun so far[/b]. There have been environment interactions that I've had to use, such as lighting a battery on fire to explode a car to light some vampires and enemies on fire cause it was just the right thing to do. Staking my beloved vampires always has been fun. Abilities doing their things, stealth killing people, gunning down innocent vampires that were just trying to enjoy their day, all fun.

[b]Cons[/b]:
(-) Some of the AI do seem to be bugged sometimes. They've gotten stuck in trees, although they later moved when I got closer. There was a hecka cute vampire girl that was in one house, that was just floating around but I couldn't kill. Maybe that was on purpose, maybe I had killed her already, or she was bugged. There was a UV lamp upstairs so maybe that got her, and I didn't and that's why. But 9 times out of 10, the AI has been fine. 
(-) [b]Lose coins on death[/b]. It doesn't happen super often, but I think even Borderlands makes you pay money for dying too. Immortality ain't free bb. Not that big of a deal to me, but you know, I LOSE the coins, so obviously this is a con as a negative gain deserves a negative sign right?
(-) [b]Weapon slots[/b]. While you do get 3 weapon slots to use what you want. I've been using the sniper, pistol, and shotgun. There are those other weapons that I mentioned like a stake launcher. That seems super cool and fun to use. But I feel comfortable and safe with my 3 current weapons so why would I want to switch. But maybe I should get out of my comfort zone, go talk to that girl up at the bar or the club after all since the moment I saw her we've had 3 kids and got married and grew old and died together. But just like this made up fantasy, it only sounds good/easy on paper.
(-) Aiming. This seems a little different, but I mean it's up to the eye of the beholder. Aiming down the pistol or sniper, the cross hairs/sights don't stay still. I get this may be applicable of real life, but it feels bad missing shots because my hand eye coordination is terrible, in the game. But this is kind of up to you. Some games, the aimer doesn't sway, some does. Take your pick. 
(-) Some areas blocked off in beginning. There's a red mist that I'm assuming that hurts you, IDK cause I haven't tried. Maybe I should try, but again I lose money on death. But I wish I could go into these areas or into more but can't because of what I assume are vampire farts. I suppose a diet of ONLY human blood would turn your gas particles into red mist right? I wouldn't know, but I am an engineer so let's just say I'm right.
(-) [b]Lack of friends[/b]. If you were to play with a friend, I think you can be revived. As well as help each other out and do other stuff etc. Some of the passives help your team. But you know, with a lack of friends that play games with me I guess that's what I deserve. Not that I'm really missing out, but WHY DO I HAVE A ELDRITCH RAVEN IF IT CAN'T REVIVE ME... RIDDLE ME THAT.

All in all I think this game has been good so far and you should give into your desires and play with me. The price point DOES seem a little steep. But if money is no issue, then shoot for the stars! Although stars tend to be like the sun, so if you're a vampire, probably best to not right? Also isn't moonlight reflected sunlight? Hello plot holes... Just kidding. Is it worth $70? As far as a metric, people usually use the $1-2/hr/game right? If you play 35-70 hours of this game it should be worth it. This is quite impossible since the game just released, and I do work a 9-5 so just keep track of my hours above. This review is also coming from a huge fan and patient waiter of the 'Vampire Masquerade Bloodlines 2' game. Which will never release because the game studio is doing exactly what they did to my boy 'Titanfall 3'. They made a Battle Royale instead of developing the next best thing. Rest in peace BT.

Unfortunately, Bethesda priced this like a AAAA game, when in Reality it's much closer to an Indie game.
The gameplay seems enjoyable - i've only played the first mission so far - but for that amount of money, i expect somethings, that this game definitely does not have:

[list]
[*] amazing Graphics: this has the ""Arkane Graphics style"", but does not look any different than the Dishonored games. I'd go as far and say that from a pure Rendering standpoint, Prey had better graphics
[*] better Story/Video sequences: for 70€ (or 100, what i shelled out) i expect more than just slideshows with a single voiceover.
[*] just a bit more ""Information"" - i'm not talking tutorials, but any way to understand the gameplay, the ui,....
[/list]

These missing i can accept in a 40-50€ Game, but from the first hour of gameplay, this has less ""content/value"" than Forsaken.

Bad performance? I'm playing max settings at 5120x1440 with a 7900XTX and a 5800X3D. One member of my three-man squad is using a near 8 year old midrange rig and playing at 1440p with no issues. Another is using a 3070Ti and a 3600X at 1440p, again, with no issues. Maybe look at your crap rig before complaining. Sucks to suck.

Bad port? This shows zero signs of being a port at all, let alone being a bad one.

Bad graphics? You do realize this is this studio's art style? Have you never seen Dishonored, or Prey? Sorry but you're delusional for expecting photorealism. These aren't bad graphics by any stretch.

Coop is broken? Strange, my three-man squad experienced perfect coop. Invite sent, accepted, and away we went. If you can't coop, maybe pull a couple braincells together and troubleshoot your crap network.

The level design is not as unique, the characters seem hollow, the gun play is just ok, and the graphics look shockingly outdated for a new release, let alone a brand new IP from a AAA developer. Both Deathloop, DH2 and even Prey look much better than Redfall.

The single player is the main focus and the multiplayer is basically rendered to an after thought in some aspects because they do nothing to encourage it. This is very sad considering the trailers and demo game play make it look like the next big coop multiplayer game like Left 4 Dead. Additionally the AI is ridiculously dumb for a AAA game. I mean stupid dumb... I cant believe they let it pass like this. The AI basically is super predictable, runs at you just to be shot. The vampire AI is slightly better but I almost feel like they dumbed down the humans so much to make the Vampires seem more challenging. The Vampires are basically the same situation but a bit more tanky. They run at you, jump at you, and warp around you. They are very easy to predict.

Redfall,1294810,137661697,"So I was in love with the cinematics and the gameplay provided here and in youtube intrigued me.


So I decided to bite the bullet, play a bit and hopefully put some gameplays on my youtube channel.

The moment I launched I was greeted with 3 consecutive crashes.
The irony? the ""send report and restart"" did not even work.
The application was still alive in the background and I had to kill all the 3 copies by hand.
Strangely, the 4th time It ran normally.
then you get greeted by one of the largest annoyances you could find.
A DAMN INTERNAL LOGIN SYSTEM... 

PERFORMANCE:
There is some sort of weird jitter/stuttering issue with this game..
RivaTunner/MSIafterburner with a 4090 RTX had this very constant ""spike"".
The spike was not that large but you could see the jitter when you moved sideways.
Very similar of the deformation you see when DLSS3 was turned on.
Running natively (4k, epic quality)  alleviated the issues a bit. But was still there.
Some people mentioned this is because the engine used? (Unity) and many games needed patches to fix this.
Why then in 2023... after so many years fixing and experiencing these issues... the games still have it when using this engine? No idea.

Gameplay wise:

Think of this like a mixture between Borderlands and Left4dead.
The bad? there are loot mechanics.. That means you could crap your pants at first and get a legendary.
But as time goes by. Enemies boost in power and you will need to ditch your precious legendaries for weapons of higher level but with worse rarity ( you have level and rarity variations).
You also get special powers, 3 of them... for each character. 1 basic, 2 medium and an ultimate.
There is also a leveling system that improves these skills based in a branch system. 


So far I noticed the weapon has plenty of weapon classes with subclasses.
Example, shotgun has pump, double, and auto.

Weapon classes are pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, UV weapon,  flaregun, stake launcher, sniper rifle.
Certain weapons are better against humans while others decimate vampires.
So weapon wise, theres plenty to experiment.  Plus some skins of the legendary weapons are great. 

The bad about weapons: Your ammo is mostly limited, specially the strong ones like sniper rifle.
Sniper aim plus the weird inputlag/jitter  affects how the shots register. trajectory also does not follow the scope.
So you might think you're going to shot an enemy in cover, but you end hitting the cover instead (yes, when zoomed in).
So I ended missing a lot of easy shots and ended running out of ammo.

The worst? almost all ammo is for shotgun and pistols in my gameplay so far.

Enemies: Enemies are... well.. very generic.
You get the humans of 2 factions that fight AGAINST you.
Then you have some ones with ""powerups"". These are the classic pistol, shotgun, assault rifle and sniper variants.
Then you have vampires.

Ironically I ended dying more by traps (laser trip mines) and environmental damage (the same explosion of the trip mines triggered electrical damage nearby..) than dying by enemies.

The map is very detailed and pretty decent in size. Almost looks like a real town.
The bad.. enemies appear randomly (you can see them on the horizon spawning as you approach). Only certain zones have predefined enemies for quests or setting up safe houses).

Gameplay wise: While the game feels a bit clunky, it is varied and effective.
Still no way nearby gems like Prey, Borderlands or Bioshock.
Infact, the videos shown by the publisher related to gameplay.. looked enhanced as crap compared to what you get in reality.
Lore and Story papers are scattered around. It's decent so far I guess.

The most annoying stuff: YOU CAN GET STUCK IN SO MANY PLACES AND YOU HAVE TO RELOAD!

To resume: Not worth it if you get bored easily with loot mechanics and ""go here do this"" kind of missions.
And def not worth 70$ and the deluxe season pass versions completely not worth the money.

Expensive, and jank, but its the mood and the experience I want right now.

It is not very pretty, it feels very un-optimized and messy. I had a few crashes, went and updated drivers, turned down a few settings and we still had some major slow down and lag, but it did work.

While the game definitely needs fixing, I think there's SO SO much potential here for something great, and I already think it's pretty great.

It has that Arkane feel I look for when I'm playing an Arkane game. 

That being said, when I'm playing solo those issues listed are my only ones. Co-op is a different story however, and I found it to be very buggy.  Some crashes here and there (about 3-4 during 3-4 hour session with a full squad) but we still had FUN we're all laughing and running around murdering cultists and vampires.

Redfall,1294810,137660945,"I can see where the negative reviews are coming from, though looking at the forums the last few days, it seems a lot of people went into the game ready to hate it (somewhat evidenced by the number of reviews with less than an hour). The price tag is high, and the game launched with some glaring issues. That said, even the worst issue I found (graphical issue with sniper scope sometimes) was not at all game-breaking, and will almost certainly be addressed in the week 1 patch.

I personally did not suffer any major performance issues, my game ran between 53-60 fps for the majority of my playtime, though I did drop to around 40 in the theatre. (RTX 2060, ryzen 5 3600, 32gb, medium settings, 2560x1440).

In terms of the actual gameplay, the different enemies so far have been pretty unique, with some having some very cool mechanics I hadn't seen before in other games. The gunplay was entertaining, and the character I played had some fun abilities. I can't comment on the other characters as I haven't tried them, but Layla's elevator made for some awesome plays in co-op. Exploration is also rewarded with items and collectibles, which is nice.

It's hard to go into more depth with just a couple of hours played, but I'm looking forward to seeing more from this title.

My advice would be to take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. While I truly hate this trend of games being released with obvious bugs, at least in my case, I didn't encounter anything major. Co-op worked perfectly for me, with one friend on steam and another on gamepass, and as mentioned, even with my pretty average setup the game ran smoothly with only relatively minor drops in one area.

$70 is IMO pretty expensive for a game, so maybe wait for the week 1 patch and see what folks are saying then (or just try it out on gamepass). In my case, I've had fun with it so far and am excited for more laughs in co-op.",True,155,428
Redfall,1294810,137660881,"So a note of as much constructive criticism to the developers as I can give

I was really excited for this game. I was unfortunately heavily disappointed. .

The game is extremely easy to the point of boredom, even on the highest difficulty.

Every house has 5-10 guns in it, with the player able to obtain purple loot in less than an hour (on the highest difficulty setting). 

I found myself trying to create my own challenge by only playing the entire game... multiple hours in, with a pistol and was still almost instantly killing every enemy I came into contact with. 

It just needs a lot of balancing. But it needs more than that...

There is all of this cool loot all over the map... but it serves no function and instantly gets translated into cash... I would almost be more satisfied if (like borderlands... / honestly the closest game experience to this game.. except much better) you just replaced all of that loot with actual cash and made all of those loot models decorative. 

Also if you play with a friend the loot the 2 of you receive is different but there is no way (that we could figure out after hours) to trade or drop guns or loot... only to turn those guns...you guessed it.. into more space bucks or blood dollars or whatever they are. 

I am not trying to just tear this game down... I truly hope the devs are able to rebuild what they have here into a playable experience but this is NOT worth 70$

This is like a well put together early access game at best

Sorry folks but honestly the price is just irritating with this level of quality. 

I am surprised Bethesda let this ship in the state that it is in with their name on it

Game runs okay, didn't notice any crazy frame drops in the last two play sessions, so they must have patched it to run better??? Leveled up to 20 of 40, and the game lets you NG+ into the harder difficulty to play more.

Redfall,1294810,137659756,"This is the first Arkane game that I don't enjoy.

Despite the difference in genre from most Arkane titles, I was excited. The trailers made this game look fun. Despite the difference in genre, I'd like to point to how good Prey 2017 was (despite the low sales and poor ending) and what [i]could have been[/i] for Arkane Austin's Redfall...

[b]Redfall's open world is empty, and the enemies that populate it are hilariously dumb.[/b] Let me touch on both:

I think a good way to describe the open world is with an example. On the north-east side of town, there's a house you can actually enter. It's a normal house, furnished although a large amount of empty space in it. In the backyard, there's a large shed that you can also enter. For about 50 meters around the shed, there is nothing but flat, freshly cut grass. No bushes, flowers, nothing. And inside this large shed? Nothing. An empty, fully textured shed with a pool leaning up against the wall.
[b]The world feels like it's too big for itself, and yet in 3 hours I had been around half of the whole town.[/b] I noticed that a truck with cultists had spawned and the disappeared later on, meaning that the empty space is supposed to be filled with things that can change. Which would be neat, if it happened more than once...

Now, I had seen the pre-release footage. I knew enemies ran towards you instead of shooting in an open space. I was hoping that the harder difficulty would make them less dumb, but all the difficulty seems to do is boost the damage done. Now I was also thinking ""oh it's an Arkane game, they're meant to be dumb so that I can find fun ways to kill them!"" There are so few ways to go about doing that: guns, and your abilities that do pitiful amounts of damage. No throwable props, no stealth take-downs/back-stabs, and environmental damage props maybe every 200 meters.
I also came to notice that groups of enemies would spawn behind me quite often. Anywhere I wasn't looking, in the heat of battle, enemies would spawn in a room I had just cleared. I actually saw them spawn at one point. Maybe I had whipped around too fast or something? 

Despite being a different Arkane studio, it's worth making the comparison. DEATHLOOP, despite it's arguably worse optimisation, is a better game. It even shares some of the same RPG gimmicks as Redfall. I wanted to love Redfall, and I want Arkane to prove me wrong and make me buy this again in the future once they do something with it. Given Bethesda's track record of dropping things that don't sell well (they did it to Prey 2017 and DEATHLOOP), I don't see that happening.

Sitting at $101.69 CAD, I cannot in good faith recommend Redfall at all, and during writing this I have been given a refund.

The open world of the game is empty and dead outside of random vamp encounters or the stray cult member who got lost.

Love the vampire slaying, love the characters + their abilities. It's very much an Arkane take on Borderlands + Far Cry with the open world hero looty shooty concept. However, for an island that is supposedly overrun by vampires + cultists, it's empty. Enemies are dumb and don't detect you even after you shoot at them a couple times (tried to headshot a cultist and missed THREE times before they became aware). Vampires are better enemies but still too easy to defeat. Loot is very inconsistent in the sense that you find ""epic"" and ""legendary"" items VERY early and VERY often. In one instance I opened a bag that gave me three snipers, each a different tier. I'm not gonna complain about good loot (hehe) but if I'm always gonna find legendary items, there just doesn't seem to be a need for the tier system, if that makes sense.

You would think that after Cyberpunk 2077's controversial release that all game devs would know what NOT to do (release an unfinished game) but some lessons don't stick even in 2023. This game is buggy, glitchy, runs poorly........... it's  U N F I N I S H E D. I'm not the type to let performance make or break a game for me too much, as long as everything else is really enjoyable, but that's not what's happening here. I would rather devs delay the game until it's great then release it half baked.

Also, what's the point of co-op if mission progress isn't shared? To ME, that's zero incentive to even try it out. Might just be a ""me"" thing though, idk.

Redfall has an interesting style to it I find attractive in a weird sort of way.  It looks nice, and plays smooth.  The story telling is decent and keeps up with the look and feel of the game.  The way it's presented is somewhat comic book style (at least for me to this point), or story book/picture book, but its decent and cool.

Radeon RX 7900XT
Ryzen 9 7900X 12 Core
64G of DDR 5 Ram
Samsung SSD
5120x14400 resolution on a 46 inch ultra wide Samsung Monitor.

I've finished the first mission, killed my first vamp, and saved the fire station along with everything that goes with that (Don't wanna ruin too much).  It was a bit slower paced, because I chose to be a bit more... slow and stealthy because I wasn't sure what to expect quite yet.   However, the first mission was very good and well paced, and allowed for a great tutorial to this point.

All the while, the Radeon software says 113 FPS.  It's crisp, clean and responsive.  So, I am not sure what people are talking about when it comes to the game being a slide show... Maybe they are playing on crap connections in coop or MP, I can't speak to that, but for the purpose I bough the game for,  a single story vamp killing game, it runs GREAT maxed out.

Yes, there are a few odd glitches and bugs here and there. I am playing as Remi, because she can heal (I'm told, at some point... :P), and right now here little Robot pet doesn't really keep up all that well.  He needs much better pathing.

Other than that, I can't say much else, I am only 1.2 hours in, but if it keeps up this way, the purchase was well worth it.

I tried to give it a chance. I played the whole time with 2 friends, and we just steamrolled through everything we did, and after every quest, I was just so disinterested. Some of the abilities are kind of cool on paper, but there is no purpose to using any of them because the enemies, as sparse as they are, just let you beat them around. I came in expecting some action-packed, vampire-slaying fun, and what I got was a glorified walking simulator with the occasional combat encounter that boiled down to me shooting an enemy once with a sniper and moving on.

Redfall,1294810,137658398,"A fun game despite the FPS and Minor Graphical issues. Though I don't think it's worth the $70. $70 would have been the optimal price for the Deluxe Edition, but not the base game.

First off it isn't really how they made the marketing seem like it was. This is a Single Player game that happens to have Coop. This is not a Coop Vampire shooter like we were made to believe.

As an open-world co-op shooter, Redfall is a refreshing entry into the genre that more or less hits all the right notes. Arkane’s remarkable knack for art direction is ever present throughout the vampire ranks, with out-of-proportion hands, shiny trench coats and gnarled expressions bringing the fear factor when they’re up close. Siphons drain your life force, Shrouds cover the arena in darkness, and Anglers can hook you towards them for a deadly uninterruptible blow. This all comes together to create a superb setting, where you get to explore the pithy backstories of each Vampire God before you face them, seeking out guilt-ridden remnants of their past to expose vulnerabilities.

What really hurts Redfall the most is the dismal shape it’s in. Stuttering and sharp dips in the framerate are just the beginning here. Graphical anomalies are pretty much constant, with textures failing to load and shadows flickering. After some updates however, Redfall will become another Arkane gem. I just wish they would have made the price more reasonable because as is the $70 price tag is going to deter a lot of people from playing the game until one of Steams many discounts.

Pros
-------
- Vampires are done gruesomely well
- Engaging ability-based combat with room to specialise
- An inspired setting with a thick, immersive, open-world atmosphere
- A fun story with plenty to say
- Plenty to do with your friends in co-op

Cons
-------
- The focus on action can get in the way of narrative nuance
- Arkane’s strengths struggle to shine through

Looks like it's going to be a pretty straightforward looter shooter. Skill trees look moderately promising but nothing so wild that I'm worried about brokenness.
In short: if you've got buddies that are wanting to play? It's a platform to co-op game a bit.
If you're just looking for solo... this might be too vanilla to be worth the AAA price tag at release.

Redfall,1294810,137658257,"FIRST IMPRESSIONS 

This is one of those games that needs a meh option. Before the review let me talk about performance:
Spec - RTX3080ti, 32 Ram, i912900K

With these specs I had no real issues with the game. I understand that some people are having worse issues than that, but it is definitely NOT ""one of the worst PC launches ever"" that is becoming a mantra now. Last of Us and Jedi Survivor are CLEARLY much more broken launches, so let's not call everything the worst ever.

The only real performance issue for me was that It seams that when you move into a new area, sometimes you get a slight pause, but I don't think that is graphics performance issue; I think it is an always on-line loading assets issue like the Diablo 4 beta had and it is a very uncommon occurrence.

I played through one neighborhood so far taking it slow and wandering as much as trying to do a mission. So far here are the ups and downs.

UPS
+ Atmosphere is creepy, but not scary
+ The game feels like a town and the aesthetic is overall good.
+ Weapons are solid and feel punchy. Despite what I have seen some others say, there are definitely several styles of weapon to play with from your basic shotgun, sniper, and handgun (I have yet to see an assault rifle) to the more specific purpose stake shooters, uv guns and flare guns.
+ Weapon levels and quality both are very impactful. Weapon damage seems more level dependent and special modifier quantities are defined by rarity.
+ Exploration is rewarded with lots of different things from rare guns to cosmetics.
+ There is mob diversity so some fights could be interesting, but see below.
+ No inventory concerns. You are frequently picking up items that the civilians can use at hubs and safe houses, but they instantly get converted to cash. So, the only thing you store is guns and even they can be instantly turned into cash.

DOWNS
- The world is too empty. There are too few roaming mobs so far and I have gone through a few buildings now that had only 3-6 mobs in them and one that had NONE. Perhaps this is how they intended to curb the difficulty for single player. But more would definitely be better.
- The AI on most mobs is terrible. I was jumped by a pack of 4 vampires at close range. I should have been dead as I was just starting with mostly crappy weapons, but I killed them because half of them just stood there and they were getting in each others way as they just rushed me.
- Small but significant bugs. That may sound contradictory, but what I mean is that there are glaring bugs that don't break the game in any way. There was one house where a vampire seemed to have gotten stuck in the ceiling and just stood there unavailable but not doing anything. In another place, I opened a chest and it displayed nothing, but then I shut it and walked away. When I came back, it was full of stuff. Things like that.
- Odd immersive element choices, there are things that are just... odd and disconnected feeling about the game. You are picking up everything from rope to toilet paper for your survivors, but not aspirin or many other obvious and small essentials laying around. You also don't pick up food for them. Food is for small heals. You would think that, if you are full on health and you pick up a food item it would just cash itself for the community but it doesn't. So, I guess you are supposed to just leave it there? There was another place where there was a big deal made about a furnace in the basement and when I got to the place that allowed me to unlock the furnace... nothing happened and nothing was in there.
- The graphics, while not terrible are very average and enemy motions are stilted and awkward. Even with fast vampires they are not liquid and menacing. They are marionettes with invisible strings. The cultists move more naturally, but they are pretty brain dead so they seem more like zombies in very small quantities.

I would say that this game is pretty half baked, but that would not be fair as it is playable and there was only a bug or two that I saw. The main problem seems to be more design oriented than being launched to early.",True,5,858

My 4070 TI / 13900K / ddr5 / samsung 990 pro nvme4 / windows 11 hit's 120 native 1440 with ultra settings. But the stuttering is very real. Regular / random but not constant drops to as low as 6 FPS, and frame times jumping from 18-25 to 40-50+ that I saw when I looked over. Not often enough to make it unplayable, but enough to be annoying and impossible to ignore.

AI needs work. No matchmaking or looking for group in the system which should be standard for this game, if not righyfully required, QoL improvment.

Item levels and quality's are not intuitive to differentiate. I can look through them all and figure it out. But the levels don't change colors but matter more than quality which does stand out.. You could make it easier. 

I'll keep playing. Hope it improves. I'll try to find people to play with on the xbox find groups overlay. Or maybe try to find a discord.

You can pick up LOOTABLE items about 1/10 times because the interaction box is on the moon for some reason. Enemies will spawn on top of you, in rooms or areas you JUST CLEARED (sometimes areas that already had enemies in them), the ""difficulty"" is that some enemies take about 1,000+ bullets to kill and the game will spawn 50+ enemies on top of you and no matter how good you are (due to the controls being worse than playing COD on the Wii) you will die, and the story is, from what I gathered, about vampires (who I believe are standins for the devs) are killing people for some reason.

The game runs great on my 2080Ti, i9-9900K, 32Gb DDR4 PC. So far the game runs at a perfect 60fps at 4K High Settings on the AMD FSR set to Quality with the Sharpness at 0.5. 

Remember I'm on Single Player and have NOT tried Coop yet. (insert jokes about not having friends here). The game has one particular moment that tanks the game to 15-25FPS. Its right in the beginning when those helicopters crash as you exit the Fire Station. Whenever I look at the smoke from the helicopter crashes the frame rate tanks. But once that smoke plume was out of sight the game went back to 60fps. Im not an expert but its definitely something effy from the fire effects from the helicopter crash. Which I tested when I got close to the wreckage. Once I did that mission and got to the the fire, it seemed to have dissipated and then looking at the smoke no longer tanked my frame rate. Once I did that mission the frame rate no longer tanked.

There are also FPS drops when there are particle effects such as explosions and when staking a vampire.

For a laugh I increased the settings to high and ultra to see how bad the performance would be. I was getting a max of 50 FPS on high and on ultra it was a slideshow with FPS in the single digits most of the time. 

The combat is also lackluster. The non vampire enemies will stand there and let you mow them down or run at you in a straight line or get stuck on objects. Vampires are not much better as they too can get stuck on objects.

Redfall,1294810,137657010,"My rating: 4/10

* After playing for just 1 hour and 37 minutes, I feel like I've already experienced everything the game has to offer, which is disappointing. The Dishonored series, which shares similarities with this game, offered major plot twists and a compelling story that kept me engaged, always eager to uncover more. Unfortunately, this game lacks those narrative hooks and fails to reveal any grand scope of the situation you're in.

The core gameplay's biggest issue is the AI, which poses little to no challenge. It's often possible to take out entire squads with unsuppressed gunfire before they even notice. If they do detect you, they simply switch to 'search' mode. On the rare occasions when they do notice you, their reactions are predictable—they either make a beeline for your position or stand in the open, making headshots trivially easy.

I've also encountered several bugs, including terrain holes that lead to a white abyss, sinks that pour water through the sides of basins, and overlapping HUD keybind icons. These issues disrupt the gameplay experience and immersion.

Moreover, the lack of Quality of Life (QoL) features is astonishing for a game that's supposed to be Co-Op based. It offers limited graphical options and lacks basic settings like adjustable aimed sensitivity, which is crucial for a game centered around shooting vampires and cultists. Additionally, the absence of proper stealth kill and healing animations further breaks the immersion.

It's surprising and disappointing that a game from a well-known development studio was released in this state in 2023. Unfortunately, this seems to be becoming a distressing norm in the industry.

Redfall,1294810,137656712,"So far the game is a blast but a flawed one at that. A bit of a looter shooter shoved into a well crafted world ripe for exploration, both narrative and mechanical. The art team did a great job really bringing locations to life and the sfx and music work ties in to create this wonderfully pulpy setting. Currently playing solo but I am deeply enjoying the writing for Devin, the Cryptid hunter, it's smart and witty with just the right amount of b movie cheese. 

There is quite a bit of jank with the AI that is undoubtedly holding back the combat which otherwise has some serious potential. Ex. As I pushed to the main theater I decided to deploy my relocator to a nearby roof. I then engaged with my shock staff and took out the first 2 of 5 targets. Popped my re locator and from the rooftop used my sniper rifle to take out the remaining targets, two of which I killed by shooting an nearby explosive barrel. Problem is the AI mostly just stand about as I pick them off even on Nightmare difficulty and while the Vamps have some interesting attacks and powers they get stuck on doorways, walls and generally struggle to be a threat as consistently as they should.

The game is also lacking as a pc port and I would also love to see some additional options here on PC for stuff like ADS sensitivity and HUD elements. All in all it feels like an ambitious project that didn't quite come together but I am nonetheless having fun with. If I had to give it a score now I would say a 6/10 and if Arkane can fix up the AI and port issues that would quickly become a 7/10. Not a flawless gem but a fun romp with plenty of those classic Arkane set pieces through a wonderfully atmospheric setting.

It's likely to be a discounted pickup for most folks but if you can wrangle together even just one other friend to play in co-op when that faithful bargain bin pickup day comes you'll hopefully find a slightly more polished game, several patches in and you'll def get some fun out of it.",True,6,940

Redfall,1294810,137656621,"For a studio like Arkane with a host of classics behind them like Arx Fatalis, Dishonored 1+2 and Prey. To have made something like Redfall, something must have seriously gone wrong.

I've been playing on the midnight difficulty, which is the hardest difficulty you can play on without having previously completed the game, and there hasn't been a single enemy thus far, from vampires, cultists, cultist lieutenants to Belwether soldiers and officers, that I haven't been able to avoid by simply running around them in circles. The AI is almost non existent.
At one point I was fighting three vampires at once, and while they were lurching and clawing at me, I simply stepped to the side, and nothing happened. I could take my time and whittle them down with my level 1 gun and then finish them with my level 1 stake equipped shotgun.

I will play a bit more though, get a few more levels to make sure the AI isn't being artificially restricted due to some kind of level scaling, but I doubt it, I will edit the review if that's the case.

Then there's the performance, I happen to play with a 4090 and so the performance is generally acceptable at around 140-160 FPS, however this is with DLSS 3 frame-generation. Without that, I get 30-40 FPS at 4k with a 4090. So essentially if you do not have the latest hardware and are playing at high resolution, do not even bother trying.

The game world feels exactly the same as Fallout 76. You get nonsense missions from npc's that could just as well be non existent. And you loot junk in the open world. There are many buildings, but most of them cannot be entered.

At this point, If I had to bet, they're going to take the wrong lesson from reviews such as this.
Instead of improving the AI, they're going to turn the enemies into bullet sponges, prolonging the fights, instead of making them interesting, they're just going to become even more annoying. And instead of improving the scrap looting, they're just going to make it worth less, so you have to loot even more to get the same amount of currency.

If you think about it Fallout 76 came out in 2017, that's 5-6 years ago. It wouldn't be far fetched to think that Arkane played that, enjoyed it, and figured they could make something similar. Which they have done.

Redfall,1294810,137656566,"Overall gameplay is ok. It's clearly a game made for co-op, more like Dying Light than Dishonored.
It's nothing special, and it doesn't stand up to Arkane's previous work, but I've personally had fun so far.

I understand that £60/$70 is a lot of money compared to other games - If you're looking to get value out of your money in a game, this probably isn't the game for it. But compared to other media you can get? It's worth $70.

Lots of nice little details, good graphics, slappy music and yes, kind of bad AI.

A lot of people have complained about performance, but I've found the performance to be acceptable. Max settings, coasting around 70-80fps with occasional dips towards 60 and occasional jumps up to over a hundred. The performance could do with improvement, but compared to something like Jedi: Survivor? It practically runs like butter. (CPU	Ryzen 5 5600X GPU			 Radeon	RX6800, which i believe are very slightly below their recommended specs for ultra)

Again, don't get me wrong, this game is far from perfect and could be improved, but I think all the negative reviews I've seen are being a little too harsh, the game is alright. If it wasn't $70, I'd call the negativity completely unwarranted, but I think it's fair to criticise the game as compared to a many other games on steam, it isn't worth the money.

There's a lot to explore in the area so can easily get distracted with what you're doing to run to another area to explore. The animations look nice when reloading a weapon or staking the vampires. It is a vampire apocolypse.. so I wouldn't listen to any other negative reviews that are going around. The game is fun. I don't know what type of game people expect to be ""mind blowing"" but I don't think they know how to have fun when playing a game either. They are the reason why we can't have unique games today that are purely different so instead we get the same type of shoorters ...because of everyone trying to find something wrong with the game.

AI Is pretty busted, a lot of the time the vampires can't even get down from house roofs. 
Close combat feels super clunky because there's no ""dodge"" button In the game, so you're stuck running In a circle around the enemies waiting for them to take a swing and miss to then continue attacking.

Optimization Is just non-existent, like I cannot believe this got the green light atleast for the PC version.

Textures pop In and out. Now this Is something that gets on my nerves really quick In games, If you got textures popping In and out because you tried limiting the stress on peoples computers by not rendering things a set distance away from the player that's all fine. Lots of big games stop rendering things that the player can't see anyways, but we got an Issue when you're not rendering things the player CAN see and STILL lag optimization. It's just a disaster honestly.

Gunplay Is fine.

The Eagle dude Is semi okay too, that's the only one I've played so far.

Skill tree Is fine, no Issues there. 

Map Is terrible, I get the artstyle they went for that's fine and all. But the map could reaaally use some love on the Information side, It feels way too bland and just empty. 


Settings could use some looking too. Why does controls under settings not an an option to scale the ADS sensitivity?. 
Game has no fps limiter besides Vsync.


Loot that you can find In the world has NO Indicator whether It can be picked up or not until you mouse over It, this means you have to mouse over everything to find out whether It can be picked up a not. Looking at the artstyle I think It'd have been perfect to have a small white'ish border around Items that's Interactable, this would save so much time and headache. 


Overall for the 70/90$ I gave for this game I would have guessed a lot of the above would have been the most basic things to have In check before release, I cannot recommend the game at all In Its current state.

I have no idea what to expect from this game. The negative reviews claiming that the game runs poorly are from machines running the current top gen crap like 4090s bundled together, which don't get as much support as 3080s and lesser. You got screwed.  

The AI is terrible, and the game as a whole lacks a solid foundation for the open world concept. I turned the difficulty up to max and walked up to punch everyone in the face while they shot above my head. 

The characters movements and the key binds feel terrible, there are already good ways to set default keys to something like punch on G or Q or V or C, why is F punch? It's usually interact or flashlight. While T is now flashlight? 

They took no direction in any of these areas, attempting to build any kind of solid foundation that would allow their game to stand on its own. The game is functional, but a game like Atomic Heart trumps this by a mile and that game was a shit show.

There is no matchmaking for co-op, it's plagued with crashes, numerous bugs, and very noticeable frame drops. All in all, it's just not worth it.
I can see it everywhere; this game doesn't seem to have been developed with care. Assets are floating in the air, and so on.
Charging 70 to 100 EUR for this game is just insane and feels insulting.

There are issues with co op and seeing the friendly models, issues with ammo displaying incorrectly, issues with enemy AI and easily being to get them stuck forever or not even notice you, issues with missions being stuck and needing to restart them to progress, issues where nests (instances) have the final door bugged where you can't leave until the timer runs out so you lose out on ""escape"" experience, issues with co op balance where the game thinks your friendly is level 1 but the host retains the much higher level and 1 shots everything, and so so much more including still awful frames at the lowest settings dipping down to 7-12 FPS with a GTX 1080.

Feels like a mash up of Vampire the Masquerade and Fortnite (loot without the building).  Definitely looks like an Arkane game.  Feels like one too.  Gameplay-wise, It seems OK.  I went into this not know a thing about it.  And, quite honestly, I still am not sure what this is trying to be.  Basically, you roam around a city killing some fanatics during the day and then vampires during the night, all the while collecting loot (guns mostly) and completing quests and side missions.  Each character has a skill tree as well, though I haven't explored it yet. The game is pretty easy without upgrading with the enemy AI being pretty brain dead and the maps being somewhat barren.  I'd recommend you crank up the difficulty for a slight challenge.

Seems like people are complaining about performance.

I'm playing at 1440p; 7800x3d, 7900 xtx, 32GB DDR 6000 @ Ultra.  Runs decent with highs at 145 and lows around 100 FPS.  No upscaling.  There is some minor, but very infrequent stutter present.

Always disable motion blur.
The game loads ultra fast; Less than 15 seconds to get in game after launch.

Redfall is an OK romp.  Though, ironically, it's kind of lifeless.  It's not bad, per se, it's just not great.  Is is worth picking up?  Sure.  For $70.  That's debatable.  I haven't tried co-op, so maybe that's where it's at.",True,7,112

First and foremost, I acknowledge there are many issues with this game, however, I do consider it a gem in the rough and don't think MANY of the criticisms would matter or be as blown up (graphics quality, arts style, etc) if some of the bigger issues (enemy AI, always online, empty world, 30fps on consoles, etc) were addressed.  In other words, I feel the entire game is under a microscope right now and many of the criticisms people hear about should only be taken with a grain of salt, because many of those same criticisms could easily be applied to other games, but arent, because of the glaringly obvious issues with Redfall.  Hope that makes sense.  That being said, I'm enjoying the game!  I really enjoy the artistic style of the game - it's lighthearted and cartoony and it works!  The gunplay is really good and is much better than most give it credit for in my opinion. Vampire deaths absolutely rock!   

A couple things I think the game needs to work on...  Enemy AI really is bad and I echo the sentiment of the community on this one.  They aren't tactical at all, don't use cover, and are basically just fodder.  I also think hit boxes need to be looked at - it feels really inconsistent at times.  Also, the world does need some work imo, because it does feel empty.  Ive only played solo so far, so I can only imagine how empty it feels running around in a group.

I have nothing clever to say.  I bought and tried this game, and immediately refunded it.  I then tried to overcome my hang ups with the games performance in order to experience the games mechanics by subscribing to Game Pass for one month.  I spent another 4 hours or so trying to push my way through the main story and quests and ultimately I just could not find any enjoyment or satisfaction in this game.

If the performance issues were resolved, and the AI was tuned/balanced better, this game could become serviceable, but it will never be fun for me... and I will likely never play it again.  I don't see myself buying a copy... If anything, I'll just subscribe to Game Pass for another month if I really feel the need to test these waters again.

I would advise against buying this game, and instead... play it via Game Pass or just give it a skip.

New 2024 review:

Update: Got it on a deep sale.  Yup.  Three patches later, the performance and AI was improved, and the game is now serviceable, but still unfun.  Still... for $18, it's hard to pass up, if for no other reason than morbid curiosity.  The game world is very pretty... but everything else is just as DOA now, as it was at launch.

Update 2: Well, that's all folks.  Arkane Austin has been shut down as of 5/7/2024.  We all got scammed out of DLC and deluxe edition content, fed false promises, and probably will never see our money back.  I wonder how many people will casually forget this tragedy, and buy an Xbox, or whatever live service trash Xbox slings at them in the coming years.

Update 3: They released the final update with offline mode and major game improvements.  I would argue the game is now fun.  It's clear that if the version of the game we have now was the version released at launch, the game would have likely seen more success.  More proof that management is/was to blame for 90% of Redfall's failures.  Hopefully Xbox/ZeniMax was able to see that there is talent to be retained from Arkane Austin, and simply fired management... but I doubt it.",True,0,1938

REDFALL is a joke. The PC port is unstable as all hell. I have played for almost 2 hours as of writing this review and below I will state EVERYTHING wrong with the game.

[h1][b] What is wrong with the game [/b][/h1] 
⚫So to start it off, it stutters. Not BAD bad but... its is unmissable. You can be running around just looting and then SMACK, your frames drop and the stutter hits you hard. 
⚫The AI in the game are the most stupidest enemies I have EVER seen in my life. I can hold in S and A and dodge EVERY single attack from a vampire.
⚫The stealth... come on.... you have blood in your body... vampires can smell blood... stealth should not be a thing against vampires... right? or is this just me being petty...
⚫The game looks like PLAYDOUGH. On max settings, medium settings and low settings. It all looks like UTTER GARBAGE.
⚫The ""cutscenes"" are not actual ""video-scenes"". It is a picture with AUDIO coming through. Didn't REDFALL get delayed? So what is with the state of this????
⚫The gunplay feels off. Its slow, clunky and just a mess. The weapons feel like they have way to much weight to them to actually be good in a fight. Most enemies just stand there and shout out at you and you see their glint of when they go to fire at you.... how pathetically lazy.
⚫Online Co-op, Cross-platform Multiplayer but no matchmaking. WHY? SERIOUSLY, WHY.
⚫The animations are terrible also. When you go to ""stake"" a vampire, you will completely miss it and stake mid air but still kill the vampire. 
⚫ANOTHER thing with the AI is that they are terribly coded. They get stuck on EVERYTHING. I was doing the tutorial mission in the firehouse and my vampire was stuck in the bloody floor.... it was just standing there letting me kill it and when I went to stake it, it glitched into the floor so the ""F"" prompt did not show and It regenerated FULL HP. 

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1]
All in all, AVOID THIS CASH GRAB AT ALL COSTS. It clearly needs more time to be a better game. Atleast 2 more years. THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL that this game is worth £60. NEVERMIND THAT... NOT WORTH £83.99. I will be issuing a refund as this is yet another game that is a complete joke.

Redfall,1294810,137653704,"Ok, I finished the game on Layla. This game seems good by the cover. But I've had some issues with it. Previous issues mentioned here was my fault. Not getting the ""Stake"" option to kill a vampire was due to me not having a gun with stake selected (I had it on me) when stepping up to a downed vampire. That could have been fixed by the Devs.. But.. Where's the blood in this vampire game? I didn't see any when shooting enemies? Is there a gore-option somewhere? All I've been through when beating the game was blood on the floor and some set-up death spots.

Problem 1: Performance, the one everyone is talking about. FPS drops, and some places it's real bad. The graphics isn't 2020 even, so why the issues? Did you completely rely on DLSS taking everything so nice you thought you didn't need optimization?

Problem 2: Loot. I've had the same 5 uniques dropping over and over. And this game likes shotguns. Like really like them, you get the first unique shotgun for free, just 4 minutes into the game on a new character. Unique is the best tier of loot btw. Uniques has randomness to them, but has ONE trait that all those named guns have. So the loot is just repeated. There's like 2 of every guntype in the game, except for Stakeguns, UV guns. two flareguns, two shotguns, two handguns,  two snipers, two assault rifles.. And that's it, they drop with RNG stats in tiers grey/white, green, blue, purple and gold. Devs thought that was enough! Hah! And there's no loot tables, everything can drop everywhere, or looted from crates..

Problem 3: Maps, there's just TWO maps. And five bosses. The first map is therefor automatically a tutorial map, with 1 boss. The four others is in the second map. And no, you can't go back to the first map once you've completed that map. Unless..

Problem 4: Endgame. There is none. There's NG+ where you start at your level with your gear and everything scales. Just not the weapons, you still get greys all through-out the game. I told you, everything drops everywhere.. You could do Vampire nests, over and over? Or Play through the game on NG+ and NG++? I don't feel the need to go NG+, as there's nothing NEW, and you're about level 20 at the end of the main missions, and max level is 40. So I assume two playthroughs and you're max level. But why? Game get's easier and easier the more skillpoints you have.

Problem 5: There's clearly some lazyness going on here, a lot of copy and paste systems. All safehouses looks the same once you're in.

Problem 6: No matchmaking or finding a party to play with. You have to add them to a friendslist (there's also a crossplay friendslist). No one bothers to do that, I soloed it all.

Problem 7: Classes and their abilities feels useless. I forgot I even had them. Even at the brink of death, I didn't see a solution with them. They were more of a utility than damage or a save from death.

Problem 8: The difficulty in this sucks, I had it at the easiest, as I don't want bullet-spongebob enemies. And yet I had a hard time at parts. The vampires overwhelm you, and you get a Rook storm on you at the same time, due to the randomness of it, while already fighting a vampire boss.",False,2,2294

Redfall,1294810,137653643,"UPDATE: IT'S DEAD. Arkane Austin is now defunct and the promised DLC has been cancelled. If you bought the DLC with money, expect a refund or compensation of some kind. Servers are up for now but they will be shut down at some point. I think offline mode will be added, but you're better off playing any other singleplayer game.

If you weren't sold on this game during the previews, your skepticism was well-placed. This game falls flat in a lot of areas. The promise of epic vampire slaying is, in reality, mostly dealing with human cultists and getting swarmed by vampires when you enter a house and trying to not run out of ammo.

>Characters

You get to pick from four (with two more on the way that will be available for a price) characters. They each have their own backstory, abilities, and unique lines when interacting with characters. This aspect isn't terrible, although I feel like these characters don't offer much introduction and found it difficult to find them likable.

You get several skill trees but there are only so many points in the game. Want to re-spec? Not an option. Roll a new character and do it [i]all over again[/i]. This is not helped by the fact that XP is not awarded for killing enemies but rather completing quests, furthering the disconnect between what the game is trying to be.

This is also a HUGE issue when you have skills that are worthless if you are playing solo, only providing benefits to interacting with other players.


>Weapons

Meh. They shoot but they don't feel particularly meaningful. The vampire-slaying weapons are cool but you run out of ammo easily. I saw footage of the UV-blasting weapon and it seemed... boring. This isn't helped by the fact that the game seems to be stingy about not giving automatic weapons to low-leveled players, which are the most fun.


>Open-World

This is the weakest link of the game. Enemies are scattered about in weird places standing around or coming out of the trees, almost like the game is actively planting them in your way to throw you off. This is not helped by the fact that the game's world is tiny by open-world standards.

The experience is similar to Far Cry, where safehouses are the default location to pick up new missions that will progress an area and unlock more content. Unfortunately, it falls flat where Far Cry normally succeeds in gameplay.

>User Experience

This game did not invest heavily into good player design. From the moment you pick up your first gun, the game will pause and force you to read a wall of text on how to shoot. This happens several times whenever you discover a new mechanic. At most, these should be brief text boxes that show up in the HUD for a short time. In short, a lot of telling and not much showing.

Even before getting into the menu, being hit with a character select screen was not something I was expecting. I just got the game, why am I being asked to pick a character? I have options to set first!

Outside of that nonsense, the main menu's design felt bland, which was actually my first red flag while I was setting the options. Boring font, boring menus, etc. Something felt off for sure.

>Story

Aside from the basic intro and a few missions, I did not get far into the story before calling it quits. I just wasn't into the game enough to care.

That being said, the story feels watered down by how cheap the production feels. The intro cutscene is a slideshow and voiceover. The same happens later in the game but with still 3D models. That's right, no animated cutscenes in a $70 game.

I knew something was wrong when the entire firehouse was being rebuilt instantly by characters that I had never met moments after clearing it. While this is a thing in Far Cry after clearing a major location, it feels cheap to do this for what is essentially your main base of operations.


>Music

I don't like trap music, even if it's mixed with church bells. I don't think it works but that's just my opinion.


>Multiplayer

You can do this game solo, if you wish. The game has a way of balancing difficulty with more players if you choose to bring friends. Just be warned that any progress you make in someone else's game will only progress the host's main story.

This is not something I would like to see as it disincentivizes co-op gameplay and may potentially be used as a way of padding out game time, forcing players to complete the same content again.


>BUGS

I didn't get much time in before calling it quits but I saw a floating object in a cutscene and a vampire that was in a state of undeath, moreso than usual. Stuck vampires seem to be a problem a lot of other views are reporting as well.

I did not have major framerate issues, but I am running on a 4090. Consoles have not been so lucky, being stuck to 30 fps.


>Final Words

I wanted this game to be good, I really did. I like the idea of fighting vampires in the modern age with homemade implements of destruction, but something must have happened in development. If this is the product we got after a year's delay, I shudder to imagine what it looked like before.

In short, this very much feels like something that would be given to play testers instead of a finished game. If you waste $70 on it, I will be sad. If you got it from a promo like I did, don't waste your time playing it. Do whatever you can to let the industry know that games of this quality are not worth this much money.",False,2,106

Pros
-Audio is really good ! Characters voicing is on point! Creepy Vampire sounds in Surround sound are really good!
-Lots of cool looking guns, the looting is satisfying and not loot vomit, its a good flow of loot
-FOV slider
-Can sprint, slide and reload
-Vampires
-Gunplay feels decent, its pretty much just like Deathloops gunplay and weapon feedback. It does the job.
-Super natural powers on each character is pretty neat. Each character plays differently and these abilities are actually useful. 


Cons
-Runs like doggy doo, all settings on Medium DLSS on performance I get 30-90 frames but it constantly jumps around sometimes dipping into the 30s
-Graphics look meh
-No Matchmaking?? in a COOP GAME HOW?
-Game runs TERRIBLY 
-Open areas feel very empty, the town with all of its filler is very sad. Alot of buildings you cannot enter and long stretches of nothingness make it feel almost like a pre alpha of some kind of cheap indie game..
-AI is braindead, running and gunning turns the AI brains OFF. 
-Leveling up feels very minor, the skills are nothing to write home about. Increase ammo capacity, increase health etc etc. 

Game has alot of potential, match making is a must and the performance needs to be fixed. I CANNOT justify spending 70 USD on this game esp in its current state. When the game does work its awesome, when youre indoors fighting multiple vampires and all you can see is the illumination from your flashlights its awesome ! But when you are doing pretty much anything else its very lackluster. rapid fire here are a few other things that bother me. If you really wanna play this game try it on gamepass.

It has scaled loot like Borderlands, exploration like Far Cry, and a more grounded feel of Dead Island, but it feels like it does each one poorly. Gunplay is... meh, guns sound very poor and don't feel impactful, accuracy seems to be randomized somehow even when you are aiming down sights? No point in stealth because none of the enemies pose any threat, due to the AI being bad.

Not worth 70. If I don't see it picking up by the two hour mark, I'm going to refund.

I'll update more when I get further in, but first impressions are not good. It does run pretty well on high settings though, with my specs:
CPU R7 3700X
GPU RX 5700 XT
32 GB DDR4 RAM

EDIT: After playing for another hour, I have run into some performance issues. The game drops frames hard when particle effects are on screen, usually from skills. 

The game itself is just, boring. Go here, kill enemies, mark a thing for pickup, repeat. Most enemies are not challenging at all, the ones who are just have annoying abilities (Pick you up and keep you from playing the game for a full 10 seconds while you watch yourself die, limit your vision to a small sphere, etc.). Low-level vamps just run in a straight line at you and die.

Item rarity looter shooter cookie cutter mechanics. Gotta love how every co-op game implements this nowadays, without fully realizing why games that have successfully implemented this system works well (Destiny 2, for example, might be a bad game in most people's eyes, but it's itemization is pretty good, and there's a reason why the game has millions of players. Marvel's Avengers, another looter gear score game, flopped and failed hard for failing to implement well, among other factors. Same case here.) It feels like they just put a gear score system in without any thought behind it besides: ""Other looter shooters have this, we gotta have it.""

I'd rather be able to pick the guns I want and put attachments on them as I see fit, and upgrade them over time, rather than relying on random drops to give me 50 handguns, 30 shotguns, and maybe 2-3 assault rifles. That don't even have scopes. Gotta be lucky to get a scope!

PSA: Please don't review bomb games just because they are not perfect and just because every triple A game has not even run recently. And please don't give games positive reviews simply because they run.

[h1] Short version [/h1]

FINAL THOUGHTS (some spoilers):
For $100 (CAD)/ 76 USD/ 70 EUR  I'm really on the fence at this stage after playing 2 hours I can see the gameplay becoming repetitive quickly. It makes me sad to say because I have enjoyed each of the Dishonored series and Deathloop; but I am not convinced it's worth the price at this time. 

I do enjoy the gameplay despite it becoming repetitive after only 2 hours.

My opinion is to wait for a sale.

[h1] Long Version [/h1]

FACTS:
-Yes the game works even though some people are experiencing issues.
-It does launch unlike Jedi Survivor, and does not put you in an infinite loading screen unlike The Last of Us
-It does have localised issues. I even had to close and reopen the game on first launch
-There is some stuttering, mostly minor and not all the time but it is there.
-A game simply working is not a reason to give it a positive review
-A game not being 100% perfect because every triple A game lately has barely worked for anyone is not a reason to give it a negative review.

OPINIONS:
-I appreciate making games is expensive but I find it overpriced.
-Gameplay is kind of repetitive
-Gameplay is a bit easy once you get the hang of it
-If you are lucky enough you can find top tier yellow weapons early on which will mow down bosses pretty easy which kind of ruins it [spoiler] there are also only 5 safehouse bosses so even if it scales if you find a yellow shotgun or a 90 damage sniper you can pretty much zerg any of the big enemies [/spoiler]

PERFORMANCE:

While having Discord on and streaming Netflix over discord to someone:

-Playing on 1440p
-Runs very well so far i9-9900k 35% usage 
-GPU 50-60% on RTX 2080
-Average PC latency does seem a little high even after not streaming it is around 80-120ms regardless
-For some reason my FPS will not display but so far runs pretty smooth roughly around 50-60 most of the time on both epic graphics and high only the occasional stutter when loading an area but it's minuscule
-I believe most of the performance issues people are experiencing are likely case by case. 

Performance summary:
So far the game seems good and runs pretty well. Small stutters occasionally only one time was there a big stutter where I sprinted at a large group of enemies that I think were on the border of an area so the game tried to load the area, have all of them attack me, cancel them all attacking me because I shotgunned them all in the head. One ran away I blew up the ATV he was behind.


GAMEPLAY (WARNING small SPOILERS):

A lot like Far Cry especially the newer ones (all of them?) where you take over a neighborhood in this case. Fight a boss get a skull from the boss where you can use it to fight even bigger bosses (gods) or find special loot so the game tells me.

The gameplay is similar to Deathloop but with Deathloop you had the mystery and the progression where in Redfall so far it just reminds me of Far Cry 5 which is just the same thing over and over. Yes the story missions are different but I expect a bit later in the story you'll have to do all the safehouses. Yes (SPOILER) there are only [spoiler] 5 safehouses [/spoiler] but apart from [spoiler] supply drops [/spoiler] and the [spoiler] boss fights [/spoiler] I do see it becoming repetitive.


AI no is not the smartest but the vampire as well as many of the enemies did actually attack me and the stealth definitely works fine for me including the noise alerts etc. Very much like Dishonored reminds me of the guards in the first game but we were fine with it then so not sure why it's a problem now.

-More similar to Deathloop than Dishonored I would say but with a few takeaways from Dishonored if you want to compare Arkane's previous accomplishments.

Gunplay is good not great but good. Headshots do count and hitboxes are pretty tight. Half a head you can hit but a sliver of a head is a bit too small. But its a CO-OP fps not Apex


VISUALS:

Visually it has comic book style damage numbers and stuff. Graphics/art style more reminiscent of Deathloop than Dishonored except for the consistent character style across all Arkane games (which looks great.)

Graphics are a tiny bit underwhelming considering I am playing on epic. They definitely went with more of the pop art candy flashy style that Deathloop had rather than the really nice heavy detail of Dishonored but Deathloop was more stylised than RedFall and I think it was a little bit of a missed opportunity but that's a personal preference more than anything.

Redfall,1294810,137652138,"I played and beat this game before any day 1 patch was up, I don't even know (if) there was a day 1 patch. The game ran pretty alright, it hitched every once in a while on high and medium, so i nuked it down to low. The game itself is a very uninspired amalgamation of many different co-op shooters that manages to not get any of them right. It has no idea who its target audience is. That being said the exploration is bland, the shooting is blander, i see more variety at the baskin robins than i do in the enemy types. Story and characters exist as much as my self worth does.

tl;dr it's a game with a neat concept that ends up disappointing. While i don't recommend it, i wouldn't talk you out of it

(edited again because some people don't believe that the game is completed in 12 hours, you unlock the 4th difficulty eclipse finishing the last boss. you are sent back to the very start of the game after the credits, so you are unable to explore the open world if you so wished it. https://imgur.com/a/Dii84x1 )",False,1471,727

Redfall,1294810,137651757,"---> One year and 5 days later and what do we have? Nothing in the way of updates, fixes, content, or even word. The last was in Nov 2023 which wasn't anything special. At this point why are they not just shifting it to a single player game and taking that always online mess out? They could also lower it to sub 40 because it's still not worth the asking price.

2024 despite the few updates things are roughly the same. Were in the new year and we don't have much if any word on what they plan. So I'm not hopeful. If you're thinking about getting this make sure it's on sale and really discounted. Server stability seems to be somewhat worse but that could just my experience.

--Release Review--
I have seen a few bugs in this game. I haven't had any performance issues with this game even on my Lenovo S7 laptop that has a 3060ti. I don't mind the stylized graphics. I prefer a game looks like a game. I don't need hyper real graphics. -- SCRATCH THAT ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE. I finally ran into textures taking forever to load and tree's are really scuffed for some reason. 

30 fps is the least of their worries at this point. Where is the complex level design? Where is the character details? Where is the story? I know there are the scraps of paper in the world but that is all suppose to be supplemental I thought. Slide show cut scenes and where is the pace? Story isn't good. This is a far cry from Dishonored and Prey in every single way. Uninspired skills in the tree. 

The AI in this game feels terrible. They aren't a challenge and don't seem to path correctly at times. Sometimes they don't even walk they glide along the surface of the ground like Frozone from the Incredibles. 

Navigating the world is boring. Some say flat. Just feels generic and uninspired. You're not rewarded for exploration. I had to jump on console to play this and have a better experience. 

Stealth doesn't matter at all.

Gun play needs to be improved. I mean what happened here with gun play?

Some of the voice acting really hurts to listen to. An what's up with some of these character models. They are really trying to make people hard to look at in modern games to appeal to some portion of the audience that probably doesn't play their games. 

The world feels a empty.

I like the music on a high note. I don't mind the stylized graphics.I think this game isn't a total loss. I think it is serviceable and you can have fun in it. But really you are only going to get about 12hrs out of this game.

I think this is terribly priced. 70 for the base is laughable. In this state it's not worth it. An the extra 30 BUCKS for the pittance of extra content you get with the Bite Back edition is just a slap in the face. 

If you want to play this game. I suggest you GAMEPASS this title. I don't suggest you buy this at all here on steam until the issues are fixed and it's or its on sale at a reasonable discount of lets say 45 percent. Because lets face it. They are serving you an unfinished product just like JEDI SURVIVOR was an unfinished product and it's like asking you to buy an bran new but incomplete car from the dealer and telling you to limp around in it until they decide fix it up the way it was marketed to you.

You can have fun in this game don't get me wrong. But it's not the experience we were sold in trailers and media. Get it if you want to have it. I love Arkane and think they will turn this around. At least I'm hopeful.",False,1,248
