The early experience delivered unpredictable moments and ridiculous vehicle plays that everyone loved, even if it wasn’t polished.

A few months later the patches toned things down. The vehicle changes removed a lot of that launch-era craziness, and while the gunplay was decent, it felt more arcade-like and less true to classic Battlefield roots. After that, I stepped away from the game for about a year.

Coming back right before BF6 released, the game was in a much better place.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,208866029,"Battlefield 2042 is a first-person shooter developed by DICE and released in 2021. Set in a near-future global conflict, it abandons the series’ historical and modern-war settings for a high-tech battlefield featuring advanced gadgets, dynamic weather, and massive player counts. It was designed to showcase next-generation scale and chaos but launched with significant issues that affected its reception.

The game features 128-player matches on large, open maps, emphasizing vehicle warfare and player freedom. Traditional classes were replaced by a new “Specialist” system, where each character has unique abilities and equipment. This shift aimed to encourage flexibility but diluted team roles, reducing the tactical coordination that defined earlier Battlefield titles.

Core gunplay and movement feel fluid, with improved weapon handling and traversal mechanics. However, balance problems, inconsistent weapon tuning, and erratic hit registration plagued the launch. The map design, while visually impressive, often felt too large and empty, leading to disorganized gameplay and long travel times between engagements.

Graphically, Battlefield 2042 demonstrates the full capability of the Frostbite engine. Massive storms, tornados, and destructible environments create dramatic visual moments. Weather systems and map-changing events deliver spectacle but sometimes interfere with gameplay clarity. Sound design and atmosphere remain strong, maintaining the immersive audio identity of the franchise.

At release, the game lacked a single-player campaign, focusing entirely on multiplayer modes: All-Out Warfare, Hazard Zone, and Portal. All-Out Warfare provides the classic large-scale experience; Hazard Zone blends extraction-style mechanics with tactical objectives; and Portal allows players to create custom matches using assets from Battlefield 1942, Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. Portal became a highlight due to its flexibility and nostalgia value.

Performance and stability were major concerns early on, with bugs, UI issues, and server instability dominating launch feedback. Over time, DICE released extensive patches that improved optimization, restored classic class structures, and overhauled maps to increase combat density. The post-launch updates gradually transformed the game into a more stable and coherent experience.

In summary, Battlefield 2042 began as an ambitious but uneven experiment that traded structure for scale. While its launch was rough, consistent updates have made it more enjoyable and closer to the series’ roots. It remains visually stunning and technically impressive, but its design choices divided fans. For players seeking large, chaotic, modern battles with evolving support, it has matured into a solid—if unconventional—entry in the Battlefield series.",True,0,253

Not without its flaws, a very long way from the likes of BF2 and BF4 but a decent Battlefield game nonetheless.

I gave up on the game during its launch period but frankly I enjoyed playing 2042 in the lead up to the release of BF6 much more than anticipated. In fact I'd go as far to say I found this game more enjoyable and more close to a proper Battlefield game than BF6.

Well worth a buy on sale if you like tinkering with game modes.
I like the Portal experience where i can make my own game and rules.
Like WW2 US soldiers versus Modern RU for example.
Another cool feature is projectile speed that can be changed ,so a bullet flys at half speed.
I also like to tweak soldier health and vehicle health too.
I think the default vehicle health is too high -
realistically a couple of Rpgs should take out a vehicle - so I reduce this health value.
You can make the game 2 shot kills if you want for infantry ,maybe 1 for snipers and shotgun slugs.


Runs OK on older laptop -just limit fps to 57fps and play at 720p ,this will reduce CPU heat a lot. In a similar vein i made a User.cfg to use only 2/3rds of my cpu cores and threads -this also reduces CPU heat.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,207906417,"BF2042: The Underrated Titan of the Battlefield Franchise

Honestly, BF2042 has evolved into something special — F2042 delivers some of the best core gameplay the series has ever seen.
Best movement, best weapon handling, best vehicle handling, great spotting, and great maps — alone, those five points make it a dream to play for anyone who values the classic Battlefield feeling refined to perfection.

Add to that better weapon customization and modification, maps spanning nearly every Battlefield era, vault weapons and vehicles, and the freedom to jump into ANY (classic) gamemode — all while enjoying constant events, a ton of easter eggs, and hidden secrets scattered throughout. It’s the most content-rich and flexible Battlefield to date.

Most importantly, it’s now a complete, fully functional, non-buggy, premium FPS — and you can grab it for just a couple of bucks. That’s insane value for what you’re getting.

After experiencing how polished and satisfying BF2042 has become, it’ll be a long while before I feel like dishing out cash for an overpriced, monetized BF6.

Quite different from previous Battlefield games, and as controversial to say it, I like this game. Many people say this game is full of bugs and glitches but from the time I played, I haven't found any. just funny rag-doll physics
●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●Positives●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●
- Different Eras: The game offers guns and such from different eras, including Battlefield 3, and Battlefield World War II. so it's pretty cool to have them mashed up
- Massive maps: There were some pretty big maps in other Battlefield games but I feel like this game has bigger maps than before. 
- Weapons: As before, this game offers guns from the other series, so whilst there isn't my personal favourites in the game, I still find myself switching to different guns because of how much I like them.
- Action Packed: Despite the large maps, there's still a lot of action in even small lobbies. There might be some times that there isn't anyone to kill but if you keep searching you'll definitely find someone
- Satisfying kills: I've played the other Battlefield games (I own all besides 6), and it's nice to get kills in those, but weirdly I find it's more satisfying to get kills in this game than the other games. Maybe I'm being biased but I can't help but to think how smoothly I killed someone.
●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●Negatives●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●
Some negative things I've thought of counting as a positive but from personal experience with them, I'm still at a cross
- Specialists: I love having different characters to choose from, it's pretty fun and each character brings something new to the battlefield. However, as much as I like having them, it's also a major downside. It breaks what Battlefield had in my opinion. Classes defined the person you had, not operators and their abilities. With some having shields, it feels like they took a page from Rainbow Six Siege's book. People Blitz rushing you with shields is really annoying and unless you think of something quick, there's not really a way to counter them either. 
- Small lobby limits: As someone who plays Team Death Match the most, it only allows up to 32 players at max, which sounds like a lot but it's not when you have massive maps, especially when a lot of players love to camp in one spot.
- Money hungry taking over fun: Another reference I'm going to make to the game, the idea of customizing your specialist and with bundles just makes it feel like Siege. While yes it's nice to have something to customize to your liking, it also costs a lot of money, and it's not like this game is cheap anyways.
- Dropped like it was unwanted: I love the Battlefield series so I was excited to play this game when I bought it, although as soon as they announced Battlefield 6, that's when this game became irrelevant. It was as like they said ""well we got our money from this game so onto the next one."". This means, the glitches and bugs other players reported, won't get noticed for a very long time, and that hackers will likely to take over servers here soon.
- Spawn can be iffy a lot: I can count some instances where I spawned on top of something that killed me, and no I didn't move right away, the game spawned me on it. First, I spawned on top of a claymore, the game might spawn you randomly, but why there? It was both weird and annoying to die a millisecond of spawning in. and second, I died to spawning in on top of fire. Iwo Jima has some on going fire on the map and I just so happen to spawn on top of the fire, it didn't kill me but it did take a lot of HP, which then someone killed me within seconds of getting away from the fire
●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●Conclusion●▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●
This game has its ups and downs, and while yes I see more downs and ups, I can't help but to keep playing. I's both addicting and engaging. As someone who loves Battlefield, I can say however, this review may become irrelevant in the future, as like the other Battlefields, this too may end up having dead servers.",True,0,1981

At launch, the game definitely had problems — tons of bugs, missing features, and it didn’t really feel like the old Battlefield everyone loved. But after all the updates, it’s a completely different game now. The gunplay feels great, the maps are way better, and the new specialists system actually makes sense once you get used to it.

The large-scale battles with 128 players are insane in a good way. When everything explodes around you, helicopters flying over, tanks rolling in — that classic Battlefield chaos is back. The graphics and sound design are also top-notch, as always.

Of course, it’s not perfect. Some maps still feel too big or empty, and matchmaking can be a bit slow. But overall, it’s way better than what people say. I think most of the hate came from the early days, and people just never gave it another chance.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,207432882,"BF2042 had a poor launch, coupled with bugs and unpolished maps. This more or less doomed it commercially because the internet has swift, brutal reactions and rarely deviates from initial judgments. 

Fast forward a couple years, and this game is polished, smooth, and extremely fun. I would argue the internet slept on this game, because it has been the best shooter on the market for several years, with great gunplay, squad gameplay, and a variety of maps and vehicles. The movement is fast-paced and quick, which makes gunfights extremely chaotic at times; the movement style is reminiscent of Titanfall or Apex Legends. I think this game gets a lot of undue hate because it dared to be different than other Battlefield games. It is less realistic and allows itself to be a little more silly than other Battlefield entries, but that quirkiness adds a much needed element of joy and fun to the game (the entire ""story"" with the no pats is frankly amazing in a silly, 1980s action movie kind of way). The reality is that most of the criticisms levied against it by the ""hardcore"" or ""older generation"" Battlefield fans are illegitimate when you break them down (or think critically for more than 0.2 seconds). E.g., 2042 gets a lot of hate for being ""less realistic"" than other Battlefield entries, but no one making this criticism actually wants realism, they [i]want[/i] to have a reason to hate this game. 

If you have a chance to pick it up on sale--which should be easy these days--consider giving it a shot. If you like modern games or movement shooters, you will probably enjoy this. Possibly more than BF6; considering BF6--at time of writing--feels and plays like a game from 20 years ago while BF2042 is more modern.

Wish they'd bring back Conquest 64, I'd probably still play this game.

Pros
+Weather system adds a random chaotic element that I enjoyed (Tornadoes in particular were thrilling)
+The vehicle call in system was good at preventing players from wasting time in the re-spawn screen for vehicles
+Great vehicle variety with interesting twists on every form of transport

- Season 01 already signaling that they are going to add CoD 7-colors tropical bird quirky chungus special snowflake unit/weapon skins, which goes against what the devs promised.
- Female screaming in war (which is fine I love to hear them suffer) but if I want male screaming in war suddenly it's wrongthink and problematic. Technically I can farm and unlock male skins but there is no reason I can't just switch to male/female at will for each class. I can't even play male NATO support.
- Small map pool.
- Most maps are as big as my nostrils, gunfight every 50m you walk. Need more bigger maps.
- Inconsistent destructible objects. Some are some aren't for whatever reason.
- Stupid challenges made by people who do not play the game.

I’ve also leaned into being a taker — pushing aggressively to capture points, secure vehicles, and turn the tide of fights. Whether it’s locking down a sector solo or coordinating with teammates, those moments of chaos and control make the game rewarding.

On top of that, I’ve logged plenty of time in the skies as a pilot. Mastering helicopters and jets has been a huge learning curve, but flying support runs, evading missiles, and delivering precise strikes feels incredible when it all comes together.

What's wrong with this game:

-The maps are so goddamn horrendous 64 player Conquest is essentially unplayable

-128 player Conquest is straight up just unplayable because the servers piss and shit themselves so hard that everything teleports at all times

-Vehicles are hilariously overpowered. The TRANSPORT Helicopter got re-classified as an attack helicopter because it has 4!!!!!!!!!!!! gunner seats on it?????? And essentially every other transport vehicle also has 4 gunner seats, making the transport vehicles the strongest attack vehicles for some godforsaken reason.

-Portal is dead and purely afk xp farms

-The extraction shooter gamemode thing is entirely dead so no clue if that's worth anything because you just cannot find a match

-Seriously the maps are so bad in so many different ways it's hard to even describe the ways they fail

-It's *alright* if you only plan on playing breakthrough but even then, with how overpowered vehicles are and only attackers getting them every single round will be an attacker stomp unless you play on one of the maps without vehicles.

-No ability to exclude certain maps from matchmaking

-The spawning system is amazingly bad, putting you in no-man's land 50 kilometers away from any objective with no cover literally anywhere so good luck!

-Mouse inputs simply get dropped at random

-Destruction barely exists

I've enjoyed Battlefield 2042 but it wasn't as great as others such as Battlefield 3, 4 and 1. The gunplay felt a bit too quick, feeling more like a Call Of Duty then the average battlefield experience. The game is overall fun though and I did enjoy some of its weapons feeling absolutely broken to play with once you put the right attachements. 

To me, some of the most fun games I had were with the 128 players conquests games. Even if it felt like you were dying on repeat and couldn't solo flank an objective, the pure chaos of it was really fun! Def hoping some gamemode of it can be available on BF6's Portal mode.

Now one of the things I disliked in this game was the Hazard Zone gamemode. Ngl, it felt like a pathetic attempt at an Extraction Shooter. The gamemode isn't dead-dead but there is a really small community, so when you'll play it you might always be playing with the same people in your lobbies. It also felt dull with the goal of getting devices and them being really easy to get (only stacking up to 5, could have been better if you could get unlimited from looting people).

Now that it’s reached the end of its life cycle, I can say Battlefield 2042 served its purpose. It was never meant to be the next great Battlefield, even though it was hyped as one. In the end, it feels more like a stepping stonea placeholder that gave DICE time to prepare for what fans truly wanted, which we’re finally getting with Battlefield 6.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,206437588,"I honestly didn’t think it was possible to make a Battlefield this bad.

When the game first dropped, I skipped it. I came back to it later, already having played almost every BF (except Hardline, and I barely touched BF1). And man… after BF5 and the open beta of BF6, this one - Battlefield 2042 - just feels awful.

And I’m not even talking about graphics or visuals - no, that’s fine. The gameplay itself is just straight-up terrible.

Yeah, there are massive 100-player modes, but the maps are so stretched out and empty that you spend forever running in silence with nothing happening. They’re so wide open that most capture points are completely dead - zero action, zero fun.

Weapon and vehicle balance is a joke. Gunplay has no feeling at all - every weapon feels like a laser gun, no recoil, no weight, nothing satisfying about it.

Vehicles? Same deal - total letdown. I love rolling in tanks, and in BF5, when you and your buddy roll up to a point, you feel that power - the tank feels heavy, impactful, dangerous.
Here? You’re just a slightly tougher SUV. Everyone can shred you, and the physics... it’s like driving on melted butter. No weight, no detail, no realism at all.

And what they did with classes and specialists - absolute cringe. Classes should be fixed. Assault has its weapons, Support has theirs. When everyone can pick whatever, it turns into a total mess.

No story mode either. That short intro cutscene when you first launch the game - that’s it. They might as well not have bothered.

Honestly, I couldn’t even force myself to finish the battle pass for the BF6 skins - I uninstalled after 17 hours.

This game is a total disappointment. You can tell by how the community reacted - everyone just went back to older titles. For a while, BF1 from 2016 even became the most played again.
Then after BF6 came out, 2042’s player count completely died again.

Sure, Battlefield games usually launch broken - that’s nothing new. But after a few months, they get fixed, and people end up loving them. Not this time though. Four years later, Battlefield 2042 is still one of the worst games in the series - and rightfully so.
The community sent a clear message to EA: rush jobs don’t fly anymore. They somehow managed to screw up even worse than BF5’s launch.

Rating for BF 2042 - 4.5/10

Let me add this - when the action actually does happen, it’s pure chaos.
If you were hoping for some hardcore mayhem in the middle of explosions and gunfire - yeah, that’s exactly what it is.
But it’s not the good kind. It’s like watching a Brazzers scene - intense banging, but zero emotion or feeling behind it. Just noise and chaos.

‎ 
[i]2042[/i] is a game that they wanted to be a long lasting title in the franchise with the main focus being multiplayer which was made apparent in the marketing but what we got was a striped back almost beta-like game, especially on release. 
Years of updates have dragged the game into a serviceable state, but by the time things improved it was already to late, the damage was done. On top of that, microtransactions and a heavy emphasis on cosmetic skins and collaborations felt out of place and only added to the sense that the game prioritized monetization instead of the community.
I believe that disdain for the game in general was necessary for the franchise to improve, which is hopefully what we are seeing with Battlefield 6.
‎ ‎ ‎ 
[b]Price Paid:[/b] [i]A$ 139.95.[/i]

[b]Achievements: [/b][i]Most come as you play, though some are extremely grindy. Portal can speed things up, but the hardest ones are probably in Hazard Zone, good luck finding a match.[/i]


[h1]Recommendation:[/h1]With [i]Battlefield 6[/i], there’s very little reason to pick up [i]2042[/i] at this point. And even then, previous entries in the series still have active player bases and arguably offer better experiences.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]Story.[/h2]
‎ 
A sequel to [i]Battlefield 4[/i], set 22 years in a climate-ravaged future, you play as the “No-Pats” — mercenaries hired by global superpowers to fight their wars. The premise had potential through gameplay with environmental collapse and destruction shaping the maps, but the game barely does anything with it. There is no single-player campaign which is a real disappointment as the single player was something I enjoyed a lot when I was younger. All the lore and worldbuilding that exists is scattered through the official website, community wiki, and what people have pieced together and shared on reddit. The game itself tells you almost nothing, except for what you may be able to surmise from trailers and maps. 
The writing for the Specialists, or No-Pats, is some of the most awkward and forced I’ve heard. The lines feel like they belong in a hero-shooter rather than coming from soldiers in the middle of a war, and yet even with all the quotes and their design they lack any actual personality. 

[h2]Gameplay.[/h2]
‎‎ 
The ambition with [i]2042[/i] was clear, but the execution leaves the core gameplay feeling stretched thin. Even with 128-player battles, maps can feel enormous and empty, where you can end up running for some time with little happening only to get gunned down by a jet or sniped by a tank which is especially bad when you are primarily an infantry player. Majority of the time, at least in OCE, full 128-player lobbies are uncommon, and most matches are filled with bots and the classic 64 player matches being the most popular, for good reason. 

Tornadoes and storms rip through maps in [i]2042[/i], which is impressive and exciting the first time you see them, maybe even the next few times. But the novelty quickly wears off, and they become more of an annoyance than anything disrupting your HUD, interfering with electronics, and tossing you around. 

The introduction of Specialists felt like a step backwards. Instead of creating more freedom and flexibility with loadouts, they ended up reducing team play. Even after the reintroduction of a semi-class system, individual character gadgets still felt like the main focus rather than team roles. While weapon access was opened up, DICE tried to justify class-specific weapons through small proficiency bonuses, for example, Assault players getting three extra magazines. However, this did very little.

Portal mode is easily the best feature to come out of[i] 2042[/i], offering a sandbox where players can build and share custom game modes using content from past [i]Battlefield[/i] titles. While it’s not something I personally spent much time with, there’s a featured game mode that rotates weekly on the home screen, often created by community members or even YouTubers and streamers. The mode also includes a server browser, allowing you to find and join populated lobbies, though usually with reduced XP gains.

Hazard Zone is an attempt at a ‘high-stakes’ squad-based extraction mode, [b]often compared to Tarkov[/b] — though it’s not on the same page let alone in the same book. You and three squadmates are dropped into an OG [i]2042[/i] map against multiple enemy teams, tasked with collecting data drives while fighting AI and other players. After gathering enough drives, you have two chances to extract via VTOL, which almost always turns into a fight over the extraction points. Very few people play this mode because it doesn’t offer much, and even when you do find players, it’s common to encounter campers that purely just sit at extract points. It’s an exhausting experience, and to complete achievements, I had to use a VPN just to find eight players for a single match.
‎‎ 
[h2]Difficulty.[/h2]
‎‎ 
Since [i]Battlefield 2042[/i] is primarily multiplayer, the challenge in PvP matches depends almost entirely on your skill and who you get matched with. The game also offers AI bot modes, which range from just shooting sitting targets to surprisingly tough opponents who are better than most players. Or, if you prefer, you can just sit in a tank an entire match like a Jackass.
‎‎ 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3582080556
[h2]Visuals.[/h2]
‎‎ 
Visually, the textures, models, and effects in [i]2042[/i] are all solid.[b] The problem is the art direction[/b], everything looks too clean and sterile, lacking personality or distinctive detail, which makes the game look worse than it actually is. They did attempt to rectify this over time by adding more debris around the maps but it did very little to improve the overall bland style. That said, some of the map releases later on were better designed and offered genuinely solid experiences.
‎ 
[h2]Audio.[/h2]
‎‎ 
Audio is a downgrade across the board compared to previous entries. While it has improved since release, the overall range still feels limited, certain sound effects come across as compressed, and directional audio is unreliable. Footsteps are often difficult to track or simply fail to play entirely, tanks can sometimes just sneak up on you with little warning. 
[b]The soundtrack is equally forgettable[/b]. It lacks identity and comes across as generally generic. While it may fit the game’s theme, it fails to stand out or add any real emotion to the gameplay, unlike, dare I say, the previous titles.
‎ 
[h2]Performance and Bugs.[/h2]
‎ 
I’ve seen a lot of complaints about poor performance, but [b]honestly my experience has been the opposite[/b]. The game runs smoothly, stable frame rates even in 128-player matches, and no stuttering or crashes on my end. I still ran into the occasional bug however, even after years of patches. Being disconnected from the server randomly, my character just floating next to the vehicle and broken animations when downed.

A simulation of the chaos I can feel building in my bones. Every round I play is one step closer to the inevitable headline: “World War III Begins — Gamer Was Ready.”

When I boot up 2042, I’m no longer in my barracks. I’m deployed to a near-future hellscape where drones scream overhead and the air tastes like copper and adrenaline. I’m in the zone. My pulse syncs with the gunfire. My brain’s rewired to the rhythm of war. I can practically hear the reactor humming in the distance as I mutter, “God help the first Ivan who crosses my crosshair.”

The devs probably didn’t intend for this to be psychological warfare training, but here I am, a sailor stationed halfway across the Pacific, using every match to sharpen my instincts. When the bullets start flying, I’ll already have 400 hours of combat experience—sure, it’s digital, but so are most modern targeting systems.

The game’s chaos feels real. Jets screaming through the smog, hovercrafts drifting across skyscrapers, medics reviving me like I owe them back pay—it’s beautiful carnage. It’s the kind of environment that forges warriors or breaks them. My squadmates may be 13-year-olds yelling “EZ” into their mics, but in my head, they’re comrades in arms—brothers and sisters of the digital front.

Sometimes when I’m on watch duty, I’ll catch a reflection in the glass and see that 2042 thousand-yard stare. My CO asked me once what I was thinking about. I told him the truth:

“Sir… I was thinking about flanking the Russians on Kaleidoscope.”

Battlefield 2042 isn’t perfect—yeah, it’s got bugs, lag, and the occasional tornado that eats your GPU alive—but perfection doesn’t prepare you for the apocalypse. War isn’t pretty. It’s messy. It’s unstable. It’s Battlefield.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,206278828,"Battlefield 2042 That Was Pain. I didn't plan to play it, but after the BF6 beta, Zampella was like: “Nope, I'm not finished with you” And all of that just for the Battle Pass. I wasn’t an exception.

It was rough: you play not because you want to, or because you enjoy it, but because you have to. There was zero fun in that. And on top of that it’s still BF 2042. Sure, it’s not the same game it was at launch. They’ve patched it up a bit, and now, in my opinion, it’s in a slightly above-average state.

This last event is like the final point of Battlefield 2042, its last performance on stage before leaving forever.
And yeah, it was tough, but I wouldn’t say it was completely awful. Yes, the game is still rough the recoil feels awkward, the guns feel like plastic toys, and shooting is pure RNG, with terrible hit registration. As for optimization, I can’t complain. I’ve got a powerful PC, so no issues there.

One big plus: lots of new players joined during the event, and matches were found instantly.
Also, some maps with weather effects were genuinely cool. Yeah, that was supposed to be the feature of this Battlefield, but now I finally get it, when a tarnado starts and you're right in the middle, it's awesome. The new Iwo Jima map is fun, and I finally managed to properly play Hazard Zone. Course, I was already tired of it, but I couldn't help but be happy after five wins in a row or successfully exiting 25 times it wasn't easy. This game is way better with friends — you’ll get far more enjoyment than playing solo. Although, to be honest, I doubt many will play it.
At least the game looks good on ultra settings.
It’s not Battlefield 1 with its stunning visuals, but if you don’t compare them directly, BF2042 actually looks fine.

In the last two weeks, I’ve played around 80–90 hours, while before that I only had about 14–15.
Now I’m sitting at roughly 150 hours.
And yeah, for some reason I decided to unlock every single achievement… Don’t ask me why.

Originally, I planned to write this review after finishing the Battle Pass, but if I had done it back then, it would’ve looked like this: “This is absolutely terrible. I’m never coming back”

But I decided to play for my own enjoyment, and I actually found some positive sides not many, but still.

Will I return to Battlefield 2042? Definitely not.
And honestly, I’m pretty sure the player count will drop even lower tomorrow — October 10 — when Battlefield 6 releases.
The game got its last chance: many people tried it for the first time thanks to the 95% discount — it was just $3, €3, or 30 kr.
Some old players even came back, and that was great because the servers were filled with life. Many were sitting on PORTAL maps farming XP.

But the event is over and the game is slowly dying and it will continue like this.
Anyone who played during the last Battlefild 2042event winessed a unique event the last flare of a dying star before it faded away forever. Battlefield 2042 is not the best entry in the series.

There are still a lot of problems that remain. But it had one last chance a chance for players to enjoy it, at least a bit, before it becomes a completely dead game.

Personally, I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. Too bad Steam doesn’t have a 50/50 rating, because that’s exactly what this game deserves.

In the end: Battlefield 2042 isn’t a great game.
It has its flaws, but I still managed to have some fun with it.",False,0,8886

Battlefield 2042,1517290,206253440,"It's a game. Not a Battlefield game but it is certainly a game that feels like it's inspired by it's predecessors. It's trying to be a million things at once while also trying to convince you it is just only one step up from BTF5. It works, it runs and the guns shoot, that's about all you can gather from it. 

The absence of a single-player takes away a massive core-identity of BTF games and you have no choice but to go head first into multiplayer PVP. If you have come from any of the previous games this will feel nothing like them and will likely bore you very rapidly if you are a stickler for the core tenets of the series. 

If you're reading this after the release of Battlefield 6, don't even waste your time downloading this game unless it's free. This game will forever be remembered as the game that wanted to be so much more but just ended up being known as a place-holder game for impatient players waiting for BTF6 to release and nothing else to do. 

I would say it was fun while it lasted but if I'm being objectively open about the game, you would have more fun and memorable times in BTF4 player hosted servers than anything portal could possibly offer.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,206240126,"Battlefield veteran here. I’ve been playing since Battlefield 2, and I’ve played all of them  except for Battlefield 5. I skipped that one because I didn’t like the beta and wasn’t going to pay for a game I knew I wouldn’t play.

But this one, Battlefield 2042, honestly… I played the beta, and it was terrible. I played for a month of EA’s subscription just to try it, and when the trial ended, I didn’t renew it because it simply wasn’t worth it. The game was incomplete at launch, the maps were bad, and there’s really not much to praise about it.

Some people might like it, but as someone who’s played all the Battlefield games, there’s nothing here that stands out in a good way. I’ve got around 250 hours in it only because I bought it on sale for about 4 bucks, and I was grinding BF6 skins in Portal servers while AFK. That’s the truth.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,206110637,"Well that was it Battlefield 2042. A game that started and ended with mixed emotions.
But believe it or not, as a big Battlefield fan, I gonna defend this title until the end, also because I felt some of the criticism unjustified. Why? Well you gonna find it out:

I played this game since the Beta and played almost every Season, so I have a very large opinion about this game. It’s so large that my review gonna be in bullet points to not make it too long.


Positive:
-Battlefield 2042 from all, the best conquest mode. Now it‘s almost impossible to capture one objective just by yourself in a 64 vs. 64 match. So I totally disagree that teamplay got worse, it got better. Good luck defending an objective by yourself when a transport vehicle comes to you.
-Due to the large scale maps, you are now just a small soldier on a big battlefield. That means in conquest you try control more an area of the map than the whole battlefield. This type of gameplay I could only experience on hardcore shooters like Hell Let Loose or Squad. But Battlefield 2042 proved you can get this great experience also on a casual shooter.
-The big maps are awesome with their diverse areas to play. I played them sooo much and still I haven’t seen enough. There are just so many places to explore. The other good thing of these map is, that they give freedom for every playstyle. For example in the old Hourglass map, you had so many possibilities. If you wanted to snipe, then go to the roof of the skyscrapers. If you want more of CQC like in Operation Metro, then go to the stadium.
-The plus system is awesome. Now you can modify your gun on the run if your combat situation changed. So no force to change your loadout on the menu anymore.
-The guns are balanced very well. Each category fulfils it’s purpose. Also Shotguns can finally be used outside of close combat thanks to the increased range. It‘s not the fault of the long area anymore, it depends of your tactic.
-Although I can agree that it sucks that we have specialist instead of classes, their gadgets like the wingsuit or ballistic shield, are just too much fun to dislike them.
-Even if you want to travel a long area of the map, you either pick a vehicle nearby or call a vehicle via your tablet. I never understood those people who complained that they needed to run minutes just to get to another objective. I always needed less than one minute moving on another objective. Even the tornado can be also used as a quick transport which looks cool at the same time.
-As an Battlefield 4 enjoyer myself, I can finally go another route against those elevator campers.
-Battlefield Portal is great.
-Almost all matches had a good team balance.
-The most most most important one: With my +750 hours playtime I witnessed maybe two or three cheaters, unlike Battlefield 5, where it was an every day situation.


Negative:
-Back in the day you felt, and sometimes still feel the problematic development for BF2042. On launch, the bugs really made Battlefield 2042 look unfinished and when they started to fix and update it, some new problems arrived and it got even worse. Now it is in a way better version, but it still feels a little bit unpolished like trying to redeploy when two squad members are close by or that Casper can‘t deploy a drone in a smoke because of whatever reason.
-I agree that the specialist having names and identities damaged effect to let the soldiers blend into battle. Now it gets more obvious that the same character models appear over and over again.
-No “Assist count as a kill” anymore.
-You also feel BF2042 identity crisis. Some map reworks and especially everything after Season 4 was like EA Dice saying: „Hey players, yes Battlefield 2042 is total garbage! And because of that we gonna remove those features that made this game special or change them to more normal mechanics!“. C‘mon we can all agree that BF2042 did not completed all their expectations but still it had new cool and fun things. Yes some people wanted a more classical BF experience but they would hate the new mechanics anyway.
-One thing that no one really talked about: Battlefield 2042 doesn‘t feel like a worthy next step after Battlefield 5. Many changes that were good in the previous title, didn‘t returned and it sucks. The ping spot instead of a 3D spot was great and way less annoying.

Those were all my points I have in mind.

TL;DR : Yes Battlefield 2042 had a rough start and yes BF2042 is not that polished like the other entries, but I liked this game… hell I love Battlefield 2042! From all games I played since Battlefield 4, this the Battlefield with my most playtime. Yes, and it‘s because the most ""battlefieldest"" game of all. If Battlefield for you means large scale combat, then Battlefield 2042 did and focused on exactly that. Great game, totally recommend it!",True,0,46016

But over these last few weeks leading up to BF6, I've had terrible crashes, in one specific spot. When you load into the main menu, your character spawns in and does a cool badass turn and walk towards the camera. Wow, so fucking cool and sick. Except... if you're like me, your game will crash as soon as they start walking to the camera. This isn't just an issue of it crashing when you load in--when you finish a match, you get a screen that shows you all of your unlocks from the last match. When you click through that menu and return to the main menu, your game crashes as your character walks at the camera. Doesn't matter how long you're in that initial rewards menu; you crash when the character model loads in. Awesome.

To make matters worse, this game relies on the tumor that is the EA desktop client. For NO fucking reason. And sometimes, the EA desktop client will simply refuse to connect to their servers, even though you're able to connect online with LITERALLY EVERY OTHER APP on your computer, even as you're in Discord VC with other people in the SAME STATE who are connecting to the EA servers no problem. Reset the EA app? Clear the EA app cache? Restart your PC? Uninstall the EA app and reinstall? Verify integrity of game files? UNINSTALL THE ENTIRE GAME AND REINSTALL IT? NOTHING WORKS. What does get it working again? Re-launching it for the 100th time, having changed NOTHING AT ALL, after trying to get in the game that you PAID MONEY FOR for 30 minutes... I'm not exaggerating when I say that the EA app may be the absolute worst piece of trash software I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, and I used to play League of Legends.

If Battlefield 6 requires you to launch through the EA app, I legitimately may request a refund. It is so shit.

This game's gameplay is fine. The maps are bland and insanely open. The time-to-kill of the gunplay is way too fast, guns are way too accurate at long range with full-auto fire, and helicopters are OP, frequently unkillable.

Unfortunately, the squad-based system limits coordination in larger public matches. With squads capped at four players, organizing as a single, cohesive team is nearly impossible. This restriction takes away the large-scale teamwork that Battlefield has always been known for.

As a group of ten friends, we can’t all join the same match like we could in past Battlefield titles. Unless we use custom Portal servers, we’re forced to split up, which really hurts the experience. Sadly, it seems this design direction may continue into Battlefield 6, which is disappointing for fans who miss the franchise’s classic large-squad coordination.

[h1] Battlefield 2042 - It's improvements over the years doesn't stop it from being easily the worst Battlefield of all time. [/h1]

[h2] Pros: [/h2]

. They have made some positive improvements since it's launch in 2021. I think the way they integrated the traditional class system into the operator system that this game introduced is a great idea, giving more roles outside the basic Recon, Support, Engineer and Assault and creating some more diverse gameplay.

. The Portal mode is also a nice idea; bringing back old maps whilst mixing in weapon loadouts from all eras of Battlefield, such as using weapons from 1942 on a map from Battlefield 3. Or just straight up an old map using loadouts from the game it was from. It creates some interesting matchups that can actually be quite entertaining.


[h2] Cons: [/h2]

. The base game's maps are HORRIBLE. Almost every map is way too big and empty with absolutely no flow or consistency to them. The level terrain makes the maps feel disconnected, and also makes most maps an absolute sniper's paradise. If the enemy team has several decent snipers, then you can forget about having fun.

. The spawns are EVEN WORSE. If the enemy is on an objective that you choose to spawn on, then 9 times out of 10 you will be spawned either way too far away (sometimes even being spawned closer to or on other objectives), or right on top of enemies (which can also happen regardless of where you spawn) leading to worryingly high amounts of spawn killing.

. The weapons and vehicles are horribly unbalanced, especially choppers and snipers. If you have decent players or sweats using either, then they can easily single you out and decimate you regardless of where you are. That and if the enemy team know how to take advantage of the layout and gameplay, then it can lead to unfair and one-sided matches.

. Hazard Zone...a mode so infamously bad EA gave up on it and shut it down, but unfortunately they couldn't be asked to remove the play option from the menu. Pressing the option just softlocks you into an infinite loading screen. Be aware of this if you were this of playing this mode.

. Despite the improvements, this game is still very buggy. Packet loss and lag can be abundant if your PC is doing anything other than running the game (Don't have anything in the background while playing this game). The game is also very susceptible to crashing. Hackers are also a problem in this game.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,206010894,"This game is a tried-and-true aim down the sights FPS. And its the battlefield format. I personally had a lot of fun in this game as someone with above average FPS skill, who was trying to both aim train and also warm myself up for the battlefield format in preperation for the new game. 

The battlefield format is not something I am the most experienced in; I put around 250 hours into Battlefield 1 over the course of that games lifespan and it was really good! There was a lot of variety and the class system made sense. That game had its own host of issues with EA's notoriously bad publishing and arthouse descisions when it comes to monitization. Overall, it had some great and bad maps, along with great and bad guns. Vehicles were kickass and it felt like there was a ton to do.

Battlefield 2042 is the 2022 installment of the battlefield franchise - the modern adaptation of the battlefield format. This game still boasts a full $60 pricetag, for a really lackluster overall game experience. I put in the majority of my hours into this game in 2025, after all 7 seasons worth of content for BF2042. I had lots of fun farming clueless players with some of the most overpowered weapons I've ever used in any online FPS. The AM40 outclasses basically every other AR and SMG in class, The Rorsch-mk4 is a hitscan, no drop-off railgun weapon which makes snipers and sightlines basically irrelevant, from any distance, which is still mind blowing to revisit. There was offline modes where you can earn XP and custom made AFK XP lobbies for people who don't want to play this game. The maps were shitty and there wasn't a lot of them. I would rather gouge my eyes out with a shard of hard plastic than play one round of Conquest on any of them. Breakthrough was a ton of fun because every map is a gradual hill where overwhelming force can only be done from the top of said hill. At least there is plenty of combo kills to get, attachments to grind out, calling cards to achieve, and any arrangement of situations you can put yourself in with no class weapon restrictions and the limited combo of vehicles and aircrafts available on some maps.

This game is rated at 48% overall reviews. If this game were free, I'd say that is completely disagreeable. For what you get though, the only things that kept me playing this game were its kind of strange weapon unlock system, the extremely overly long battle pass, and the brief potent hits of dopamine I get from frying an entire platoon of people in one of the very poorly designed chokepoints. I dunno. It's mid. But it's kind of good. Its good mids. Avoid this if you are replaying the entire battlefield franchise. If you were stuck on an island, and you had this game, it wouldn't be the worst. As a modern multiplayer experience this is another disappointment in a line of them.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205975239,"This Battlefield was the biggest disappointment since BF existed. I bought it Day 1 for 99€ on PS5 because I expected special treatment as a hardcore fan. And I got some great unlocks for one or two seasons. But it were the seasons of bugs and broken sepcialists. So I had some fun in the beginning but it went down quickly. 

I hate the FOMO Battle Pass! 
I have like 10h per week to play. Enough to progress through the weekly missions to get the unlocks I want or even need. But I don't want to spend my preciuos time playing a game in a way I don't even want to play it. There are other games I want to play also, so curse you FOMO mechanics! 
But important specialist and vehicle unlocks need you to complete some BS tedious weekly missions just to get some points because grinding these points with regular gameplay takes forever. 

Yes you had the chance afterwards to unlock them with some missions like in BF3 but I never understood when they released because I was long gone and there were even weekly missions you couldn't complete because you hadn't unlocked the weapons in the battle pass before.

I liked the BF3 system better. Yes you had to grind through some objectives that were tedious but you could do it whenever you felt like it and after that you had your unlock. 
I played the BF6 beta, had fun and have high hopes so I tried BF2042 again for 3,99 to get the unlocks for BF6 and get some BF Fun. But nope. It will forever be the worst.

Will I buy BF6? Yes because I am sure I will get at least 100hs of fun out of it if it is equal to the beta and that is enough for me.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205958221,"After 95 Hours, It's Time for a Review

The game is now in a state it should have been at release.
It needs some work and balancing nothing major, but sadly it's at the end of its supported time

Maps:

Many maps need some work done, nothing major, but adding things here and there. 

Some of the big maps that were reworked aren't enough; they just shrunk the map and added some extra crates and other stuff to hide behind. That's a good start, but not enough.

In the map rotation are some BF5 maps, which worked well in BF5, a game with fewer explosions and a mechanic to rebuild defenses. An airfield with lots of barracks is now, after 20% of the game, just an open field with a capture point but no defenses.

Balancing:

Weapon: weapons balancing is mostly fine; some are a bit OP, but nothing major. Only snipers need some bullet drop and suppressed status when under fire. 

Vehicles: Tanks and other cars some weeks ago vehicles were nearly unkillable and had an extreme amount of firepower; now they have an extreme amount of firepower and are made out of paper. When you are in a tank, you can easily kill 10 people, but when someone has a rocket launcher, you are dead.

Hacker:

Wallhacks: are not easy to prove because of all the spotting gadgets, but I'm often in situations where it's really strange how they know where people are, because in my team they often don't like to spot people, and they have need really good teammates that are helping them.

Aimbot: I've seen more than once people on my team aim and look at enemies behind walls or above them on the roof when they were not spotted.

Performance:
Grafik und PC: its good nothing bad here
Connection: mostly good

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205907695,"As a long-time Battlefield fan, I can recommend this one, but I can't justify buying it all full price. The game still lacks polish in numerous areas, and it does not hit the highs of past entries, but I have had plenty of fun in the various modes.

Overall, I would rate it around a 6.8 out of 10. Here's why:

Where it shines:
The maps are large and visually impressive, and when the chaos kicks off it really does feel like a classic Battlefield game. Explosions, vehicles, and squads wrestling for the objective still create those unforgettable “only in Battlefield” moments. Gunplay feels pretty good, and levolutions are still here. Playing with friends absolutely elevates the experience. 

My main critiques:

Maps: The maps are vast and gorgeous, but sometimes they feel a bit too big for their own good. Certain modes, especially Breakthrough, suffer from balance issues. Some maps are super fun whether you are attacking or defending, but others are so lopsided that it is better to just leave and find a different match.

Specialists: On paper they sound cool, but Battlefield has never been about operators. It is about squads, teamwork, and chaos. You do not need hero characters for that, and any older Battlefield attests to this. I would rather be nameless machine-gunner #72 than a specialist with a gadget that anyone could use.

Class system: Letting every class use any weapon waters down the identity. You could argue it is flexible, but when I can sit back in spawn as Support with a sniper, ammo box, and shield, it just feels cheesy.

No campaign: The entire story is drip-fed through cinematics and codex entries. Killing off Pac, a beloved BF4 character, in a short film before the game even starts was weak. His death felt meaningless and lazy, especially when you consider he was with you for almost the entire campaign of BF4.

If none of these are deal-breakers for you, grab it on sale. There is still lots of fun to be had blowing stuff up with friends, just do not expect it to live up to the Battlefield legacy.",True,1,40587

☢️‹‹ Gameplay ›› [10/10]
‎ ‎Battlefield 2042 has a good and smooth gameplay. Like all classic Battlefields, the Conquest and Breakout modes are very entertaining and have maintained their identity well. In addition, it has an interesting and somewhat mining mode called Hazard Zone, which is also entertaining in its own right. The variety of weapons is also good, but one of the negative points of this game is having different classes that take a while to get used to because previous versions of Battlefield only used four classes, which I think the old versions are better in this regard. But this cannot be considered too negative, but changing the structure of the game, which is popular for its simplicity and realism, is not very interesting.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Graphics ›› [8/10]
‎ ‎The graphics have always been beautiful in different versions of Battlefield and have always had a realistic atmosphere. In Battlefield 2042, they have also tried to maintain a realistic and logical environment in the future, and in this respect it has been good. However, having simple textures in some environments and having weak destructibility made this game less than expected. It must be said that one of the signatures of Battlefield is the destructibility of the environments and their effects on the gameplay, but unfortunately it performs poorly in this case. Of course, there are natural disasters in this game such as hailstorms and hurricanes, but these are not very interesting.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Sound & Music ›› [6/10]
‎ ‎The music in this game is not very interesting. Just a few sound effects that you hear from time to time, even one is not that impressive. If you listen to the music of Battlefield 3, 4 or 1, you will fully understand the weakness of this version of the game.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Story & Narrative ›› [0/10]
‎ ‎As a fan of the Battlefield franchise, I was really disappointed that this version didn't have a campaign or story mode.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ World and Atmosphere ›› [8/10]
‎ If I were to talk about the atmosphere of the game, it is really good and acceptable. The game environments are very well designed and large, and since the game is set in the future, we see logical and realistic structures (unlike Call of Duty). The game's weather is natural and the light colors of the environments are well preserved. I personally like the rainy and gloomy environments very much, which are well done in this case.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ AI & Challenge ›› [10/10]
‎ If you have played the custom modes or the portal mode (with AI), you will realize how good AI is in this game and it is kind of enjoyable because it gives the feeling of real players and performs exactly as you expect. Regarding the challenges of the game, I must say that it has challenging and completely fair challenges and completing them is quite enjoyable, whether to get cards or unlock attachments and guns or battle passes.
‎ 
☢️‹‹ Performance & Technical ›› [8/10]
‎ The game has good performance and can be played with relatively old systems to some extent. But the game has some bugs that apparently have never been fixed and will never be fixed. For example, when playing, you will definitely encounter lag during animations or when structures are destroyed. Some of the game's animations have problems and of course there is also getting stuck somewhere on the map and sometimes it is really annoying. Most of the time, there is a problem with loading the game's textures and it takes a long time to load.
‎

The gun-play feels good, squad play can still deliver that classic Battlefield chaos and some of the updates genuinely improved the experience. It still has its flaws, like weak map design and questionable balance but if you go in with tempered expectations, there’s fun to be had. It’s not the Battlefield we wanted but it’s no longer the joke it started as.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205712231,"This game is almost good. It's infuriating, because most of the problems stem from the idiotic decision to design the entire game around Specialists and throw out the original class system back at launch. Why EA thought a hero shooter formula was a good fit for a game with 32 players per team is completely beyond me, but it feels like they wanted to prioritize the extraction royale Hazard Zone mode over the rest of the game at first, which flopped immediately so instead we were just left with the traditional Battlefield style scale balanced with a 4 player squad extraction royale in mind.

Granted, the game is in a far better state it launched in and a lot of the issues have been at least mitigated or addressed in some way, but there are still some serious problems. Gadget variety is pretty terrible since every specialists brings their own gadget to the first gadget slot, which isn't interchangeable at all. Want to run AT mines and a launcher? Too bad, you can only do that with Lis and have to deal with a super unmaneuverable TV guided missile launcher, the other two engineer specialists simply have turrets meant to counter infantry. A lot of the more powerful gadgets simply don't get used because the specialists they're tied to aren't fun to play or can't compete with the passives of another specialist.

Vehicle balance is pretty horrendous since the majority of conquest maps give both teams 2 Jets, 2 Attack helicopter, and a transport helicopter, and vehicle respawn is on a per player basis so you're just getting spammed by air for the entire match. Ground vehicles are oppressively mobile and omnipresent, and people don't seem particularly interested in coordinating AT launcher fire to counter them instead just preferring to run and gun against other infantry players, which was always a problem in BF but reached new heights with this game.

Player visibility across the board is pretty bad and oftentimes you'll just have to rely on looking for the orange dorito above people's heads to tell if someone's just being a bush wookie. And even if you do see someone, both teams use the exact same specialists and skins so you can't just tell at a glance what side someone is on without seeing their red lite-brites or seeing their red name above their head, which can be a problem. Which is funny because the infamous bots used to fill out servers have defined faction appearances and class designs which look a lot more interesting and cool than any of the basic default specialist skins. But apparently DICE thought we didn't want to play as soldiers, just zoomer mercenaries and old folks straight out of the retirement home.

Most guns are very low recoil and have very little spread so getting caught out by someone usually means very quick death even from a distance. Maps are far too open even after the passes made to tighten them up and add more cover, leaving you with classic Battlefield situations where sniper sightlines can just dominate the entire map and leave huge stretches of ground watched by vehicles that infantry just can't do anything about. Smaller scale modes like TDM and Rush suffer from poor map layouts that have the exact same issue of just too much open ground watched over by rooftops and long sightlines.

And then of course, no campaign. That's not a dealbreaker but you're undeniably just getting less content than other games that have some sort of singleplayer campaign on offer. All the lore is explained through calling cards (of all things) and a codex buried in the menu that nobody reads, and whatever voiceover both teams announcers give at the start of a match. And the story itself on display, what little there is, isn't very good. Blackburn is a eugenicist tech magnate obsessed with making cyborgs or something (????? how the fuck do you go from stopping New York being nuked to that?), the factions from 2142 are being established with the Mandate of Nations being the new EU after the old EU collapsed and lead to the No-Pats, and the Thousand Petals Coalition being the early incarnation of the PAC. The No-Pats themselves have basically formed Outer Heaven out of South Africa. It's just a mid story told in the worst way possible.

But do I think this game is good? It's complicated. I don't think it's terrible but it's... meh. Especially after experiencing the BF6 Open Beta, the drastic difference in quality is uncanny. 

This game got so many things wrong and it's sad because in my personal opinion, this is the most interesting concept of a Battlefield game that isn't BF1. Sometimes the game is actually fun to play but most of the time, it feels like a slog. ESPECIALLY because most of the maps are awful. Most of the 64 player maps feel like it was made for 128 people, and the 128 people maps feel like 256 people maps. The maps are just WAY too big. And even if you do get to the enclosed maps like REDACTED (which is my favorite map on this game), the game turns into a glorified Call of Duty which isn't too much of an issue? The bigger issue is that this is a Battlefield game and for a Battlefield game, this is a disappointment.

I can't in full confidence say that this game is worth your time and I feel like if it wasn't for the BF6 exclusive cosmetics, I would feel like I wasted my life which to an extent I did.

Le jeu s’est beaucoup amélioré depuis son lancement catastrophique. Les bugs sont largement corrigés, le gameplay est plus fluide, et le mode Portal permet des expériences très fun.

Les combats à grande échelle sont toujours aussi intenses, surtout avec les véhicules et les effets météo dynamiques.

MAIS : les cartes restent parfois trop grandes/vastes, le feeling des armes n'est pas au niveau des anciens BF pour certains, et le système de spécialistes peut diviser.

En promo, ça vaut le coup. Plein tarif ? À toi de voir selon ton niveau de tolérance aux défauts.

Gunplay still feels good but the sliding movement stuff is a little annoying to deal with given the current date of how most FPS games use movement mechanics. 

Vehicles are pretty fun to use and the open class weapons make it nice to use a medic support w/ an LMG.

The specialists are somewhat shoehorned in, I like the idea of having certain characters with special gear but it does get pretty dumb at times due to how certain maps are done. 

Not a bad battlefield game, worth the three Euro for when was on sale. Done the battlepass on time and it scratched my BF itch until BF6 drops soon.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205504327,"TLDR: Good game but isn't very realistic with it's skins and gameplay ideas, still good for 6 cad

This game is just okay.

It isn't too good nor bad, but it's just in the middle.

Before I start though, I wanna say that I'm actually fine with most of the stuff I'm going to talk about, since it won't really matter in real games. I just want to alert to the idea of what they were trying to and do and what they did do and how it kind of killed the games atmosphere and idea in general.

CAMPAIGN:
uhhhh
there isn't one

Multiplayer:
This is the only gamemode there is for 2042. That doesn't mean its bad just because its MP only, but anyways.
The guns are actually fine, there is a lot of attachments for different scenarios and combined with the quick attachment changing thing  you can use the same gun for a variety of different scenarios. Is it realistic? Not really, but it is helpful.
2042 also brings new modes like hazard zone which i haven't played but I assume its like EFT or MW22s DMZ. It also brings 128 player conquest, which is just conquest but with double the people. 
Probably my biggest issue with the game is the operators. What the FUCK were they thinking adding this. After having a perfect formula with BF3, 4, 1 and 5 they throw it out the window for some reason. It's not even like they were copying anyone significant since the popular games in 2021 were COD (MW19, BOCW, Vanguard) and fortnite, NEITHER having operators (that had different skills). If anyone, they copied BO3 and 4, but 3 was 2015 when they had 4 and hardline and 4 was around the BF1 and 5 era. 
Anyways, there's operators but to add salt to the wound you can use ANY gun on ANY class. Tbf this was the thing with every other game but at least they were shared weapons like SMGS and stuff, not any gun for anyone. The operators though I will admit are useful in their own ways, but I don't know about some grappling hook or wingsuit bullshit (I wish I was joking but these are deadass in the game), like this isn't Just Cause 3 (peak game btw buy it)

Then the skins, oh my lord the skins. They have:
COD type bullshit skins (at least not nicki manaj but whatever) 
Stupid looking gun skins
And just in general too much colors. 
I would much rather play an unknown soldier, not some celebrity operator with superpowers to not die. I would even accept the aforementioned weird gadgets if we could use them with their respective classes and without a specific operator. The operators don't even look cool or anything but they sound so fucking annoying.

With all of that said, this isn't a bad game. It's actually a pretty good game if you don't listen to the operators and don't cry about the gadgets like I did (I actually love the gadgets it just feels unrealistic). You can probably ignore the weird op skins too, but again it's just about the idea that they did this stuff.

I heard of BF6 beta, installed it and were in for 3 days of absolute onslaught. I loved it. 
So much so, I figured I wanted to check out something else before BF6 release. I found BF2042 having the largest active player base at the time. Got lucky, it was on Steam on sale. 
I love it, its fun, it's what doctor ordered. I like the specialisms, the gadgets, the combat approach, being able to use ground and air vehicles. Following the news in the analog world I became aware of valiant Bradleys, and St.Javelins few years ago already... having discovered it in a game was a treat! More importantly it got me back into the frenzy of CoD:MW2 -- endorphins.
I would have loved to see this game to be more realistic, more gory, with enemies laid waste on the battlefield uncleared.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205457058,"while there is a lot about this game that is quite terrible, it does offer a unique experience that we'll never get again in a battlefield game.

the maps are pretty afwull, especially the open maps with plenty of space for snipers to just use a sniper rifle with bullets that have no dropoff and kill you from 750 meters away, these large maps also facilitate many very powerful vehicles like the blackbird helicopter and many weapons platform tanks and surprisingly few ways to fight them if supported properly.

the heroes are a terrible idea, it creates such a powergap, some heroes are just far better then others because they can do more on their own, the girl with the wingsuit and rain grenade outshines all other assaults, the recon with the hacking thing is just straight up more useful then the anti-targeting/tracking or little scout bot that only works for your squad.
for medics the girl with the healing gun is rediculously better then all others, and for the engineers i think the bald black guy with the deployable minigun is the strongest.
as you can see i don't remember any of their names.

on the vehicles, there's too many at once on any given map, if anyone is  good at flying the helicopters there is just no way to be rid of them, AA rocket launchers are a joke because a lot of heli's have re-chargeable flares, there's no limit to how many times they can just recharge the ability, and if push comes to shove, fly low and avoid any and all rockets while still mowing down hundreds without risk, yes i'm very salty  about blackbirds coming up next to my ear and whispering how fucked i am as they proceed to pinpoint accuracy shoot me with rockets, i tried it myself but i'm not an alien so the controls didn't make sense to me. i'm sure the guys who are great at flying them are having a great time though.

despite all that i am having a decent time with it, i got the game for 3 bucks so i definitely got my money's worth and has soured my experience with battlefield to the point where battlefield 6 will feel like such an improvement i'll be over the moon when i get to touch that, at this point i can no longer recommend the game as a lack of singleplayer content deems this game completely absolete in a week.",False,0,2826

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205445082,"This game is truly a mixed bag. Overall, I feel that the game is just flawed at a fundamental level.

First the good. The ability to customize your weapon while on the ground is awesome. Being able to change your weapon's attachments for close and far range engagements made the game more dynamic and fluid. Portal is a really great feature that they are expanding on in BF6. Being able to play my favorite BF3, BF4, and Bad Company 2 maps is just chief’s kiss. Lastly, and more personally, the easter eggs and love they gave the game with its final battlepass made me believe there are still some people who really care over at DICE despite all the crap we give them (and the crap they do to themselves in their work culture).

The bad, however, far outweighs the good. Gone are classes that have been a core to Battlefield, replaced by a range of characters that was merely made to fulfill a marketing diversity checkbox. Gone are weapons being exclusive to said classes, replaced with a half-assed class perk system that you’d hardly even notice is a thing. For some god-awful reason, they separated vehicle upgrades by faction and there are technically THREE of them: US, Russia, and personal. Gone is the destruction system to be replaced by 128 player matches which did not add to the experience whatsoever. 

Finally, XP farming for their battlepass is a fundamental issue. Why play assault at all when you can just play recon and rack up points with spotting assists? Why play engineer when you can run around reviving and giving people supplies as support? Why play at all when you can just join an AFK server and gain the points needed while you play other, more worthwhile games? This goes back to vehicle upgrades in that you must spend HOURS to upgrade your vehicles and that is just for one faction. If you want a SPECIFIC faction, you’re better off making your own portal server with rules that allow you to switch sides (thank God Dice allows you to do this for free).

So no, I do not recommend this game. BF6 will have many of the problems listed here delt with, but you can bet it’s not going to be a smooth ride and that is just part of the journey at this point.",False,0,5242

If you managed to get it on sale for $3 like I did, it's a pretty fun time waster, but I would definitely still say this is the weakest Battlefield game. It is infinitely better than it was on launch but still not amazing. If they put it on sale for $3 again or similar price, I would definitely say it's worth the price of admission. Though, with 6 right around the corner, I wouldn't be surprised if the playerbase for this game tanks rapidly, as I imagine most people playing right now are either grinding out the BF6 battlepass unlocks or are similar to me, new players from the $3 sale.

Very Call Of Duty styled weapon handling and gunplay. Recoil is negligible on most guns compared to BF norms, snipers are insanely powerful and easy to use, and Carbines are missing entirely. Pistols feel like shit other than the Magnums. 

Operator abilities range from hilariously broken to nearly useless, and battles can swing very fast as a result of a single operator. Falck in particular can revive nearly instantly, heal herself like Assaults can, and revives at full HP regardless of defib charge, meaning that you can gun down an entire group of enemies and then watch them all get right back up fully ready within 10 seconds. Meanwhile Paik has a detection gadget that is worse than the T-UGS that any recon can equip and reveals her own position, alongside a passive ability that is basically useless.

Map design is questionable at best, with very weird sightlines and strangely cluttered areas mixed with nearly barren ones. A lot of individual objectives seem well designed but overall map layouts feel very off as a returning player.

Portal is really cool but not worth the price of entry and it can be hard to find servers populated with modes you would actually want to play. Most portal servers are either crazy one-shot-kill super hardcore servers where if you step out of cover for a second you get nailed from miles away, or are weird EXP grinding servers where you can't actually play the game. Maybe if this game hadn't been such a disaster on launch Portal would have taken off more?

Wide open maps with no cover or destruction.
A specialist system that nobody asked for, and was crammed in to fit a class system that is still horrible with obvious best in slot picks.
Weapon balancing that makes Hardline go weak at the knees.
Lore that might as well be from another game that is much better than this shit.
Worst of all, probably one of the most gut-wrenching renditions of the Battlefield theme, along with it's own exquisite selection of wet farts for music.

Battlefield has never been the kind of series that justifies putting your PC on the line, and it certainly isn’t now.

That’s not a flex—it’s a confession that your “solution” doesn’t solve anything.

And here’s the kicker: by forcing Secure Boot, you didn’t stop the cheaters—you punished the legitimate players. You created risk for the people who actually wanted to play fair, while the people breaking your rules carried on anyway. That’s not security, that’s incompetence.

So let’s be clear: Secure Boot didn’t protect your game, it didn’t protect your players, and it didn’t protect your reputation.

Seriously, the desync is so bad it makes me want to rip my hair out. The game shows a ping of 30ms almost all the time, yet I'm still getting killed while clearly behind cover.

Your team rarely plays the objective and is too scared to push 90% of the time. Solo queueing is unbearable. With the way health and gunplay works, unless you catch someone off-guard or you're in the top 1%, you’re likely not clutching anything.

For some reason, shotguns can kill you from 50 meters away. I've lost count of how many times I’ve started shooting someone with a marksman rifle, only to get one-tapped in the head by buckshot. It’s ridiculous. I’m so sick of FPS games turning shotguns into jack-of-all-trades weapons. COD is guilty of this too—arguably even worse. Shotguns shouldn’t dominate most gunfights. If I’m shooting someone at range, I should be able to outgun them. But right now, you can’t.

The enemies you fight are unbearable. It’s always a squad of snipers with 1,000+ hours, or someone in a helicopter with the same. It’s rare to find a match where you’re not sweating every second just to stay competitive.

This game is also missing so many core features from previous Battlefield titles. There is absolutely no reason I should have to requeue after every match. You grind for 10-20 minutes depending on the mode, and then you’re forced to sit in a queue again before starting all over.

Players don’t even play their roles properly. Snipers run around like they’re using assault rifles, and assault players are too scared to push past the first objective. Medics rarely heal or revive; your squad will watch you bleed out and run right past you like you don’t exist.

The map variety is pathetic. Maybe it’s because I don’t have the Ultimate Edition and there are DLC maps I’m missing, but after 20 hours, I feel like I’ve played the same five maps over and over. And yes, I know there’s more content in Portal—but I’m playing Battlefield 2042 to play 2042. If I wanted Battlefield 3, I’d just go play Battlefield 3.

Overall, this is by far the worst Battlefield game ever made. The HUD color scheme is ugly—it looks like a mobile game with all the bright light-blue highlights. The guns don’t feel right; it often feels like I'm firing non-lethal rounds. There are a million attachments for each gun, most of which offer little to no noticeable difference. There are like three different suppressors, compensators, and grips, and I can't tell them apart except for the visuals. Also, thermal scopes don’t work through smoke—which, correct me if I’m wrong, is the entire point of a thermal scope.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205314656,"[h1] The Good, The Bad and The Worry for BF6 [h1]

BF2042 is a rough ride. At launch, it was miserable — constant disconnects, unbearable lag, and kills that felt like finding the Holy Grail. I walked away, especially when the game leaned into live-service trends like battle passes and seasonal grinds. Recently I gave it another shot during double XP weekends, hoping it had improved before BF6. It hasn’t. I still don’t enjoy it, and I’m worried that some of its worst elements might bleed into the next game.

[h2] The Good [h2]

Visuals & Maps: The maps are beautiful, even if some blend together.

Portal: A creative mode that allows for unique war sims and scenarios, often as engaging as full-priced titles.

Weapons: A large arsenal, letting you find a favorite (though balance issues make many weapons pointless).

Weather Effects: Tornadoes and sandstorms are gimmicky but fun, sometimes more enjoyable than the game itself.

[h2] The Bad [h2]

Map Design: Most maps are far too big, a sniper’s paradise. For AR and SMG players, it feels awful. Even at a 70 FOV, spotting enemies is a blurry mess.

Portal Abuse: Once a highlight, it’s now plagued with AFK grind lobbies and restricted XP, making it pointless.

Community: Toxic, camp-heavy, and more like COD than the Battlefield of old. Veterans dominate with “meta builds,” leaving newcomers frustrated.

Squad Play: Playing with friends is unreliable; one of you often gets kicked mid-match.

Music: Grating and out of place, distracting more than immersive.

 [h2] Why I’m Worried About BF6 [h2] 

Most fans already know the issues with specialists and progression, so I’ll focus elsewhere:

Customization: Battle passes make everyone look the same. Let players personalize their characters.

Map & Spawn Design: Both BF2042 and the BF6 beta suffer from poor spawn points and oversized, empty-feeling maps. “Big” doesn’t have to mean “vacant.” Give us large, but meaningful, maps with good flow and fewer cheap deaths.

BF2042 had potential but squandered it with poor design and live-service baggage. I can only hope BF6 learns from these mistakes.",False,1,2521

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205293745,"I started playing BF games with BF1942, at launch. I know that on Steam, it becomes cool to hate on games that are hated on by others - whether to get rewards or whatever from others. Having seen the reviews for BF2042, I had very low expectations.

But, at $3, and with a Road to BF6 event for free, what was there to loose?

Simply put, I had a lot of fun. I finished the BF6 event, and enjoyed my journey there. After years of patches, and content updates, and changes - the final state of BF2042 is actually a lot of fun. Honestly I enjoyed it more than BF1 or BFV - neither of which did I personally find enjoyable, especially BFV, which has nothing do with WWII.

I especially like the option to just play against AI if you so choose. Sometimes you just want to sit back and relax, and playing against the AI is a great way to do that, especially with others.

",True,0,3661
Battlefield 2042,1517290,205273118,"Battlefield 2042, like its predecessors, has always been a sandbox-like FPS. All the gadgets, vehicles, and their abilities allow each player to approach the battle in different ways with a lot of freedom and this is what, for me, separates the series from other FPS like CSGO or CoD. The modern vehicles add a lot of variety and chaos to matches and are quite well balanced, as they can influence the tide of battle without being too OP or having too much health. A tank without infantry escort, just like in real life, won’t last long.

Players move really fast, opening up many tactical opportunities, but there are drawbacks. By making the pacing so fast, you get that adrenaline rush from the game, but it also means you may be attacked from any direction. This translates to a lot more deaths and what often feels like a meatgrinder; you spawn, rush to the point, die 15 seconds later, and start spamming the respawn button again. 
Also. some maps are also way too big, and both teams end up spreading everywhere, turning the entire play area into a no man’s land.

Unfortunately, the game practically removed environmental destruction except for a few large-scale events. That, at least for me, was a big selling point of the previous titles, not only is it fun to “blow things up,” but it also adds strategy by opening new paths or exposing camped enemies.

I instead really liked Portal and the custom server modes. With Portal, you can play with content from many older BF titles while also creating custom rules for your own matches. 
For example, you can invite a friend into your private lobby and play a co-op PvE match set in WWII with uniforms and vehicles from Battlefield V or even the Vietnam DLC from Bad Company 2. It’s not at the same level of a Halo forge but offers a lot of possibilities.

[h3]Conclusions[/h3]
The game was an incomplete, broken mess at launch, and many features like QoL and Portal were added later, making a lot of people (myself included) change their minds. That’s why I strongly advise not to be afraid of its bad online reputation and just give it a go, maybe with a friend, since it’s often on sale.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205215315,"This should be a ""mixed"" review, but steam doesn't have a mixed rating for individual reviews. 

Let me preface this by saying that I actually hate pvp shooters, and the only way I'd really play one is if a friend joined me on one. So maybe take what I say with a grain of salt, especially since i first played this long after the garbage launch this game had. What brought me to this game ironically enough was both the sale of it being for only 3 dollars, and watching gameplay videos of the BF6 beta and seeing how much people praised it, so i decided to pick this up. I've actually never played a BF game before so this is actually my first endeavor into this series. First impression of this game was weirdly good, for a 3 dollar game discounted from 60. Several hours later, the biggest problems with this game started sticking out like soar thumbs. The biggest one being, the god awful map design that makes it easy for someone to equip snipers and spawn kill everyone from the enemy team spawning in from a somewhat far but close location. The other big problem is the borderline nonexistent methods of countering the tanks and fighter jets, worsened by just how straight up OP they both are. The only counters are the anti tank mines that some of the tanks have, and the RPGs that the engineer class has, and even then it's not a guarantee to bring ether of them down with them, so it just leads to someone with a tank easily shreading a group from an enemy team to bits. Being constantly faced with those 2 problems in most matches simply lead to me deciding I've had enough of this game and decided to uninstall it and just not bother with the free battle pass. Which is such a shame because I actually liked the gameplay loop that mixes together co op and pvp togehter that this game (and other BFs) have. I put in 30 hours in total, so I did end up getting my 3 dollars worth of it, and that is probably all what this experience is worth, not 60. To end this off, this game did one good thing, which was entice me to want to try the older BF games the next time they go on sale. Let's just hope EA/DICE learned their lesson from this game and NEVER makes a game as bad as this one ever again.",False,0,1835

I originally bought the game on PlayStation back in 2021. While I managed to put in around 70 hours and had some fun, it was impossible to ignore how disappointing it felt. For a franchise that’s so close to my heart, it was clear that the game lacked many of the qualities that made earlier entries shine.

Recently, I decided to reinstall it thanks to a discount and some unlocks for BF6. To my surprise, much has been improved, and I ended up sinking another 60 hours into it.

The game still feels a little soulless and generic at times, but there’s definitely fun to be had. One of my favorite aspects is the sense of scale that comes with 128 player Conquest. The addition of weekly missions pushes me to experiment with different weapons and tactics, which keeps things fresh. Text and voice chat have finally been added, and some genuinely great maps too. Plus, the cringey voice lines? Gone.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,205089926,"Now that I've finally finished the free pass and unlocked all the skins for Battlefield 6, I can honestly say without a doubt that while the game is definitely better than when it first released...that's not by much.

Lets start with one of the worst aspects. The net code. You are guaranteed to get shot around corners constantly, shots will often go right through enemies (as if their hitbox is non-existent), or sometimes it feels like it takes an entire mag to kill one enemy. That works both ways though. Sometimes enemies put an entire mag in you and you shoot like 5 bullets and kill them instantly. The amount of times I've eliminated enemies who were around a corner already and no longer in my line of sight is CRAZY.

The operators are dumb, their powers are even dumber. The irony that this game takes place in 2042 and is for some reason far more futuristic than Battlefield 2142 that came out in 2006 but is somehow in the same universe makes ZERO sense. I feel like a good 80% of the abilities are just made to annoy you. Dozer's shield, Paik's wallhack, Boris's sentry, Crawford's deployable turret that has infinite ammo (but can overheat and cool down quick). Funniest operator's ability is Casper and his drone. Talk about untested. The drone's hitbox is massive for such a tiny drone. Its hilarious.

I think the only real fun I had in the game is the phantom easter eggs and playing with friends because they enjoy it and its quality time to spend with them. Playing this game alone is torture. The biggest blessing was uninstalling this off my drive permanently and I can guarantee once BF6 releases, most players will not look to come back to BF2042.",False,0,4709
Battlefield 2042,1517290,205087352,"Genuinely the worst Battlefield game ever made. (Battlefield Hardline runs circles around this game)
All of my playtime on this steaming pile of shit has been to unlock items for Battlefield 6, and it has honestly been a nightmare.
I purchased this game well over a year ago for $2.50 and played less than 1 hour at that time, only to realize that the game was complete shit. And that was back then. Guess what, nothing has changed.
This game is riddled with bugs, hit registration issues, and flawed mechanics that cause players to feel only frustration and grief. ""Hero"" style playable characters only retract from the typical Battlefield experience. Making unique characters has somehow had the opposite effect and makes everyone feel less important. Most of these characters have borderline useless abilities or they are only applied in very unique scenarios that require specific maps or conditions to be met before they are actually useful.
Battlefield is primarily a multiplayer experience, but without a campaign you are left with only a PvE bot-mode that gives reduced experience and no battlepass progression.
Maps are easily forgettable and lack any kind of interesting or unique features.
Nothing about this game is actually good.
After Battlefield 6 comes out, I think I will either hide this game or remove it entirely from my Steam library to hide my shame that I wasted so much time for such pointless cosmetics IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT GAME.
Nobody is actually going to purchase this game after the time I post this review, but it still deserves to have a low review score.",False,2,2920
Battlefield 2042,1517290,205086012,"TL;DR: Came for the BF6 battle pass, was given no reason to stay. 

Bought it once in '22, refunded it because terrible game. Fast forward to '25, Battlefield 6 beta was great, picked this back up on sale for the BF6 pass (cringe, I know, but I wanted cosmetics and it was on sale for $3. EA knew what they were doing). 

Objectively the worst Battlefield title, I have heard 5 was worse but I never played it so 2042 gets that title instead. I've been around this series since like '08 so I feel like I can judge it pretty well. 

This one is kind of fun and sort of okay here and there but it really just handles like one of those free to play FPS games that were all over the place in the late 2000's early 2010's. You might like that, it's not my thing, and it's not a Battlefield thing. It's like playing a knockoff of itself, kinda like BF:Play4Free except that was free. I could nitpick the problems like the lame gunplay, weak map design, busted spawn system, etc., but there are other reviews that do that a lot better.

I got my pass completed, EA got their cash grab and boosted player count to tell the suits their worst game did great, and they also got an honest review.

Let's start with positive things first, it won't be long lol:

Still Battlefield. Despite all the hate after release and even now, game still offers large-scale warfare, ""only in Battlefield"" moments and vehicle sweats of course. Take 128 players conquest for example, there are mini battles everywhere around the map. A unique experience.

Movement. It's somewhat of an improvement over BF5 and especially over BF1. There are different elements like slide cancel, jump peek and bunny hopping. I would say that you need to master movement to use it efficiently so it adds a skill depth to the game.

Graphics. Although game has forced TAA, it still looks nice even on low settings. DLSS 4 helps a bit with overall TAA blur, but it's still there. But no FSR/XeSS unfortunately.

Gunplay. There are a lot of guns to try out, some of them are definitely meta, but overall it's a balanced experience. TTK is okay, I guess.

Portal. Great idea actually, some of the custom experiences are fun (if you can find them), brings somewhat of a nostalgia playing BC2, BF3 and 1942 maps.

But, there are some negative moments:

Some of the ""future"" gadgets. 
Since I mostly try to flank enemy, I definitely like being spotted by Boris's turret, recon drone or ""Ranger"" the robodog. Nothing is more pleasurable than spending time to shoot them down only to reveal your position and die. Nice.
Mounted Vulcan? That portable minigun with a shield??? Don't even get me started on this.

Pushing using smokes? Forget it. You have thermal sights in the game which you can swap on the go, by the way, and Rao, who can hack you and reveal your entire team around you in the smoke. Oh, let's add Mounted Vulcan spam and Scatter Grenades. You shall not pass!

Some of the maps are great, some of them terrible for infantry. Imagine you have captured an objective close to your base and what do you do now if objective captured by enemy is on different side of the map? You run, maybe for a minute, two or three only to get sniped or killed by vehicle sweat.

Destruction is definitely lacking compared to previous games, it's there, but not really a scale of BF3 or BF4. I would like to see levolution more than weather effects, which do nothing in this game, only get annoying.

Mouse input problem haven't been fixed, it's still there, it's broken and you there's nothing you can do about it. Engine level issue. 

Performance on my end is not really great. Yeah, I get high average FPS, but game suffers from frame pacing issues. I can definitely notice poor 1% lows and frametime dips even on 5700X3D. And no, upgrading to 9800X3D and DRR5 won't fix it, it just how the game works.

Specialists should be gone from Battlefield. There are mechanics in the game that involve using specific specialists to counter them, it really sucks when no one in your team plays Rao for example and I have to play it just to get rid of the annoying vehicle sweats even though I have enough engineers in my team.

I have little to say about sound design, but it's not that good compared to other games. It's fine, I guess, but I've heard better.

Vehicles? Couldn't care less, I'm an infantry enjoyer.

Conclusion: BF2042 has its own pace that similar to BF6 and that's why many people are playing it or have played it. Previous BF games are different in terms of play style, so if you're not a fan of BF1 and BF5, but you still want modern Battlefield, there's nothing else right now. I think that's the main reason why people play it. There's nothing else. 

But if we throw all this aside, it's definitely not the best FPS. BF6 is better in terms of gunplay, sound design and overall vibe, it's pretty evident in comparison.

As a BF player since BC2, not only is this a disgrace to be called ""Battlefield"" but the overall experience is completely lackluster on all fronts. The lac of class lock is an abysmal decision by every aspect of Battlefield's core game play. Nothing feels rewarding because its either easily countered by cheese operator kit's or the game's optimization or lack of. The guns feel no different across the board, the full selection is nice to have if they didn't copy paste every single weapon with a re-skin of a past BF game, the selection is nice. 

Side note, I play BF to fly. With that being said, there is little to no chance of making any significant effort in a game with the selection of all operators in a single game being engineer. Most games, 75%-80% of the team are engineer and that's being generous. Couple that with the amount of AA weapon kits across foot and vehicles, it is borderline impossible to do anything worth while in a rotary wing aircraft. Not only that, the only way to make the aircraft worth anything is by leveling it up. So if you don't want to hop into an AI match to farm bots to level the kit up, you're stuck dumping flares, falling back to cover, rinse repeat without a chance to kill anything, because again, there is zero optimization for any of the weapon's. 

Terrible hit registration for both ground and vehicle weapons. The Apache (all weapon systems minus the gunner) are quite literally useless. Dumping 10 rockets on a single ground operator is overkill. I get that's why there is a gunner and IRL, that's how it is. But don't give the opportunity to also fly/shoot and it be like I'm knitting sweaters and tossing balls of yarn at them. The little bird is really the only rotary wing aircraft that has any value. 

I have never in my life wanted to suck start one of their marshmallow shooters so badly but because of the hit registration, I'm sure it'll rubber band into the ceiling.

(Hero shooter battle royal pee pee poo poo lame ass shit that took years to walk back.) Result being that its best moments are in the games twilight years. Which is a shame because I think this current version of the class system is great and it has some amazing maps, Exposure, Kaleidoscope and Redacted being the standouts for me with some of the most verticality this series has ever had. Exposure especially I will be thinking of for a long time. It also has by far the most vehicle variety in the series. Especially with this recent update adding even more vehicles into the game. 

Battlefield Portal was an amazing Idea that because of the game flopping meant we never got any extensions to it like BC 2 Vietnam being added or 4. The story mode and lore sounded really interesting with returning characters from both 3 and 4 making a comeback like Blackburn for example and then serving as a bridge to 2142 but it was scrapped and reduced to a series of text logs in the compendium.

Even so, I don't think it's very good. Whilst there is still some fun to be had, the sheer abundance of unacceptable core problems sap most of that enjoyment away.

[b]Gunplay[/b]

It's decent, for the most part. I have noticed plenty of instances of terrible hitreg however, particularly when hip firing. If the entirety of my crosshair is overlapping with the enemy player right in front of me, I should expect the majority of my shots to hit. I should not expect to see no hitmarkers and be killed by that enemy after a few seconds of shooting at him.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]

No persistent servers. You have to requeue after every game. This would be fine expect the matchmaking is fairly slow, sometimes taking 3 or 4 minutes to find a game. I also struggled to find matches for close quarters conquest, and I have yet to find a match for 128 player conquest. I was frequently dumped into matches that were either finished or a few seconds away from finishing so I'd have to requeue immediately.

[b]Vehicles[/b]

Being in a vehicle is fun. Not being in a vehicle is not fun. Very difficult to fight back against a moderately skilled chopper pilot, even with guided missiles. I shouldn't need to play Engineer every round just to stand a chance.

[b]Spawning system[/b]

On multiple occasions I came very close to punching and breaking my laptop screen. The spawn system in this game is complete bullshit. I was regularly, CONSISTENTLY spawned in direct line of sight of enemies, sometimes even in the exact spot they were already firing, so that I died before I'd even gained control of my character. This is unacceptable. It doesn't help that choosing where you spawn is extremely inconsistent (If I pick C, I should spawn at C. I should not spawn next to B so that I have to walk to C. If I wanted to spawn at B, I would pick B) and sometimes doesn't work (you often can't spawn on your teammates for seemingly no reason, even if they're not in combat.

[b]Map design[/b]

Way too big, way too open, way too much walking around. This plus the spawn system means a lot of wasted time each game just trying to get to where you want to be.

[b]Other stuff[/b]

I will admit that for all the bullshit, I did still have some rare moments of fun. There were a few 'Battlefield' moments, where everythings exploding and the entire team rushes the point together. Those are cool. But they'd be cooler in any other Battlefield game.

This is a great Battlefield game to play but that wasn't originally the case. The game didn't have a very good launch, as it was initially plagued with technical bugs and gameplay imbalances. Since then however, it has been improved upon to the point that it now offers a great gameplay experience. As with previous Battlefield titles, this game provides an outstanding immersive experience thanks to its great graphics, sound effects, and gunplay.

As its title suggests, the game's events take place in the year 2042. After several environmental disasters and global societal collapse, only 2 superpowers remain: the United States and Russia. While the game focus is on their worldwide conflicts, it doesn't have any impact on gameplay since both factions have access to the same weapons and equipment. Even though both sides possess some faction specific vehicles, it doesn't matter again since they share similar characteristics to promote balanced gameplay.

You can count on Battlefield games to offer an incredible immersive experience and Battlefield 2042 is no exception. The graphics look amazing. The sound effects are incredibly realistic sounding. The gunplay is responsive and fluid. Some maps even have scripted weather events like tornadoes and sandstorms which impact gameplay. You can get caught in a tornado if you get to close to it.

Break. There are a large number of different weapons classes in the game. Assault rifles. LMGs. SMGs. Sniper Rifles. DMR's. Shotguns. Crossbows. Pistols. melee attacks and executions. RPGs. Anti air weapons. However, there are so many weapons in each class that it leads to overlapping characteristics among some weapons.

There are also many different vehicle classes available for use. tanks. Jeeps. infantry fighting vehicles. jets. helicopters. quad copter. hovercraft. While there aren't too many vehicles in each class, they share similar characteristics as to promote game balance.

However, there are some negatives to the game. it's common for vehicle sounds to sometimes cut out as a result of so many game sounds running concurrently. This can lead to tanks inadvertently sneaking up on unaware players who didn't hear these ordinarily loud vehicles. the game's building destruction is inconsistent, with many buildings having limited or no destructibility due to map design. Battlefield 2042 features various levels of environmental destruction, from micro-destruction of small objects and debris to large-scale destruction that allows players to create new paths by blowing holes in walls.

In closing, I think Battlefield 2042 is a great game to play. It offers gamers a consistent battlefield gameplay and immersive experience that they've come to expect. And that's why I gave this game a score rating of 8 out of 10.",True,0,16902

Battlefield 2042.. What can I say, I pre ordered 4 years ago here on Steam, played closed and open beta, I was really disappointed and it was a mess, a horrible mess, then I got refunded. Now, now this game it is what should have been 4 years ago, really! I am impressed, but it is not exactly what BF3 or BF4 was or Battlefield 1, which was the last BF title that had some of the DNA of this series, at least for me, lets say BF 2042 is different, maybe they tried something new, it is good now, but the game is at the end of his days and many come here for the goodies you will get in BF 6 from the free battle pass and if you come from the BF 6 open beta to this you will hate it since is different, the TTK (time to kill) is faster than what in BF 6 open beta, BF 6 goes a bit more back to what old school Battlefield series was, seems more balanced, try it if you got it for under 3 euros or on discount, definitely better than BF V and Call of Duty tittles right now, if they put all the dedication which was in this one in BF 6 too maybe the hope that EA did not ruin this tittle too is alive.Still found some bugs here and there, not game breaking but still, after 4 years for some of them developers should be ashamed, especially for the one that force you to turn off the EA overlay so you can open the game since it will give an on their way error as they say when you want to open the game, which did not happen for more than 130 hours of the game then after an over 700 mb update the magical error appeared and it's spread among many players.

Review:

I bought Battlefield 2042 because I wanted to experience the future of warfare. The future, apparently, is 127 people running around like headless chickens while I get sniped from across the map by a guy named “xX420NoScopeJesusXx.”

Highlights of my career as a soldier of tomorrow:

Spawned in, immediately died to a hovercraft doing donuts on a skyscraper.

Called in a tank, crushed by my own tank. Respect the circle of life.

Tried to revive a teammate—he gave up mid-revive and bled out while staring directly into my eyes. Haunting.

Climbed a 50-story building for “tactical advantage,” got hit by a tornado, ended up in Narnia.

Discovered the wingsuit. Spent 2 hours pretending I was in Just Cause 4. Killed no one, had the time of my life.

My specialist shouted a quirky one-liner right after I got blasted by a rocket launcher. Very immersive.

The game promised “All-Out Warfare.” They delivered. Just not sure if it’s against the enemy team or my own sanity.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,204352732,"
In its current state, there’s little to complain about regarding the performance of Battlefield 2042. The game runs smoothly and without major issues. However, the design choices behind the maps leave much to be desired. Most of them feel like vast, empty fields with very little cover, making gameplay repetitive and uninspired. Even in team deathmatch, the maps are often either far too large or far too open, which hurts the pacing and intensity.

Spawn points can also be frustrating, sometimes placing players miles away from the action. Another strange design choice is the flow between matches: instead of seamlessly moving to the next round, the game kicks you back to the main menu before starting again. It feels unnecessary and disruptive.

On the positive side, the weapon mechanics are solid, the vehicles feel fine, and performance is great, the game runs buttery smooth. Unfortunately, good performance (now after 4 years) alone isn’t enough to make the game feel like a true Battlefield experience. Destruction, a defining feature of the series, is almost completely absent. Most maps lack personality or atmosphere, with only a few exceptions that manage to stand out.

Another major issue is how heavily casualized the game feels compared to its predecessors. The introduction of operators and their cringe voice-lines at the end of a round, which were later forced into loosely defined class systems, was probably one of the biggest mistakes the developers could have made. This change stripped away much of the tactical depth and identity that Battlefield was known for. Often, the maps and overall atmosphere feel strangely empty, more like a knock-off set in some alternate Rainbow Six Siege universe rather than a proper Battlefield game.

And then there's the soundtrack, which, with all due respect, is probably one of the worst I've ever heard. After just one hour, I turned the in-game music off entirely because it was more of an insult to the ears than an enhancement to the atmosphere. Whoever was responsible for the soundtrack should, frankly, never be allowed anywhere near the development studio again.

Overall, while Battlefield 2042 performs well technically, it falls short in nearly every other area. From uninspired maps and poor design choices to its disastrous soundtrack, the game fails to capture the soul, atmosphere, and identity that once defined the franchise.",False,2,1386

But outside of constant crashing, the game is also just not good. Open weapons feels wrong in a Battlefield game. That isn't to mention how abysmal the maps are. They are the worst part of the game.

Do you like paying full price for a tech demo?

This game promised “the future of Battlefield” and delivered… a futuristic PowerPoint presentation where bullets are optional, and patch notes are the real endgame.

- The uninstall button works flawlessly.
- Pretty clouds.

Cons:

- Everything under them.",False,0,6351
Battlefield 2042,1517290,204275221,"This Battlefield... It’s not a bad game in itself, far from it, but it suffers from major problems that spoil the experience, especially for the purists of the series:

Random and unstable ping: It’s the nightmare. During a game, my ping can suddenly reach 150 ms and get stuck like that. It’s all the more frustrating when on BF1 and BF5, I have absolutely no problem. It seems that EA and their servers have a complicated relationship...

Unbalanced maps: Some maps cruelly lack balance, which can quickly become boring.

Unintuitive interface: Compared to the clarity of BF1 or BF5, the interface here lacks readability and is less ergonomic.

Limited destructibility: It’s a major disappointment. One of the essences of Battlefield is the destruction of buildings. It’s a shame to see this feature so neglected.

(Optional) Absence of a real single-player campaign: Even if it is not the heart of the game for everyone, the lack of a scripted story, as we could have had in BF1 or BF5, leaves a taste of unfinished.

So, why recommend it anyway?
Despite these big flaws, I recommend this game for a simple reason: its price on promotion. For 3 euros, it would be a shame to miss it. We won’t complain too much at that price. It’s a title that allows one to let off steam and unwind when everything works out (which, let’s be honest, is not always the case).

I sincerely hope that EA will be able to set the bar right. They have an exceptional license in their hands, but it is unfortunately tarnished by decisions that seem more guided by pocket filling than by real skill in the video game. Courage to the developers...",True,0,1690

The scale of the battles is still unmatched. 128-player chaos, vehicles flying past, tornadoes ripping through the map — it’s the kind of madness only Battlefield can deliver. Portal is a sleeper hit too. Being able to play classic maps with new weapons and rulesets adds a ton of variety.

Specialists took some getting used to, but I actually enjoy the flexibility now. The game feels more like a sandbox where you can play your way, and it works. Movement feels great, gunplay is tight, and the map reworks have improved flow a lot.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,204218906,"I've played this game for a decent amount of time, and I can say one thing, is that I do actually have fun with this game. However, I still have a lot of problems with it despite that. Like, I can list things that I specifically do and don't like;

Negatives:
- Most of the maps range from decent to horrible, and I can only think of two maps that are decent. Pretty much all of the maps just have really questionable or terrible design in general. I mainly play Breakthrough, and I can say that just about all of them are pretty bad. The Oil Rig one is the absolute worst, it is the most awful design period. Also, almost every map is just big open spaces, very little areas for meaningful close combat. And the one map that IS more close quarters is just a grenade fest that would make Halo weep, so...
- Gunplay is really questionable. Compared to previous BF games that I've played, this one's gunplay is just plain weird. Also insane recoil on a lot of guns, and you're gonna have to get a LOT of kills to actually get good attachments to make it less painful.
- Weird Class System, where there are ""Operators"", and it has that weird same vibe as like a Hero Shooter or something because instead of being a nameless Soldier, you're playing an actual specific character with a certain Gear and Ability tied to them. So you're running around with 64 people, clones killing each other basically, and it just is weird for a Battlefield game in my opinion. And some of these characters have better stuff than others, but it's not really that bad to me, it just is a bizarre direction that didn't really need to happen, in my opinion. Oh yeah, and these characters have English and Russian voicelines, which is just so odd, it just only makes me question this design choice even more!
- Driving in this game is terrible if you aren't driving a Tank or Heavy land vehicle. The Camera sways like crazy while turning and controlling vehicles just feels so awful, particularly the faster ones. But like I said, Tanks don't have this issue very much.
- UI And Menu reeks of CoD Ick. When I first booted up this game, I almost felt like I bought the wrong game, because the Main Menu feels like Call of Duty in how it looks and feels. Basically, I'm not a fan. It's completely different from any other BF game I've played. But it could be worse, I guess, so not my biggest gripe.
- It has Microtransaction. Yeah, full priced game with microtransaction. Not my biggest complaint, but this is also a deviation from the norm of BF. It's pretty ignorable though, since its purely cosmetics.
- The Gimmick of being able to switch the attachments on your gun while on-field is nice, but is a rather forgettable feature. I can guarantee you most people probably don't even know it's a feature or actively use it, especially since most people probably just do that after they die.
- There's a weather system... I... guess? There's tornadoes, but they're more of a major inconvenience that doesn't add anything good to the gameplay other than being slightly intimidating the first few times. I thought the marketing for this game before it came out focused a lot on the unique weather system or something, but there's literally just tornadoes... that rarely even happen on maybe two maps. In fact... I haven't seen a tornado in a while now...
- There's Environmental Destruction, but it's not very impactful and doesn't offer that much strategic or tactical advantage, since most things aren't even destructible to begin with, or minimal at best.

Positives:
+ I like that Vehicles are ludicrously loaded out with 2 to 3 gunners on top of the drivers, so 4 people can just be sitting in a tank and just be a menace. I say that because that's me. I like being a menace. But it's pretty easy to die with a Tank/Heavy Land Vehicle if you're not careful so it's not overly oppressive, in my opinion. (As long as your teammates aren't brain damaged and actually contest the vehicles, that is)
+ I like that the support classes beyond Assault kinda have their own niche and you can get high on the scoreboard without getting that many kills as long as you're being useful. This is more of a personal thing for me.
+ There's a lot of guns. But you do have to unlock most of them.
+ There's plenty of progression, such as with the (Current) Battle Pass, Player Levels, and more so, with unlocking attachments and new weapons, so there's at least stuff to work towards while playing.
+ It's decently optimized, had very little technical issues with the game. With that being said though, this ""positive"" only comes from the fact that the game is about 4 years old at the time of this review, so I'd be shocked if they failed to optimize the game at all in that entire timeline. But my experience may not be the same for others. This is PC, after all.

Most people will probably NOT be coming back to BF 2042 once BF 6 comes out, because 2042 doesn't really offer a good enough or unique enough experience to warrant having it's own dedicated fans, compared to previous installments in the franchise. And also, at least from the Beta, BF 6 plays significantly better, and has significantly better maps, fixing two of my biggest issues with this game. So I really hope they don't somehow fuck up that release, because they have a good thing going with it currently.

Overall though, even if I have fun with the game, I can't exactly give this a thumbs up. My biggest gripes, being the Maps and the Gunplay do affect the core of the gameplay, and they are not great. And having played the Battlefield 6 Beta before picking up this game (It was on a $3 sale), yeah, that just made it harder to give this game a ""good"" review. If I could just give a ""Mixed"" rating, I would. But I don't particularly feel bad for giving this game a thumbs down either. The game was worth it for $3 though, it's good enough until the next game comes out. Definitely would not have shelled out $60 for this though.",False,1,5259

Battlefield 2042,1517290,204132996,"No, very big No. I played for the Battlefield 6 skins, didn't realized how miserable of an experience it would be after playing the battlefield 6 demo. 

The audio/Sound design throws me off, sound is muffled and can't accurately tell where the people are coming from. 

Trying to get into actual servers is a horrible experience, good luck trying to get into the servers you want, you're better off creating ai servers to play, that's assuming you can, there is the possibility that the servers are capped with xp grind servers and you may not even be able to create a server to begin with. 

The battle pass itself was ridiculous and excessive, the amount of xp needed to complete the battle pass is too much, best method is to do missions, which I understand if you want to prolong the pass, and you're probably thinking you can take advantage of the 2x-3x XP weekends, fantastic idea, right? BUT you are capped on experience... the game will outright cap you if you're doing well even in double xp, why?!

Guns didn't feel responsive at times, not sure if due to server issues or if the game is just clunky. Same with bullet registration, there are times where the bullet registration isn't working right and either you can't hit anything or you're hitting when you really shouldn't be, once again can't tell if it's game clunk or server issues. 

Either way I would not recommend, I got it for the battle pass for the skins and in the end just spend extra money to get out of that pass. Thank god they're not using this formula again.",False,0,6997
Battlefield 2042,1517290,204132469,"I will say I did have [b]SOME[/b] fun playing this with friends, but the overall experience is [b]STILL[/b] garbage and this is with Years of updates trying to patch the game to be playable which is at most mildly enjoyable to insufferable between the grind and horrid 
I decided to challenge myself a little bit by getting all the achievements (Which is a grind that you can cheese about 70% of them for), before this game goes completely dead when BF6 comes out 

But to give a brief overview of my 138.7 Hours playing this mess I have
1. Unlocked all Weapons (Including getting the [spoiler]2142 Prototype[/spoiler] Easter egg weapon they just added)
2. Got all achievements (Which includes getting Tier 1 Mastery with a Vehicle, Weapon, Specialist, and Gadget, and playing Hazard zone) This was the worst of the grind.
3. Completed a progressively more grindy 60 Tier Battlepass that I only chose to Grind for The battlefield 6 cosmetics, which the only saving grace was the fact they are doing 2XP on every weekend until 6 comes out. 

And I should note that with 4 weeks of the freebie weekly challenges that give you about 5.5 tiers a week. Each 1/10th of a tier was taking 40k, or 400k xp for an entire tier towards the end of the pass if you were actually grinding the pass like I was. Mind you I am doing this in my free time when I get off of work from my ACTUAL Full time job, to come home and do this as a full time job in itself.
I can say I had fun with the Iwo Jima 24/7 playlist, but that went away pretty quick once they realized people were having fun.
I do not care if it often goes on sale often for like 3 dollars you will be wasting your money and time if your actually trying to play the game, plus its almost guaranteed this game will be dead as hell after 10/10/2025.

TLDR its bad, don't waste your time, for anything other than the BF6 cosmetics if you really want them that bad.

All of them have no thought put into them at all and encourage the most shameless camping and one-sided games, to the point where the outcome of the games depend on which team camps a central high position the most, even in TDM. If you play TDM and get placed into the team that has the worse spawns, the other team absolutely will camp the best positions the entire game and win, every single time, and there is absolutely nothing at all you can do about it. You will see that on certain maps, the winning team will always be the same because of this. The only fun to be had in this game is playing on the maps that were originals in other games, like the BF3 maps and others.

There is no teamwork, nor is there any incentive to play this game as a team. Nobody revives, and there is no incentive to revive. You will get ran past by 10 medics and not one of them will stop to revive you. Nobody that plays this game can hold a position, so even if you have 10 teammates around you, there will be an enemy that runs in and kills everyone because your teammates weren't paying any attention. Every game mode is just TDM/FFA, and the vehicles just have free reign to go anywhere in the map with impunity. You will have people spawn basically on top of you and kill you instantly, meaning, there is no protection at all once you've taken a command post. You could be 2 objectives back from the ""frontlines"" and still get lasered 5-10 seconds after spawning. There is no safety anywhere. In TDM it doesn't matter where you spawn. There's a 70% chance you die within 5 seconds of spawning just because there was already someone there.

Time to kill is absolutely insane for vehicles. It takes upwards of 5 AT shots to kill a tank, or any armored vehicle. The helicopters are broken since TTK is so high. They simply fly away, repair, and come right back. You will get run over by armored vehicles and there's nothing you can do about it since it takes 5+ AT shots to kill them. You will die before you can reload enough times to kill literally any vehicle in this game.

The server lag on any game mode outside of TDM makes the game completely unplayable. In TDM, the framerate is fine, no rubber banding, game runs smooth. Play 64v64 conquest games, however, and you start getting a consistent server side lag. You can mostly ignore it in 64v64, but it's still super annoying. The worst is 128v128 conquest... It is unplayable. The server lag is so bad that people pop in and out of existence all of the time, the rubber banding makes movement annoying, and you will consistently die long after you've gone into cover and healed. This is consistent for every 128v128 match.

Everyone was right... this is definitely the worst BF game ever made, and it's not even close.

[b]Things I dislike;[/b]
[list]
[*]Specialists suck. Their commentary is obnoxious, and unable to be muted. Not much more to say about that.
[*]Open classes encourage play that is not aligned with cohesive team play, nor the true Battlefield experience.
[*]Battlepasses blow. It is needlessly difficult to unlock the things obtainable via the BP.  Of course, my complaint is moot. BP's won't go away because corporations are growing increasingly greedy, particularly in this era of the current administration and his fellow politicians bending over backwards to appease the companies who bribe them above and below the table.
[*]The meat grinder maps, Stadium and Redacted, kinda suck compared to Locker and Metro.
[*]Calling in equipment is cool, but being able to call in game changing equipment like tanks is over-powered and potentially gamebreaking. This should only be possible at controlled, uncontested points and main spawns (at least in regards to conquest).
[*]Time between vehicle spawns is way too long. I've always been a tanker main, so I'm not really a fan of waiting 2 or more minutes to get back into a tank!
[*]There should be vehicles on the map and in the spawn. Not a fan of the lack of vehicles that spawn in as a reward for objective control.
[/list]

[b]Things I like;[/b]
[list]
[*]The maps are otherwise pretty good. Not many that I believe will be iconic and remembered highly as the franchise moves forward like you might with maps from BF2-BF1, but overall an enjoyable assortment. I really enjoy the size of some of the maps.
[*]Being able to play against bots is awesome. I don't like that it counts towards you KD and other stats, but being able to run your own server to run bots is a great way to get back into shooters after a long gap (my last multiplayer FPS was BF4, and the few dozen hours of BF1 it took me to realize that WW1 is not the setting for me). I also really enjoyed that I was able to practice helo's and such without ruining other peoples days! I played quite a few hours in my private servers with my friend, and we had an absolute blast with that.
[*]There is a huge collection of guns. I really like the amount of attachments, as well, though I do feel that the unlock order is a little silly. IMO, bipods should be one of the first unlocks, particularly on LMGs.
[/list]

[i]Overall, I am not impressed, but also not disappointed. This is easily my least favorite Battlefield out of BF2, BF2142, BC2, BF3, BF4, and BF1.[/i] 
I must admit, I honestly never would have played this game had it not been for BF Studios putting the free cosmetic items for BF6 in the battlepass. The launch was very off putting after initially being very excited that BF was returning to a modern/nearly modern setting. Finding out the game was a crappy hero shooter missing fundamental features of not only a Battlefield game, but a FPS game in general, was very disappointing. It is evident that it was built as a battle royale first, rather than adding a battle royale mode to a game built for Battlefield fans. All of that effort and they never even put a BR mode into the game! Not that I want it, nor the extraction shooter mode, anyways. [u][I commend Dice/BF Studios/EA for sticking with this game, and evolving it into something relatively enjoyable towards the end of its life. It is obvious that they really put in a lot of work to get this game to the point is at today. It is also obvious that they tried to replicate the Battlefield feel, though IMO the core elements of this game prevent that from being completely possible.[/u]

I really wanted to like this. EA had years to iron things out, but somehow Battlefield 2042 still manages to fall flat—hard.

👍 Pros:

The wingsuit is a fun new addition and brings some fresh tactical options to gameplay.

Portal could have been the standout feature. I managed to create a few cool modes like Fast Rockets Only, Snipers, and Knives.

👎 Cons:

The core Battlefield gameplay feels stripped down—basic at best, and missing the things we loved from past titles. Destruction is limited, and team play is almost nonexistent.

Portal mode editing is frustrating. The tool is overly complex, with vague labels and hard-locked variables that limit creativity. I couldn’t even boost run speed or spawn quads in a version of Quad-Rockets game I thought would be fantastic.

Server hosting is buggy and unreliable. I often couldn’t shut down my own server to make changes, leading to unnecessary downtime for me and my friends.

To top it off, EA locked Battlefield 6 cosmetics behind this game. Who wants to grind cosmetics in a release that so many already walked away from?

🎮 Final Thoughts:
There are glimpses of good ideas here, but they’re buried under poor design choices and technical problems. This should’ve been a course correction for the franchise, not a step backward.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203941790,"Wow...

Worst matchmaking system in video games' history.
At totally new player (level 22) I have to compete against S472 (whatever that means), with max badges, fully upgraded weapons and extrem movement a mapcontrol... Loosing in 90% of the matches and beeing spawncamped is everything, but not fun.

Slowest ""Battle Pass"" grindig in video games' history.
I played several shooter games before (CS, R6:S, COD, etc.), but this is crazy.
I barely can get 1 (one) level in a 60-level ""Free Pass"" in an afternoon.
The sublevel system (that 10 dots / level) is totally inconsistent. Sometimes I get 1 'dot', sometimes I get 3.
Sometimes I got more 'dots' when I play bad (critically bad stats) and my team is loosing, than after a game where I play (relatively) good, with more kills, assists, objective scores, etc... Why?

Worst damage pattern I ever experienced.
For sure, the 80% of the enemies simply 1shot me, but I can kill them for example with RPG by only direct hit. If the RPG exploding next to them in a corridor, or in front of their feet (I mean 20 pixels, not meters), they just run toward and 1shot me with almost any weapon. What the hell is going on? I hit them with a f***ing anti-tank rocket, LOL!

I played BF Vietnam, BF 3, BF 4, but the series lost me between 1 and V (because of bugs and mediocre gameplay). I want to come back to play BF 6, that's why I bought 2042, to tease myself a bit. And, in addition, my friend said ""the game is OK now, the devs repaired the game in the last 2 years"".
So, this game was WORSE than it's actual state?
Jesus Christ... I cannot, or simply don't dare to imagine that.

I bought the game at a promo for 3€.
Worst spent money in 2025. I know, it is impossible to refund a game after 13 hours of playtime, but I would refund this.

I CAN NOT recommend this game even for 3€ or $3!

There are some nice ideas, but it's not really quite Battlefield. It feels too floaty and loose in many ways. Its progression systems are too arcade like and lightly implemented. 

I really hate most of the skins and the fact that i'm seeing the same skins on both sides of the conflict - it absolutely misses the mark in placing you inside the conflict, but it actually had some solid ideas for trying to give you a ""why"" for each battle. 

I also cannot stand how they fill up servers with AI that gradually get replaced with players, and the fact that match-made servers do not persist match to match.

I suppose the most damning thing i can say about it is this; I played 60 hours of BF6 in the beta weekend and that went by in a flash. Yet, the 40 hours of BF2042 in the last few weeks felt like hundreds of hours of tiresome grinding.

Anyway, it was only 3 bucks. So based on that perspective, there's sufficient value to be gained here.

FOR COMPARISON, I played the BF6 beta perfectly fine, not an issue at all, sure I had to play at low-medium settings but was consistently above 60fps and could use any background app without issue.

2042 However, takes my entire computer hostage. If I have more than 1 background app open? Lag. If I have 2 firefox tabs open? Oh you better believe those are literally impossible to click on or use in any meaningful way.

Hell even if I close everything but Spotify and Discord BF2042 takes up so much of my computer the music in spotify lags and stutters.

All Weapons being available to everyone means 90%+ of your deaths will be to Assault Rifles and Sniper Rifles, some maps are beyond ridiculous in size in that they are mostly empty space (though there are better ones for sure), and the panicked attempt at squeezing the ""Specialists"" into the old Battlefield mold of a class system (after EA realized they fit the overall formula horribly), coupled with a significant downplay in their ""attitude"" and characterization, has instead left them as utterly soulless, strange wax figures that will grunt out a comment before a game and then mostly try to stay in the ""random soldier"" lane.

Who are you Boris, why are you telling others to shut up and pay attention? I really don't care.

Annoyances like being booted back to the main screen for matchmaking after every game and the likes continuously takes you out of the action and robs you of the chance to form relations to your fellow players. People obsessed with K/D ratios will stand on your body and absolutely fu-hucking not revive you, resupply you, heal you, or otherwise engage in team or even squad oriented play - I recognize that medics refusing to revive (and tanks driving away when you try to repair them) is something of a ""classic"" in BF, but I want to emphasize that I have never before played a Battlefield game so utterly atomized in terms of its team play components being spread thin in favor of individual expression.

Turns out this amount of ""player choice"" makes for a bunch of headless chickens running in circles even if you try to make 128 of them butt heads.

2042 cost me 3 euros with the massive discount that was. Would I have bought this without the Battlefield 6 unlocks in its free battle pass? Absolutely not, nor could I stomach going further than level 30, which given my hours I guess is me technically ""getting my money's worth"".

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203744316,"Not the Battlefield We Remember

What we're experiencing here is not Battlefield—not in any meaningful sense. While it wears the name and leans heavily on the franchise’s legacy, this title feels less like a continuation of what came before and more like a vehicle designed to serve a very different purpose: monetization.

From the very beginning, this project seemed less focused on delivering a cohesive, immersive FPS experience and more concerned with becoming a platform for live-service content. Battle passes, weapon charms, cosmetics, and character skins dominate the experience, often feeling like the game’s true focus. It's hard to shake the sense that gameplay and identity were sacrificed to make room for recurring revenue streams.

The shift from a class-based system to one centered around marketable characters exemplifies this. Where Battlefield once prided itself on clarity and team role distinction, we now have a cast of interchangeable operators—difficult to read, visually noisy, and clearly built with skin sales in mind. The result is a game where readability and tactical depth have taken a backseat to cosmetic flair.

Map design, too, has suffered. Many of the environments feel large for the sake of scale, but ultimately empty—bereft of the purposeful design and flow that defined previous titles. Objectives are often bottlenecked through narrow chokepoints, leading to chaotic grenade spam and little strategic depth. There's no real sense of front-line progression or evolving engagements—just static, disconnected skirmishes in uninspired spaces. Worse yet, these maps are visually cluttered, with excessive decoration that often hinders clarity rather than enhancing immersion.

What’s perhaps most disheartening is how little of the original Battlefield DNA remains. The atmosphere, the identity, the focus on large-scale, class-based warfare—these elements have been diluted or removed entirely in favor of something more generic, more marketable, and ultimately, less memorable.

It's not just that the game is different—games evolve. But this isn’t evolution; it’s replacement. What made Battlefield unique has been stripped away and replaced with systems and designs better suited for a live-service mobile game than a flagship multiplayer shooter.

There was a time when Battlefield stood apart—when it offered something distinctive, something with weight and identity. This direction feels like it’s forgotten that entirely.",False,0,5666

I've been playing it a lot lately to get the BF6 pass items, and it's given me a lot of hands-on time now that the dust has settled and the game is in its final state. They improved a lot of the issues with the original release, but those should never have been issues to begin with and were the result of poor developmental choices and poor corporate direction. Put simply, they lost the plot and released a half-baked sourdough that nobody liked.
   What we have now is a shell of Battlefield. The operators bring some interesting nuance to the table, but that interest is unnecessary. Battlefield was never a Hero Shooter, and trying to make it into one was a mistake that symbolizes EA's biggest departure from the classic formula in this title. We didn't want or need a 64v64 Overvalorsmite, we just wanted a badass Battlefield as advertised in the teaser trailer (it's still a badass teaser trailer).
   To add insult to injury, we have mini-narratives when loading into matches and I think Hazard Zone (that I never played) was supposed to add some tension to the setting, fighting on behalf of nations for advantages in the global theater. This, too, was half-baked. The dossier trailers, the visual storytelling in some levels, and some of the art that was released all push toward what could have been a compelling campaign to tell the story of this post-apocalyptic near-future that rocked the world so hard that it shattered countries apart and created ""No-Pats."" They let this slip through their fingers, and they gave us a generic multiplayer hero-shooter.
   ANOTHER SIN is that they added CoD movement. I play Battlefield for the slower pace, deliberate movement, and loose tactical thought. I don't play Squad or Arma because I don't want a milsim, but I don't play CoD either because I don't want to ""git gud"" against movement tech kids who will 360 bunny hop combat slide Emperor Palpatine lightsaber spin their way into a headshot against me. I shouldn't ever get slide-tackled to insta-death in a Battlefield game or be trying to track the easter bunny as it pelts me with crossbow bolts, but that is exactly what happens in 2042. Another tonedeaf departure from BFDNA by corporate overlords who just wanted to make something that checks vague ""what makes games popular?"" boxes.
   The maps are big and empty except for little skirmish zones that have well-constructed set pieces. The issue is when you don't have a vehicle to traverse the meadows between POIs and spend so much time running that your character should probably need to chug an entire gallon of water. The maps would either need more interesting points between these combat arenas or a pare-down of dead space. It's poor level design, except where it isn't and it's frustrating to try and describe.
   The vehicles are either under- or overpowered with no in-between. If you can stay away from Stingers and other munitions, then you can absolutely rock the world of the enemy team with impunity. On the same note, if you try to take down a vehicle by yourself then even a full load of C5 won't kill anything bigger than a jeep on the ground. There's no room for sneaky ""take down the tank that's abusing everyone"" gameplay. On the flip side, if you and your team and everyone all dogpile one tank, it's dead in seconds. You would think that this encourages teamplay, but most of the time it just encourages people to abandon the objective because their grappling hook can't hurt a tank.

This game isn't worth the price I paid for it back when it launched. If you catch it on sale for like $5 then sure, because it does play decently as a shooter and it might scratch the itch for something with vehicle warfare between now and BF6. I would rather play BFV or even BF4, old as it is, but they suckered me in with the Farewell Pass.
   I played the BF6 beta. It's everything that BF2042 should have been. It does everything right that 2042 did wrong. It has its own flaws, like vehicle routes in maps feeling very on-rails, but it feels like a modernized BF3 and I'm here for it. That's the only reason I'm giving 2042 my time: for the sake of the better game.

This game sucks and you should play one of the older titles. Battlefield 2042 is a sewn-together abomination of what Stakeholders thought a popular shooter game would be and they sold themselves out to their own ideas to make a game with zero identity beyond its name and some very basic checkboxes.
   If you decide to play it at all, get it on sale for dirt cheap because it's not worth more than that. It's unbalanced, the maps feel empty, and Hazard Zone isn't even worth talking about. The potential narrative is lost because they didn't add a campaign (or even the watered-down ""Stories"") and all you're left with is a game of lost potential.

the years has passed and this game is still bad, i just go it because it was on super sale and well i'm completing every battlefield at 100%.
but why it's so [b]BAD?[/b]
First of all: bf2042 is still suuuuuuuuper buggy not day one levels but it has some serious bugs/glitches like infinity loading screens, random crashes, cam getting stucked in one place when switching to a different cams like lis guided rocket launcher or simply the first person mode inside a tank (this would always happen in solo vs bots) wins not counting properly, hit registration being incosistent, getting shot behinds walls...
Second: the maps are horrible big without covers and very forgettable like a bad dream (worst one discarded)
Third: hazard mode is useless is just the base game maps with drivers that drops on the map that are protected by the AI and that's it nothing more, you spawn pick drivers and extract NOTHING MORE the only ""fun"" thing is when you are trying to extract and find real people can be intense (rarely but still) the only decent part is not even always ""fun"" since the meta is boring dozer, incendiary nades, smokes... 
Fourth: not a bf game? even if i played mostly for achievements i got almost 0 battlefield vibes and cinematic moments, i tried playing conquest rush breakthrough and team deathmatch normally but i got pretty bored a very forgettable experience unlike bf5 or bf6
Fifth: portal mode a wonderfull idea on the paper but it's barely working and right now it's full of this damn xp servers. maybe when the game was at his peak (if it ever had one) it was working and offered great experiences.
Sixth: sound design and immersion... feels like i'm shooting with a toy gun and vehicles have 0 weight and getting shot feels nothing, and the voicelines are so bad and annoying this is the first time i muted the voice lines in a bf game. 
passing from bf5 to this was a big shock.
Seventh: the specialist why and why is just a spam of random bullshit and they are so forgettable useless addition. 

i'm pretty sure someone will still try to bash me defending this mess... gotta say i'm playing battlefield since 1943 and at the time i was watching very often 1942 YT videos so i know my own, even if i picked late bf5 and bf2042 because i had big doubts during the beta and i wasn't partically interested on those entries.",False,39,3121

The 234 hours I have on this game was 90% AFK lobbies , 5% helicopter lobbies, 5% actually playing the game for weekly challenges.

The only legitimate fun I had was playing the BF3/4/BC2 modes which they introduced late into week 2 and by that point many people just went to the  AFK lobbies so you were playing with 80% bot lobbies.

Spawning on point you're defending has a tendency to put you well outside the point. Hit reg is still a problem from time to time. The thing I was really disappointed in as a new player to the franchise was the lack of cohesion. I had always heard about the team focused gameplay of battlefield and I agree with others assessment that I chose the wrong game to enter the franchise if I wanted the role based squad play of other entries like BF3. 

I must say, the close quarters conquest playlist is super fun. A limited map pool but just the right size for 64 players to maximize conflict. The maps are what call of duty wishes it was. I would not be surprised that if they keep that playlist moving into BF6, that's where the majority of CoD converts find themselves gravitating to.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203498348,"I’ve been playing Battlefield since BF1942, but I skipped BF2042 at launch and only picked it up recently during a sale. With the “Road to BF6” event, I decided it was finally time to give it a shot.

At first, it was frustrating: low-res text in the menus, clunky performance, long loading times both into the game and into matches, plus the awkward character voice lines in the menus. My first games felt overwhelming, and I quit quickly, I just wasn’t enjoying it.

A week later, still curious, I gave it another chance and that’s when I discovered Portal. That’s where the game finally clicked. Jumping into El Alamein, hardcore vanilla servers, or crazy custom modes with wild modifiers reminded me why I fell in love with Battlefield in the first place.

Visually, the game looks fantastic in 4K with Ray Tracing, the gunplay feels satisfying, and the massive maps offer freedom to flank, explore, or just enjoy the chaos. It’s not perfect, but with new map Iwo Jima the game finally feels alive again.

1, for the price, its pretty great! id personally spend at max 15-20 pounds PROVIDED the main servers are still lively, portal thrown in is a fun bonus.

2, Its in my eyes for what it is and the standards you would expect after 1 and 5 its very lackluster vs other battlefields, i haven't PLAYED 4 much, but in terms of the feel of battlefield, it doesn't hit home, and despite portal being more akin they too feel limited and somewhat of a downgrade? in bf1 and bf5 for example, there atmosphere, graphic design and animations of how players move, combined with the vfx feels alot better then this by alot, it does have some upsides, the graphics ISN'T bad persay, but doesn't feel as good as the older games, it feels like in terms of ""quality"" it rivals 3, but art direction, its the worst in my eyes.

3, as a GAME, now after playing it for a while, including a fair amount of portal, in comparison to what i seen and played a small bit at launch on xbox, its feels like a solid game, it still plays like battlefield and has its own uniqueness (reffering back to point 2 again), the addition of portal allows it to be alot more enjoyable especially being able to play those older maps, and i sometimes enjoy the 128 player mode it offered, however map sizes can be slightly jarring especially if u get left stranded with no car but it has a fair amount of 2042 maps that are enjoyable despite that.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the early C.O.D. games as well, but  early Battlefield  were  for me the better games.   

Apart from playing a few hours  of BF 2042 shortly after the game was released, I  have only recently really got into the game; partly due to the  upcoming Battlefield 6 being released early October. My reasoning for playing now,  was that the servers will  probably not be  as popular once  number 6 takes off, so it won't be as enjoyable, unless you prefer the two Bot infested Coop modes.  

Anyway, after playing for several hours  a few weeks ago, then over the past two weeks playing over a hundred, I've  found the game  had 'partially' returned to it's roots and I'm absolutely loving it.

It takes more than 30 hours of grinding to unlock them and you will have to put up with what is essentially the single worst FPS game to have come out in the last 2 decades. BF2042 is not only an insult to the franchise but to the FPS genre in it's entirety. It's vibe coded by DEI hires and there isn't a single thing that works properly even after 4 years of active development.
The netcode is shit, the weapons are completely unbalanced and all have little to no recoil but at the same time you're required to use the current meta ones if you want to perform well consistently as there are some that are literally laser beams and can 2-3 tap at 100m or more. Vehicles do not feel good to use compared to older BF games, maps are ATROCIOUS, 128 player mode is unplayable for both balance and server stability reasons, the weapon selection is decent (after 4 years) but 99% of people just play with real grounded weapons that have been added in the updates and not the futuristic slop. Characters look and sound awful, classes force you to use specific ""operators"" such as female ones that don't fit the Battlefield universe at all and also reduce your gadget choices because they have hero shooter abilities. Performance wise it manages to rarely stutter even on a 5080 and 9800X3D while running off a 980 Pro and the game likes to just randomly crash.

Out of morbid curiosity, I finally took a peek behind the curtains of a game that has fascinated me since before it's release. The story of 2042's production reeks of desperation from publisher EA. After many DICE veterans left for greater pastures, a team of rookies was told to basically ""copy Call of Duty Warzone"". Even worse, my dearly beloved Criterion Games — also a shadow of it's former self — would spent the rest of eternity in the Battlefield-mines. From this purgatory, they worked around the clock to minimize the impact of bad choices made years ago, while investors were told the game was ""way beyond schedule"". In these wretched lands, a big budget will only get you so far.

On many levels, it's an annoying game, yet interesting in how little of the original design survived. At least the setting is engaging enough: a world ravaged by climate change, but still a theatre of war. Amidst the hopelessness and dread, even with our homes destroyed, people's thirst for blood proves the stronger force. It doesn't help that the main characters act goofy and spout quirky one-liners, feeling completely out of place in all the madness. Ultimately, the operator/hero-roles they fulfill are largely pointless, relegated to one of four staple Battlefield classes, with very few differences besides gadgets and awful voice lines. However, there are hundreds of cosmetics to unlock and/or buy, revealing the true inspiration behind their existence.

From a certain distance, the levels are visually appealing. Up close, players will spend time running through empty spaces with poor visibility, promoting the playstyle of not-moving. Destruction is noticeably absent, hurting the visual spectacle the series is known for. The only novelty is the scale of the levels, but this does not pair well with poor navigation and the chaos brought by 128 players.

Ironically, the Plus-system — the game's stand-out feature — is the least buggy in practice, even though the developers have disregarded it. At any moment, the player can change their weapon's accessoires to suit any situation, defeating the point of Battlefield. It comes across as on over-engineered system with a slick visual presentation, a stark contrast to the barebones and static feel to the rest of the UI. It’s as if the idea for this system came first, before the Battlefield-mines opened. Clearly, it was designed for the Warzone-esque experience that 2042 was initially meant to be.

Aside from the obvious mistakes, numerous small inconsistencies paint the picture of a game that should have never seen the light of day. In this sense, Battlefield 2042 resembles a genuine B-movie. Created against better judgement from people working in the mines, while leadership, blind to their own flaws, continually pushed forward. The result is a product that may be interesting to a select few, but a complete waste of time for many.",False,0,2490

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203421155,"Honestly, it's a really fun game; DICE managed to turn it around. It's among the better FPS games I've played in the past 9 years, and that says something, because I think most were terrible. FPS games have really been stagnating, and this one was a diamond in the rough. I have a few criticisms below, but please understand, I really like this game.

The gunplay feels great, so I wish there were modes with more infantry focus. Most of the maps are optimized for really large-scale 64x64 games; there are smaller-scale versions of these maps, and they're ok, but there's a distinctive lack of cover in some. I don't personally like the over-appeal to casuals and campers, and I love that you can counter-snipe as an aggressive player in this game, but we need more small and competitive game modes. I don't understand why there are so few persistent game modes: Conquest, Breakthrough, and TDM... What happened to all the other BF game modes? Why's Rush on a rotator? Why was the destruction toned down? Where's SQDM? Where's the campaign? Where are the ADS leaning mechanics? It seems like BF6's re-implemented these, but I wish they were in this game as well. Also, I really think that there should be some map voting system. Some of the maps are truly awful to me. I get that this game's player population was low, but these things do really help for longevity/replayability; portal should not be the only customization here.

It's not clear to me when the support for this game truly ends (SKG moment). It seems like despite the recent content drops, this game was slated to be on minor patches only. It'd be nice if some of these BF6 things were backported, but I highly doubt it'll happen. I think both this game and BF6 would benefit a lot from something like free weekends/demos; that way people that previously tried the game and refunded it could actually see the improvements (without having to repurchase; the post BF6 beta sale's a good example of this). The BF6 beta was far too short.

I'd guess that this game was created on the back of some incompatible engine version, and a lot of the BF-isms from the past took too long to be ported by the set release date. Some still haven't been, so there's a feeling of it being unfinished. Despite this, I do recommend this game. It has great-feeling gunplay, TTKs, movement, and balance, and it performs well too (hopefully BF6's minimum performance will match, as that's not how it was in the beta).",True,1,13506

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203419853,"Bought this game on sale, and with all the hate this game been going through, I... understand (also might be justified)

Pathetically enough my first battlefield game was Battlefield 6 on Beta, I loved FPS games, and I watched people played Battlefield 3 and 4 on youtube when I was at school and it was amazing (never had the chance to play it because I don't have any PC back then). Then the beta ends, and I picked up Battlefield 1, and it was amazing! The only thing going through my head was ""What have I been missing?""

So one of my friend loved this game (Battlefield 2042), but I had my doubts because of the reviews, in the end of the day it goes on for sale, then more and more of my friends started playing it, and invited me to play, so my thought was... ""Why the hell not? BF6 and BF1 was that awesome, might as well give this one a try)

And I gotta say... It's bad, not necessarily awful, but bad as in (How did the same people that made the masterpiece (BF1 & 6), managed to fumble that hard to create this PoS? What happened at the time?)

The thing that bothered me so much isn't necessarily The COD Movements that people are talking abt, or the Cartoonish Specialist, or Brain Rot skins, etc. (I just took it as a different flavor, like pineapple on pizza thingy)

IT'S SIMPLY HOW INCOMPLETE THE GAME FELT WAS!

- The Net-code
It was awful, with how fast the character and stuff are able to move in this game were they not taking into account how much of a strain it would give to their server bandwidth? I'm not much of a tech guy.. but almost half the sources I read abt the problem I was having in this game always mentioned this. People are teleporting around in the 128 player mode (could be caused from client side CPU bottleneck, but still..), Gun suddenly stopped firing in the middle of a full-auto fights, and world assets be acting weird throughout the game (not in a funny way..)

- The map design
The size and design really does resembles the short, hectic, chaotic play that really is COD, or other fast shooter game type. I know I mentioned that those part are just different flavor but please, do they not take into account stuff that they implemented here? Like battlefield have tanks, airships and helicopters, not to mention this one also have quite the chaotically flaring specialist abilities. The big maps are way too open in a way, it's rather predictable the cover that everyone would take... It's battlefield, we got tanks, airplane bombers and stuff, maybe make more cover that are able to be flattened just like the special butter battlefield game always have, give us the false sense of security that could be taken away at anytime.

- World Physics
The fact that the world component/assets destruction were comical, houses, desks, doors, could still be standing firm after taking 10 tank shots... is just off-putting. no wonder BF vets were so happy for the game physics in bf6 even though I was there thinking ""wasn't this always how battlefield was?"" heck even bf1 could still pull this off with so much less systems demand!

I know I might be missing a lot here, but in short to include for those TL;DR people is..

""The game fails short in all the fundamentals there is, the map design doesn't support the gameplay, the server and coding doesn't support the modes and amount of players, the physics is comically bad that it fails to please older title players""

Realistically speaking I might not have much of a say for the 128 players mode since I managed to confirm that my client side was the one messing it up, and felt like DICE/EA might be able to pull this off with better net-code execution on Battlefield 6. Also would love to see 5 Player squads back on later titles as well (or maybe even 6? <3)",False,0,7096

It’s lackluster, emotionally dead, and just doesn’t click. I can’t even put my finger on exactly why, but after a short time I simply don’t want to play anymore. Maybe it’s:

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203385473,"Battlefield™ 2042 is okay.  There are lot flaws starting with introduction of specialists. It is the least teamwork oriented, encouraged battlefield ever and it shows. Nearly everyone will be an engineer and it makes sense too. There is little incentive to play as assault or support. 

BF2042 is not as good as any of the previous battlefields and easily the worst in it's series. On its own it is just okay and there is fun to be had, the shooting is still good. Some of the graphics effects are very nice like the shock-wave after effect from an explosion. There is no Levolution or major map changing effects. It just does not improve on anything in a big way. The weather effects just don't do it.

Iwo Jima is the best map that has been introduced at a time when the next new battlefield game is arriving tells everything. The rest of the maps are okay to just not good aside from the other classic maps. 

In this scenario where there are specific maps a player wants to play, having a server browser or the choice to select which map to play was vital. However there is no option and only matchmaking into random maps, so the likely hood of playing in a specific map becomes very difficult to achieve and will just wait endlessly without luck. Using the Portal server browser to play or create will also be out of luck as it looks like it is out of capacity from all the afk grind maps currently being hosted. 

Iwo Jima was presented as highlight a map and so it was easily playable during it's introduction but now it is lost in matchmaking hell. For that reason this game is not recommended and will go back to being dead after everyone collects the bf6 skin rewards.",False,0,3732

Battlefield 2042 stands as a monument to DICE and EA's colossal failure, a betrayal so profound it has shattered a fan's heart.

The launch was an absolute catastrophe: endless bugs, embarrassing performance, non-existent netcode, and constant crashes. This was not an AAA title; it was a broken, unfinished beta sold at full price, a brazen slap in the face to anyone who paid for it.

But the true betrayal, the one that ignited the deepest bitterness within me, was at the game's very core: Specialists. They brutally butchered the iconic class system, transforming Battlefield into a generic, soulless 'hero shooter.' Squad cohesion died, replaced by ridiculous aesthetics that utterly disrespected the franchise's legacy and its gritty warfare tone.

The maps were vast and empty, vehicle-dominated, lacking any meaningful destructibility, and came riddled with unforgivable absences like a server browser or basic voice chat. It was an insult to player intelligence, compounded by spongy, frustrating gunplay that made every weapon feel unsatisfying.

And the most bitter pill to swallow? I wasted almost 200 hours on this abysmal mess. Not for enjoyment, not because the game was good, but due to cynical, calculated manipulation: the promise of next-game rewards in this season's Battle Pass for Battlefield 6. They held me hostage, forcing me to endure countless hours of soul-crushing frustration, clinging to the faint hope of a better future. It was nothing short of emotional blackmail.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203377015,"When it works right (IF it works right), it's very meh compared to what BF6 was for the brief time I played it.

I had no issues running BF6 with GeForce RTX 5060, AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 w/ Radeon 860M (2.00 GHz), 32.0 GB ram... but this game runs so poorly that I noticeably frame drop whenever I get close to someone, even at lowest settings.  The cause seems to be awful optimization, to the point where I have to tailor my gameplay to either bullet hose or stay well away to get responsive mouse movement.  Otherwise aiming feels like I'm moving my viewpoint around like the power steering went out on it.   

The classes are OK, but in practice it's really engineers VS vehicles for the most part, and then snipers 800 miles out.  You can see this when you go into conquest 64 or 128, it'll be like 4 assault, 28 engineer, 8 support, 10 recon.  It's necessary because of the constant stream of vehicles (and helicopters) you'll be dealing with.  I don't know whether that's a balance issue or a spawn rate issue, but you'll spend the majority of your time either shooting people down in vehicles, or trying to blow up said vehicles (if you're running to the points).  

About the engineers, some of them are more useful than others.  

Using Viktor...it makes you wonder what they were thinking with the sentry.  I'm sure they envisioned something like the tf2 engi's sentry gun to be used, then thought it was too powerful, and got rid of anything that might make it useful as a sentry gun.  It is a comically bad piece of equipment in its current state, with enemies using their pistols to destroy it in a few seconds.  It will take two seconds from spotting an enemy to actually firing upon them (making an extremely loud ENEMY DETECTED beeep-boop), at which point it seems to do ~6 damage per shot.  I have resorted to using it as a detection device and being surprised if it manages to do anything else.   The achievements related to the sentry gun are now only feasibly accomplished by using bots to farm it out, which just seems sad to me.  

I get the feeling Viktor isn't the only character who's specialty item is or ever was entirely useless, making some of these characters completely ignored by people who wish to win rather than deal with useless novelties.  Frankly, I mostly see the girl with the rocket launcher specialty being used.

The characters for said classes are like bizarre caricatures of what humans are.  Especially when you open the game and they say their weird wooden line, like the medic guy going ""Now is the time"".  It's so weird and awkward.  I guess EA wanted to get in on the hero shooter thing that was big when this game came out, but it is so out of place and wooden in this one.

I guess it was an OK purchase for $3, but for the frustration and poor optimization and just general lack of feeling like it's a battlefield title I can't really recommend it.  God help you if you got this pile for $60.  Like a sucker, I went back to this for the bf6 cosmetics.  I can't say I think it's worth the grind.  Curb your enthusiasm and just get BF6 when it comes out.

Vehicles are definitely pretty strong. Tanks can dominate, a good heli pilot can make your life hell, but in most cases, there's a class designed to deal with it.

Also bin ich auf den Controller gewechselt, doch das war noch schlimmer: Ich spiele mit einem PS5-Controller, aber das Spiel hat ihn ständig als Xbox-Controller angezeigt. Erst nach einer Eingabe wurde er kurzzeitig als PS5 erkannt, nur um sofort wieder auf Xbox umzuschalten. Dazu kam noch ein nerviges Input-Delay, sodass ich jeden Befehl praktisch doppelt eingeben musste – auch hier hat nichts geholfen.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203349280,"If you have the time or patience to spare, I implore that you read the entire review. Everything I say here is simply my personal opinion. If you want, you can leave a comment, whether you agree or disagree with me, I'm down for reading whatever you say, as long as you're civil. Have a good day. :3

tl;dr: Maybe I thought about the ""herd-mentality"" haters much too harshly... Battlefield 2042 truly does feel to me like a disappointingly sub-par, uninspired 80gb heap of mediocrity, trodding around, wearing the Battlefield trademark. In my opinion, it wasn't even worth it for $3. However, I don't think that negative reviews, whether from others or my own, should dictate your opinions about this game. If you want to go ahead and try it out, we shouldn't be the ones to stop you. If you have fun, go ahead and have fun.

Battlefield 2042, overall, even after years of live service support trying to get it up to slightly above bare minimum standards, still feels... meh. And not the ""It'll do, I guess"" meh, it was 100% an ""This truly fails at providing fun for me"" meh. I experienced no *noticeable* bugs, and there were plenty gamemodes and servers to play... I just didn't have fun.

I got past the pretty annoying 'tutorial', played a few matches, both solo and MP, and then uninstalled and refunded. It just wasn't fun to me. Even with the class system brought back later on, I still felt too much like a one-man army and was disassociated from my squad, who I would usually communicate with... I tried my best, believe me, but I genuinely do think that this game feels too much like just some CoD Ground War match, just with 64/128 players.

I'm one of those few that don't think THAT badly about the operators. Yes, they were a massive departure from the Battlefield formula that DICE had been building over a dozen games for over two decades. Yes, they were a stupid trend-chasing attempt gone horribly wrong. Yes, it 100% ruins the squad-based teamwork that Battlefield has been known for. I understand everyone's qualms and hatred against operators. I personally, just, don't really care. I think that having operator-exclusive gadgets is an... alright... idea. They can be really fun, but from what I've seen, they don't really encourage teamwork, one of the main things Battlefield's loved and known for by many.

But, I digress. Let's talk about the weapons first. One of the most important parts of a first-person shooter game. Their animations are usually distractingly weightless and clunky, especially by modern standards, and worst of all, they don't really feel good to shoot. In my book, if you have a game about shooting with guns, the shooting with guns part better be good. But, it's not really good here. I mean, It's alright, I guess... but even the undeniably aging Battlefield: Bad Company 2 has better feeling weapons to me, and more importantly, that game FEELS like Battlefield.

Now, onto the game's artstyle. The overall artstyle lacks most of the grime and roughness that previous Battlefield games put on proud display. Even on the Iwo Jima map, a map set on the war-torn, muddy beaches of... well, Iwo Jima... it still feels much too clean and ""pretty"". All of the maps I played suffered with this exact issue. Too clean, too pretty, and too, for lack of a better term, cartoony. Battlefield 3 had extremely great looking maps that contrast directly towards 2042's. There was lots of dirt, grime, Michael Bay-esque lens flares, and the unique contrast and tint that create that subconscious but unshakable feeling that you're on a, well, Battlefield (HE SAID IT, HE SAID THE THING!). Battlefield 2042 lacks these things, and it makes the experience feel much too different than what I think a Battlefield game should be.

Everything feels so sub-par, uninspired and just not like Battlefield. I couldn't even keep playing for the Battlefield 6 rewards. I still wanted my refund, despite buying the game for $3. You'd be better off snagging Delta Force: Hawk Ops, and honestly, it's just the same shit but a different game. The only saving grace is that it's free to play, but be wary of Tencent/Team Jade's scummy practices, broken promises, and the absurd amount of microtransactions.

If you think differently than I do, I respect your opinion. I think that if you want to quickly try this out, you can 100% go ahead and try this out and refund if you didn't like it. I and the other people leaving negative reviews shouldn't be the ones to completely sway your opinion. If you like the game and think it's plenty fun, then you like the game and you think it's plenty fun. I don't want to spread hate or cause arguments because we have different opinions about something.

While I was actually one of those seven people who really liked the art direction of this game, the gameplay regressed way too much, especially considering the previous iteration - bfv, arguably had some of the best gameplay loops in the franchise.

Some noticeable problems were that movement felt worse (combat roll, crouch sprinting and laying on the back were sorely missed), gunplay was less precise and punchy, attrition and fortification system were removed, etc.

However, the worst tragedy that could happen to this game has to be the maps. They’re just generally terrible: big yet empty, with almost no cover between points. The biggest offender is definitely hourglass, you really have to experience it to see how bad it is. Exposure, on the other hand, worked pretty well in some of my conquest matches.

Now, for some positives (or at least neutral points):

I liked the near-apocalypse setting of the game and wish they had done more with it. The art style was neat and matched the empty maps well, though that was often more of a curse than a blessing.

I also didn’t mind features like on-the-fly attachment adjustments, tactical sprint, or specialists. I just see those as unique quirks of each bf entry.

The industrial soundtrack, which feels like a natural evolution from bf3 and bf4’s dubstep themes, was definitely the highlight of bf2042. It’s extremely atmospheric and distorted, which fit the setting perfectly.

In general, though, the gameplay left me with a sour experience despite the solid(?) presentation. Based on what I experienced in the two betas, bf6 already feels miles ahead of this one. Here’s hoping it stays that way.",False,0,8478

I'm new to the Battlefield franchise so i'll be review from a new player perspective from 30/08/2025 (2 days playing)

Is it good?
Yes. if compared to other BF games maybe not but coming from other games like COD, CS:GO/2, Fortnite, etc. .... it works just fine, it is a new experience unlike anyother i've played before, i like how different snipers behave here compared to the other games. this game is a tactical mess, meant to be Fun over Competitive.

Why people complain then?
most complains come from both the release of the game and in comparison to other BF games (BF3 and BF4 specifically)

Is it worth the price?
I paid 2.99, so yeah absolutely, 59,99 maybe not it's good but with battlefield 6 coming it is just not worth it.

would I recommend?
Yes but only and exclusively if under 9.99

(i did not play BF6 beta unfortunately, so i'm review BF 2042 not BF6, i plan on buying BF6 and maybe i'm never leaving BF franchise anymore if the changes promissed to BF6 actually hold, because i agree there is place for different games in the fps genre not every game needs to be a COD copycat)",True,0,4876

One of my favorite games was BF2142, then Bad Company 2, and then and still BF1. (If that game had bots, I'd probably never play another bf game honestly). I did really like a lot of BF5. I liked a lot of the mechanics in that one. I wished they'd make BF1 but with bots and mechanics of 5, but oh well. This game is a lot of fun and swapping weapon mods on the fly is super cool. The big selling point for me and my friends were the bots. They don't like playing with other players for the most part and I'm getting too old to be playing sweaty games lol. I just don't have it in me anymore, especially after chasing my kids around and working all day.

Would I recommend it? Yeah, I would. I think if you have a very specific case for it, it works great and it is a lot of fun to play. Playing online with people though makes it feel like COD, and I left those games a long time ago. Those games were basically spray and pray, run and gun, and DLC out the ass.

[*] The matchmaking in Battlefield 2042 feels terrible. You constantly run into max-level players who can kill you from miles away, while planes lock onto you and wipe you out in less than a second. Campers are everywhere, the movement and controls feel clunky, and flying aircraft has noticeable input delay. Gunplay feels unbalanced, you die instantly, yet it takes a full magazine to drop an enemy.

[*] The game looks great, but most of the player base seems to be veterans who already know every spot, weapon, and vehicle, leaving new or returning players at a huge disadvantage. It just doesn’t feel fun or fair. A possible fix could be level-capped servers (like max level 25 or 50) to create a more balanced experience. Right now, even as someone who has played Battlefield before, this just isn’t it.

I think it is insane that they released this game in the state that they did and thought: ""Oh yeah, this is going to be a game people are going to enjoy.""
People have been begging for years and years for a game that is grounded and feels similar to BF3 and BF4.

They did some of this in this game in BF3 portal modes, but that's pretty much it. It is unfortunate that they leaned into this agent/hero kind of game when it was already past their time.

Battlefield was always known for the destruction, massive maps and chaos all around. Some of the epicness obviously stays and I have felt genuine enjoyment out of this.

But again, it was 2.95 euro. If I paid 60 bucks for this game back when it released I'd be pissed.

Like many others, I was thrilled and excited when I saw the opportunity to earn weapon skins as rewards — both from missions in Battlefield 2042 and from the public playtest of Battlefield 6. I was especially happy knowing that I could claim these rewards now and wait to purchase Battlefield 6 later when it goes on sale. I usually buy each Battlefield title at a 50%–80% discount instead of at launch, because I know that early releases often come with bugs that take time to fix.

However, after completing the reward missions, I found out that there’s a strict time limit — you must log in to Battlefield 6 by March 31st, 2026 to receive the rewards. I think this is something many players may not be aware of.

A lot of people have spent significant time grinding for these rewards, some even farming XP in Portal mode just to complete the challenges. But like the official page says: If you don’t log in to Battlefield 6 by March 31st, 2026, all your efforts will be wasted.

no... after playing BF4, BF1, and the BF6 Open Beta, BF2042 doesn't even hold a candle to any of those games.

My opinion is heavily influenced by a specific issue that I has plagued my experience since launch. BF2042 can't read a multi-GPU setup. This had been an issue since launch and hasn't been fixed as of this post. This results in BF2042 ignoring graphics settings and selecting the weaker of the two options. This also prevents the game from being set to full screen for some reason. While this only affects some players and has a work around, those ""fixes"" don't work in my situation.

It is reading my CPU's Integrated Graphics as a GPU and ONLY uses that instead of letting my discrete GPU work. The common solution to this issue is to disable every other GPU except the one you want to use for the game (which is awful). This doesn't work as while disabling my GPU allows the game to full screen, I am playing with Integrated Graphics. This results in the need to downscale my game to 1280x720p and even then I am playing with less than 30fps. Disabling my CPU is more stupid as the game fails to launch without crashing.

Again, this problem doesn't occur in any other BF title and this has been a known issue since launch. Even ignoring this issue. The game is plagued with bad map layout and balance. The gimmick mechanics are just that, gimmicks. The Specialists hero characters are obviously trying to be ""cool"", but come off as cringe and pretentious. The vehicles feel both powerful and weak at the same time. Maybe it is a skill issue. Maybe it is because I am playing with less than 30fps.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203219041,"Let me skip to the end briefly: I've refunded my 2,99€ copy of BF2042. Let me tell you why.

I've only recently bought the game at an incredibly discounted price since there was a free season pass containing cosmetic content for the upcoming Battlefield 6 set to release on October the 10th this year. The last tier 60 is a quite good looking operator skin that I would have loved to get.
I was lucky I had the time to take part in both open beta weekends for BF6 and though there was a lot that I didn't like about the game, in the grand scheme of things they were minor details. Truth is I had a blast and now had to wait painfully until the full release of the main game.

This brought me to BF2042.
I closely followed the marketing and the release of the game in '21 and quickly determined there was nothing for me here. As a legacy BF fan I especially loathed the operator concept that replaced the unnamed soldiers of the old class system which even for the more open minded players quickly became a source of annoyance by means of incredibly cringe worthy voice lines you couldn't turn off.
The launch was plagued with technical difficulties, little content, low player numbers (they had to prop up their servers with bots to make them feel populated) and only a few and badly thought out maps.

I've been told the game had something of a renaissance since and by the looks of it it did retain a not too small constant player base. At least considering the appalling launch of the game.

However in my opinion it is still an absolute mess. There are dozens of better options out there to play at the moment and have been since '21. And I am not speaking of the absolute horror that the COD franchise has embarked on in recent years.

BF2042's state is a sad one. The maps are incredibly poorly designed, poor visibility, unintuitive terrain and routes as well as angles from which to be assaulted. They seem cluttered in places that need simplicity for gameplay reasons and simplicity that could do well with a bit of clutter for optical reasons. Most of the maps feel and look unfinished and empty. They have no character or soul like the legacy maps so loved by the community.

The gunplay is boring and unrewarding same as feeling a little random at times. There is not much to say about it and in this case thats not a good thing.

At least in my time of playtime I didn't notice blatant problems with the netcode.

Loading times where weirdly long, and the game seemed not at all well optimised.
The menu is a bloody mess. Apart from the colour grading of menu and UI (personal taste) which I detest it is difficult to navigate and hard to understand. Options for graphics and visuals surely could benefit from an example next to it to show off what the settings were manipulating. Basically a common feature nowadays.
The edit classes menu is horrendously bad to navigate, editing and equipping weapons seldom was so frustration inducing to me as it is in BF2042.

I disliked every minute I spent in this game and there is no battlepass in the world no matter how many nice skins for BF6 were in it that would convince me to ever touch this piece of waste of space on my harddrive again. Not if they would pay me for it.
Hardline was better than this.

Its far worse getting into elevators where your character cannot keep up with the speed of the lift. Gun play and hit registration is just the worst I have ever seen in a video game. I encouraged my friend to download this game because I figured maybe I wasn't having fun because NO ONE revives and the teams are always terribly matched with players that have never left the battlefield series on one side, and casual fps players on the other.

It's a huge disappointment, with empty, poorly designed maps that have lost the immersive feeling of previous titles. The core gameplay is fundamentally flawed, with weapons feeling as weak as a wet noodle. Piloting a tank feels less like a steel beast of destruction and more like a stationary piñata for every enemy engineer. Teamwork is almost non-existent, making it a frustrating experience to play with random teammates who seem to lack any awareness of objectives or the minimap. This unfinished experience feels as though it was released without a proper beta phase, which begs the question of how a game like this can be released with such a lack of content. It's a betrayal of the franchise's legacy and is certainly not one to recommend. This isn't the Battlefield we wanted, and it's a miracle if you can find a competent squad to play with.

From the moment I hit launch it immediately crashes to desktop. No error messages, no real explanation. Just silence. I tried troubleshooting, checked drivers, reinstalled, even looked into the bizarre “BIOS setting fixes” some players mentioned  but like many others I found absolutely nothing that worked. And honestly in 2025 why should a AAA title require players to tinker with BIOS just to get past the start menu?

It’s not just a bug. It’s a betrayal of trust. We paid full price (or not) for a game that feels less like a product and more like an experiment dumped on the community. The worst part? The forums and social spaces are full of similar complaints and yet the silence from the developers is deafening.

Battlefield has always been about epic scale, immersion and unforgettable moments with friends. Battlefield 2042 instead has become unforgettable for the wrong reasons: broken promises, endless crashes and players locked out of even experiencing the game.

At this point Battlefield 2042 isn’t a “live service.” It’s a “dead on arrival” service. Until the developers acknowledge these issues and deliver a real fix this title deserves to be remembered not as a groundbreaking shooter but as one of the most disappointing releases in modern gaming.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has the elements of a battlefield game; large scale assault with vehicles, opportunities to have fun moments.
When you actually take a look at the infantry gameplay and compare it to other battlefield games, you can see they tried to take some notes from CoDs playbook. 

Infantry move faster with more movement-based gameplay compared to other battlefield games with tactical sprint, sliding and some operators even having grappling hooks or wingsuits. Many of the guns themselves also feel more toy-like with worse gun sounds and forgiving recoil compared to the other entries of the series. 

I touched on it there, but they have operators instead of the strict class system that we know and love. I do not like it.
A lot of the more tame abilities of these operators could honestly just have been class-locked gear you could equip: spotting drone, mini-map interference ""pylon"" etc. Meanwhile, others could have been pick-ups around the map like they had with the explosive shotguns back in BF4 (""Lissile"" the TV guided missile, minigun emplacement etc.)
Other than that, it also doesn't make me feel like it's Russia vs USA since they both apparently decided to purchase the same PMC group to wage war against itself. 

The operators also all have skins to unlock or buy if you're feeling that your wallet is becoming too heavy. Which doesn't help with the loss of identity since suddenly a masked cyberpunk dude is launching rockets at me. Also had battle passes, but now you can buy some of these skins through the store directly since the seasons are over.

The vehicle grind is just like any other battlefield game where you need to get kills in the vehicles before you can even have a viable vehicle to play. I decided to grind in Solo games trying not to waste the vehicles on me in actual live games, but suddenly realized that the unlocks don't carry over to the Russian vehicle counterparts, even though they have the same exact abilities, with the country-unique gunships being the exception. 
The big issue here is that when playing Solo they decided to make you play US on every map. It wasn't like this before, where you would on some maps play Russia, but now they force you to grind the Russian counterparts in actual live games. 

All in all I can't say it's a [i] bad [/i] game, but it's not exactly an amazing [i] Battlefield [/i] game. It feels EA had an identity crisis when directing this game. It is still a lot of fun though, at least for me since I do enjoy some more fast-paced shooters.",True,1,3962

Despite the numerous updates this game has received it still has terrible issues that plague it from being fun.


Those being:

- This game probably has the most unskilled playerbase in the history of battlefield. Prepare for a lot of engineers not destroying vehicles, medics reviving you in fire, recons being useless, and assaults acting like this is call of duty. I am an average gamer who has only returned to gaming from a 2 year hiatus and can easily find myself in the top 5 - 8 on a team.
- Specialist system is still in place. This means that there will be a large number of players that look exactly like you because they are using the same specialist. Specialists are not only very trouble some as a concept, they are also poorly designed both gameplay wise and aesthetically.
- Maps fucking suck. They are far too big even for the 64 player mode, so there is a lot of dead time. Kaleidoscope is the worst offender and will make you feel like you're in a dead game (don't worry, you are) with how empty the map can feel.
- Guns have the worst feedback in any battlefield title. Sound design lacks any punch, the recoil is non existent, the guns bloom in accuracy like crazy, the reload animations suck, the modification system is terrible. To top it all off, nearly all the guns are original designs which make no sense and are hideous.",False,0,5181

1) Some maps are too wide, resulting in non-stop flanking, which requires you to keep rotating your mouse 720 degrees, as there is no certainty of where the enemy can be.
2) Some maps also have multiple levels, with 2-3 storey housing peppered all over the place. This creates passive gameplay, where both sides end up camping the houses and waiting for kills to arrive - not interactive.
3) Some maps too narrow and have only 3-4 chokepoints that can be pushed, meaning both teams are throwing gazillion of nades and spamming bullets into the chokepoints, which are then immediately replenished by the Support class gadgets. In this way nothing happens for 20 minutes.

I am yet to play a map that feels good or has some logical design.

It does introduce some cool systems that I hope future games adopt, like customizing your gun on the go (Assuming you set it up properly beforehand). 

Minimal performance issues on my end. Ryzen 7 5700X and RTX 4070 with 32GB  3600 cl16 ram. Stutter happens only at the start of the round if it's on a map I've never played before, so just general shader building stuff.  In the 7 or so hours I've played, I only had one issue where I couldn't move my mouse after getting rezzed. Was fine once I died and redeployed and it never happened again.

Audio is garbage. Reviewers weren't kidding when they said the music in here is fucking shit. The guns also do not sound anywhere near as good as BF1, 5 and 6. Footsteps sound fine. Better than 5 even if I'm being honest.  Also why does the main menu not have music? BF1 and V had some of their best tracks playing there. Granted, after what I've heard of their score so far, I guess we should be thankful that the main menu has no music lmfao.

UI is horrendous. You'll know what I mean when you're scrolling through your guns. Needless scrolling and  clicking. 

Gameplay is a bit mixed, leaning negative. I like the customization and I think it's the deepest customization Battlefield has ever gotten. However, the process of actually shooting the damn gun, whether infantry or vehicular, leaves a lot to be desired. It's lacking that punch that past titles had. Most guns I've used, which were the starter guns, tended to have laser accurate shots too, so kills are a tad less satisfying.

Building on the gameplay, the maps are gigantic, more suited for 64 v 64. At the same time, 128 players can get messy as all hell. It also doesn't feel like Battlefield anymore when everyone's sliding around and twitch shooting. Really feels like a Call of Duty game most of the time I'm playing. There's just too many bone headed aggressive plays I've made and had them work to not draw the COD comparison. If I played the same way in 1 and 5 I'd just get murdered. Oh also, I notice the very distinct lack of building destruction. In fact, I'd go so far as to say there is no building destruction. Lame.

I am leaning positive towards the specialist system, but to my understanding it was different at launch and the game had no classes at all. Nevertheless, having them contribute differently can give players more stuff to do in the long run while also opening up more ways to play the game. But seeing as specialists aren't really the ""heart"" of Battlefield as some call it, just carry forward the special tools choice selection without all the cringe characters and voicework.

Still, at 95% off it's hard to say no. I've spent more on a bad meal and I'm sure you have too. Just buy it and try it out. It'll almost be the gateway to a different Battlefield if you like the formula and have never tried a single game in the franchise.

If I had to give this game a final score, it's probably a 3/10 or 4/10 for me. I'm only 7 hours in and I'm kinda already fed up with the game lmfao. It's extremely unlikely I'll return to it after I'm done unlocking stuff on the free season pass. But again, it's 95% off.",True,1,3614

It feels like a Chinese f2p BF clone.
Spawns are shit (not takling about squad spawning obviously shit head - talking about general placement spawns. Common to be spawning in enemy line of fire)
Guns don't have that umph factor
Zoom in bug frequently occuring during ADSing and then die & respawn
Dumbfuck mechanics that are added to make the game more ""convenient"" trivialize the identity of the series and dilute it into same congealed mass

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203080318,"Pricing really dictates the value of the purchase for this one. In my eyes the battlefield series, even at its worst is better than the last 5-10 years of call of duty, with some exceptions here and there. Battlefield 2042 at times reminds me why i think so strongly about which game series i prefer out of the two, however in regards to the quality of the peak battlefield games, this game does not get close consistently. At times it feels close to the quality of battlefield 4, and then others it feels like something similar to battlefield hardline, not so much in how it plays but more so that it feels like a black sheep. 

The good:
the game runs very well

sound design is great 

graphics are really good 

moment to moment gameplay CAN BE fantastic

There's a decent amount of content in there, and there's also little to no microtransactions which for ea is mad

the controversial ability to change attachments in game is great in my opinion. I love the idea that i can flank an enemy team, distracted by my teammates, and switch to having a suppressor right then and there, then clearing out a bunch of enemies, and taking the silencer off again and attaching an acog scope to my gun, to go loud and shoot enemies at a distance with maximum damage. It's a cool concept and one that i felt worked, however i understand that this feels to easy to some

The bad:
map design ranges from pretty decent to outright poor, and I feel like there's more of the latter than the former. The big problem in the games map design is how almost narrow things can feel. A lot of these maps can bottleneck your team or the other, leading to things feeling very unbalanced in your favour or against you. I sometimes come out of games feeling like i was handed the win, however if i start on the other side of certain maps, i feel like the games already over before its started. I feel like this issue could have been partially averted through the means of SBMM. If the game was to analyse players most recent matches to determine their skill level, you could partially fill out teams (depending on who starts on the unbalanced side of the maps) with some of the best players in the lobby. This would ensure that whilst one team would still face an uphill challenge, they'd at least have a fighting chance.

Timed modes. Hate this. This live service style of only giving you game modes or playlists when the game deems it acceptable. Rush is arguably my favourite mode in battlefield, and the second most popular mode only to conquest, and yet it's now became a timed match type, so whilst i can play breakthrough or team deathmatch whenever i want, i have to wait a week or so for the modes to change again, and hope that rush is featured this week. I hate that, because i happen to be busy the week my favourite mode makes it appearence. I may have to wait another week or so before i get the chance to play it again.


soldier classes have been changed in a way that makes all classes feel pointless. In older battlefield games i would have to make a decision as to which class i wanted because classes used to have their own specific gun type that the other classes couldn't use. If i want to be a medic, who carries health that not only heals me but my teammates, I'd have to go with the support class, but the support class soldiers would only use SMG's, so i'd have to forfeit the ability to use the LMG or assault rifle, or sniper rifle. If i wanted to be the class that carried around ammo boxes to restock myself and teammates, i'd have to be the heavy class who was restricted to LMG's and so on. 2042 changes this and makes it so all classes can use all gun types, meaning there's almost no sense of sacrifice, or encouragement to experiment. I feel like this leads to weapons not feeling as intriguing. I don't have the motivation to try guns i may never have used, when i can just pick any class and carry on using the weapons i've already gravitated to. this design philosophy is part of what gave battlefield it's identity and losing it makes the game feel less like battlefield and more like every other shooter online game. 

server browser is relegated to portal mode as opposed to the main game modes which i absolutely despise. Essentially server browser has been an incredibly useful tool that ensured that as the game begins to lose its playerbase, you'd still be able to easily join a borderline full lobby with ease. It also ensured you could play the maps you wanted and the mode you wanted it to be. This is now gone, meaning it's never exactly what you want. Fans have complained about this since the games release, however dice has responded by doing the exact same thing for battlefield 6, so that's annoying. 

At it's best battlefield 2042 is an 8.5/10 but at its worst its a 5. I'd say overall the game sits anywhere from a 6.5/10 or a 7/10. it is pretty good and for the price, if you can get it under £10 its worth the cost. it's also the most active battlefield at the moment. However if you're looking for the best battlefield games you can still play online today with varying active communities, i'd recommend games like battlefield 1, battlefield 4 (which is older than battlefield 1. Makes no sense but yeah) and battlefield 3 (also older than battlefield 1) they are the peaks for battlefield online in my opinion. That being said you'd have to buy dlc if you bought those games to get all ther content. One decent thing about this game is that the majority of added content was free, maps included

When a new Battlefield game comes out, everyone has something to complain about. EVERY Battlefield game was always released too early; the product still has to mature some time. That's how it's always been, and that's how it will be with Battlefield 6.

But we're talking about Battlefield 2042 here. I've been there since the beginning, and it was a really difficult start. But DICE never gave up on Battlefield 2042. All the maps were reworked, and the classes came back halfway. All in all, a lot of work was put into it, and today Battlefield 2042 is a fantastic game!

-there doesn't seem to be any spread which makes weapons much more precise at range and the TTK way too low
-the whole UI is hella confusing
-most maps I played suck; they may be nice aesthetically but that doesn't guarantee good gameplay
-somehow, I had the most fun on a custom 128 player server with bots which isn't really a Battlefield experience

It's surely playable on a Nvidia Geforce RTX 3070 TI (which is what I have) but it does lag a bit during intense moments. Moving on, the UI is actually really nice. The menus are easy to navigate and I had no problem with them. The guns play a lot like Call Of Duty, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. There is things like tactical sprint and sliding but it's not as extreme as Call Of Duty. The specialists kinda make this game a hero shooter but only to a certain extent. I do like the original class system better but it is what it is. The maps are kinda bland at times in certain areas and some of them are a bit larger than they should be.

Do not buy Battlefield 2042

DICE\EA know how to make a “Battlefield” game.
DICE\EA made trailers that promoted this game.
> DICE\EA inserted all the “only in Battlefield” moments in to the Trailer
DICE\EA knew that this game is missing all of the below features.
DICE\EA still released this.

A lot of the missing features come from a reddit post, I added a list of my ""Broken"" experiences. I only wanted to use this list to prove my opening statement.
Battlefield 2042 subreddit and Jellyswim_


No offense was intended, I just wanted to leave my review this morning on the cut content and what a poor ""Battlefield"" this was.

Missing from Vehicles

> No squad field upgrades
> No in-game VOIP
> Fewer factions (with almost nothing to give the 2 factions any distinction)

> Less detail in the 'who killed you' screen
> No ultrawide monitor support. Cannot move UI elements to suit screen size
> Very poor friend joining system

BROKEN
> 45 tick rate servers
> Rubberbanding
> Deploy bugs, revive bugs. Downed state bug that prevents you from being revived if you clip through anything. There times where you have no countdown and cannot respawn
> Janky animations
> Performance is horrible on PC. Unplayable framerates from what looks like CPU bottlenecking
> Unlock three different silencers for the same weapon that have no effect on the stats of the weapon
> Exact same attachment on two different guns having an opposite effect
> Hovercrafts are able to scale vertical surfaces, as well as fly in the right circumstances.
> In rare cases, a player will become unable to damage enemies. This player will also lose their nameplate, causing them to appear as hostile to allies. This is fixed by dying and respawning.
> Broken Bullet Registration
> Broken Bullet Spread
> Broken Weapon Balance
> Broken Vehicle Balance

Besides that, from a casual gamer standpoint, the game isn't bad. The aesthetics are mostly pretty vibrant and interesting, and the combat is exciting. Shooting feels ok, if not slightly lacking in power. Feels more like a free-to-play game, though, if I'm being honest. There's not even a campaign. And (and this is just my personal taste), I'm not big on these ""slightly futuristic"" worlds -- it lacks the grim and grimy feel, but also isn't something sleek and otherworldly like Halo.

Nothing works. There is no excuse for a company as massive as EA to release something that doesn't work for so many people. I see a lot of people have this exact issue with the game. It's pathetic.


Gameplay:
Since, I am able to launch the game I played a few hours. The gunplay is okay, but feels very fast and more like Call of Duty than Battlefield. Bring back the weighty combat of BF3/4 please.
All classes being able to heal/revive is stupid. 
Vehicles are stupid easy to take down because every launcher in the game is basically hit scan. Snipers/launchers have barely any bullet drop.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,203011725,"I really hate the fact they added cosmetics to grind out for BF6 within BF2042, I really have to push myself to keep playing it for those cosmetics

Honestly overall BF2042 had a lot of potential but the execution is just horrid even 4 years post release while the majority of bugs are fixed (still a few remaining) the game just isn't fun

Battlefield is normally known for its great audio. As in great sound effects, great directional sound quality and great music. In all aspects BF2042 is a failure, the music is annoying, the menu background sound is annoying and the sound effects are annoying. They consist out of a bunch of random beeps some of which I honestly still haven't figured out what they mean. I feel like sometimes BF2042 just randomly beeps for no reason. While the overall audio just sounds very muffled and it makes it generally hard to figure out the position of the enemies even with my directional headset which performs insanely well on Apex Legends, BF6 Beta, CoD, R6 Siege and even Marvel Rivals. Yet in BF2042 I struggle to figure out where the footstep sounds are coming from as the quality of the directional sound is just horrid in this game

Bad sound aside, the gameplay just is very boring and repetitive a big part of this comes from the absolutely horrid map designs. Here I was thinking CoD maps are bad, BF2042 makes even the worst CoD maps seem like GOTY maps. Fortunately BF6 maps are substantially better and even my least favourite maps in the beta are far more enjoyable than the best maps in BF2042. I really just don't know what they were thinking with the map designs on BF2042 and clearly they underwent little to no playtesting and if they did then only thing I can figure is that it was tested by non-gamers and they were like yeah this is fine, not like we have any comparison point but these maps are absolutely fine

The poor gun handling and broken hit reg was infamous at launch. Hit reg is mostly fixed there are occasions where hit reg still goes absolutely wonky. The main issue is the guns just generally don't feel nice to shoot which is kind of a core thing on FPS games and part of why CoD has remained so popular as even with their worst entries the one consistent factor is that the weapons are very satisfying to use. In BF2042 you just constantly feel like you are fighting your own guns rather than enjoying them and it isn't even the TTK/TTD as BF2042 has an even faster TTK than BF6 beta did but it just is the way the guns feel is just very unsatisfying and somehow annoying

Lastly vehicles play a big part of the BF franchise and yet another thing this game somehow manages to completely botch. All the vehicles feel very floaty. They lack weight/mass and generally look weird when they move around regardless if you are in a vehicle or seeing someone else in a vehicle be it enemy or ally

The scales are also all messed up, some vehicles that should be much larger than others are somehow smaller and vice versa. While jets normally are a challenge to deal with in Battlefield here they fly so slow that it yet again looks downright bizarre but also means they are very easy to take down especially with anti-air guns. But it looks like the jets are literally moving in slow motion and in fact some of the game's helicopters are actually faster than the jets lol!

Here and there you do find moments of Battlefield fun but they are very rare. I think if I had to pick one thing that would have made this game much more fun it would be the maps. I don't actually believe that operators ruin this game and oddly enough it is one of the few things I actually enjoy about BF2042 as it sets it apart from the other BF games. But the main issue is really just the maps are horrid

The second main issue is the gunplay but better maps really would have made this game hit much better with the fanbase I believe as it is really the maps that honestly makes it so much more painful to push through the free pass for the BF6 cosmetics

On a side note, if you ever want to know what GamerGate is really about. It is about gamers criticising mainstream video game critics for taking bribes to write positive reviews. PC Gamer gave this game 80/100 and mind you that was not now after years of updates that was based on the launch product which was completely broken and unplayable across all platforms. Ironically enough look at all the recent articles from PC Gamer about BF2042 they all say how bad the game was and remains to be. GamerGate on full display there

(Yes I know there is a claim that GamerGate is the collective harassment of female journalists, but where do you think that narrative came from in the first place? Perhaps from the very same websites that were being criticised for faking their review scores for under the table bribes. The bulk of the reviews that were criticised were written by men, not women!)",False,3,6237

Overall, the game is okay. It's not the best Battlefield game, has a lot of issues, but also has some pretty cool ideas.

I shockingly enjoy the specialist system. While I prefer Battlefield to make me feel like just another soldier in the war, 30 of the same distinct looking guy running around is distracting, and the cringe voicelines (that have thankfully been removed) were cringe, the utility they bring to the matches is pretty sick. I love being able to wingsuit around on bigger maps, drop a turret, or shoot team mates with a heal gun. I'm honestly going to miss some of these abilities come BF6. 

Some of the maps are cool, others are awful. Some of the guns feel bad, some feel amazing. The futuristic art direction feels a little underwhelming. The destruction isn't nearly as impactful as prior entries.

This game is actually so very fun, to extreme degrees.
It plays so smoothly and feels great.
There's so many different choices of weapons, equipment and classes.
And it works really well, it doesn't have the squad connectivity issues that we had on Battlefield 1, which I also love.

It's getting so many negative reviews, but it seems like the reasons while being valid, aren't that the game is not fun
The reasons are that the game used to have issues at launch, and despite them being fixed, lots of the reviews remained unchanged.
And another reason seems to be that many are giving negative review because of the anticheat, and it needing secure boot on.

I understand that many don't want to be restricted, though on a windows system you can easily run with secure boot on and enjoy the very fun game.
I wish it wasn't needed so that people wouldn't have problems.

But despite the bad launch, and the anti-cheat needing more strict measures which can be good from some aspects, I have to admit and put it out there that the game is very much worth playing. 

If you like a shooter with lot's of customisation and futuristic aspects, I 100% would recommend this. 
And it's so much better than something like CoD that I see very little reason someone would buy those instead of this.

Today in 2025: After being beaten into submission and forced through endless nights, the dev team has finally dragged this thing to where it should have been on day one.

Guns all feel good to use, and the change EA made to the operators to make them more like old school BF is nice (I never played early on when they were more like heroes). Vehicles don't feel too overpowered, maps are mostly fun (there are a couple I'm not a fan of so far), and all the classic BF modes are present and enjoyable.

While its true that this game is much better than the product delivered at launch, this is not what I want to expect when I think of a Battlefield title. It's obvious that EA had some other kind of hero shooter/br planned before we got whatever this is. 

My review might have been swayed to positive if the matchmaking in this game delivered on any level whatsoever. Lack of a server browser with persistent servers is just a shame. Even if there was no server browser besides the portal browser, (which is just full of xp farms btw) persistent servers would at least let me play the game without running the same map 3x in a row. On top of that, within 2 hours of playing I joined 3 matches that were within 5 minutes of ending, and then got kicked right back out to the main menu to wait another minute to play on the same map.

The map reworks and class system, that were added far too late into the games lifespan, do help appease some of the bigger issues this game had at launch, and I've found myself enjoying the newer maps and vehicles, especially with a squad. But the lows seem to overtake the highs enough for me to quit mid match.

Ultimately, this game will most likely die within the next year, so I salute the devs for their commitment and hard work to a product that executives doomed to fail from the very start.

This game feels closer to Call of Duty, but I don't want to play Call of Duty, I want to play Battlefield. Aside from failing the vibe check, there are a variety of other issues.

The UI is a nightmarish chore to navigate. How do I unlock X operator? No idea, I can't hover it to find out. Instead I have to google it and hope to find a rough answer (I can't even look up the specific character because you can't see the names of locked characters). 

Speaking of unlocking things, this game's weapon progression [i]sucks[/i]. You unlock guns in a seemingly random order by just levelling up in general, unlike in previous Battlefield games, where you unlock weapons for a class by playing the class, which was much better—people are going to have their favourite class or two, and that system made it so that each weapon you unlocked while playing felt like something to actually look at, rather than this one, where I have to unlock several guns that I will likely never use in order to get X weapon that I want.

I hate the maps in this game. They just feel bad to play on, and they look... lazy...
In the previous games, the maps felt like places that would have actually served a purpose for the people using them—little towns, resorts, military bases... in 2042, I can hardly tell what a place was supposed to be and/or how it got to the state that it's in. Like the sports arena almost entirely submerged in sand at an angle. That doesn't at all feel like a real context which could emerge twenty years from now (also playing on the map sucks).

This game isn't as half bad as people make it out to be.
After some fixing here and there, this game is actually decent and fun.

The gunplay is smooth and snappy

The character movement is smooth and allows for more accessibilty in some of the more open maps and thanks to it, controlling your foot soldier is a streamlined experience.
Vehicle movement is an actual improvement from the previous installments of the franchise and personally I strongly believe that the overall movement is a strong point of this game, because you fight the enemies and not the janky rubberband'ish controlls like in many other shooters.

Graphics/Audio-wise it's pretty much a classic Frosbite-Battlefield standard since the Battlefield 1.

It's a mix of a classic Battlefield experience with a somewhat modernistic approach to the title.

If there was something that I didn't like, it probably would be the weird setting implementation, but otherwise its a pretty fun ""kickback and fool around"" shooter game.

First the EA anti cheat didn’t work and then I had to go change my boot order in my bios, just to fuck around in a few matches of Battlefield. This might all be a norm now, I don’t know, but it didn’t leave a good first impression. When I finally got it to launch, it took its sweet ass time loading in. They added some very annoying unskippable cutscenes for those who launch for the first time and it is so slow at loading in between them. I waited more than 10 minutes from hitting play till I ended up in the menu. But I did get it to work in the end, I guess.

When loading into games it felt like every second server crashed and it was really slow at loading when a game wouldn’t connect to the server. Queue times are quick though, even for the 128 player conquest, it is usually less than a minute queue per match, so that was good.

The game does feature an ingame store with microtransactions and battle passes, though I didn’t feel like it was something that was thrown in my face. I actually did have to go look for it to check it out. So I guess that is another positive?

I spent more time on fixing issues and in loading screens than I have actually spent playing, so I don’t see myself “playing” anymore of it and therefore I refunded it.

This game is sorta-at the end of its life and with BF6 around the corner and I'm not going to lie the current -free battlepass- offered giving skins for that game did entice me to give it a shot. 

 To solidify the opinions of me and my other dollarstore brother-in-arms that I purchased the game along side (within my friend group) it's fun, it's not particularly groundbreaking but it's fun with friends. We don't really go for hero shooters so the partitioned gadgetry and the silly costumes in concert with the characters that just-blend together kind of makes the experience all-sorta bland, occasionally I'll see a jet or a tank zip by with some immersion challenging color or novelty camo and it sort of just takes me right out, nevermind the endless sea of skull-facemasks and candy-coated tacticoolarmor, the guy who just t-bagged you has a gold-plated m1911 with a billion attachments and pearl furniture.  For anyone who's skeptical that it is a hero-shooter variant to Battlefield The engineer with the sentrygun wont stop calling out how an ""enemy hero""is in the AO when I soypog point and spot an enemy.  

I understand we're a far-cry from Bad Company 2 multiplayer and with the beta of 6 fresh on the mind it's nice to see the roots I enjoy sort-of come back. I know we're on a timer here until some really whack cosmetics come and knock things out of the things I like about the game. 

The guns feel fine, the vehicles are fine, the character kits while oddly partitioned are fine. Just because I hopped onto a life-raft and scaled the Titanic to hear the band play one last song doesn't mean you should join me, you could get like a couple of sodas or like a snack from a gas-station for that price, Ask yourself is the mild-annoyance of grinding a battlepass for a gasmask on one class worth your favorite candybar?

Holy hell, if you told me two years ago, that in 2025 I would be playing BF2042 all day long like I played BF3 and 4, I would call you a son of a b**** and a liar. I'd curse your family. But here I am having a blast. I haven't had this much fun in a Battlefield game since BF4. I have had a great time playing the various Conquest modes, Breakthrough, and AI bot matches. There's even some servers that run 16 players vs hordes of AI. It's a meatgrinder and it's seriously fun. That was the kind of stuff I loved about the oldest Battlefield games, 1942, Vietnam, 2, and 2142. The gunplay is solid, the maps are fun, the sounds effects are punchy, the movement is slick and intuitive, the UI is tolerable with custom colors (I use solid Blue vs Red instead of Cyan and Orange, and a Half-Life amber for the HUD.) It also kinda feels like a GI Joe game with the slightly futuristic vehicles. I just wish each team had completely different looks for the Specialists. That would have been really cool.

I believe Battlefield 2042 has a lot of what i love about the franchise: While destruction has taken a step back in the wrong direction and the characters are out of touch cheesy, none of that takes away from the cinematic chaos and stressfull cooperation while bullets fly, i also adore the bigger 128 player maps with huge variety in the different zones. And the addition of things like tornadoes and wingsuits takes the Battlefield experience i fell in love with and dials it to a Tenet level 11. I love it, and i will sorely miss those parts as we switch to Battlefield 6.

Look, I don't know what kind of futuristic magic DICE used to make this game, but every time I hop into Battlefield 2042, I feel like I'm starring in my own action movie—except the plot is mostly just me accidentally parachuting into enemy tanks.

The world’s largest maps? Check. The most ridiculous gadgets that somehow work in my favor? Check. And don’t even get me started on the storm clouds of doom—nothing says ""living on the edge"" like being in the middle of a firefight and suddenly realizing you're caught in a literal tornado.

Every time I think I have a grip on the game, I get sniped from the sky by a helicopter pilot that’s clearly practicing for Top Gun 3. But that's the beauty of it, isn’t it? It’s chaotic, unpredictable, and even when things go terribly wrong, I have a blast (pun intended).

So, if you love big guns, massive explosions, and accidentally ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time—this game is for you. If not, well, you're missing out on some of the most fun you can have in a digital warzone. Highly recommend!",True,0,2097

Battlefield 2042,1517290,202848549,"In Summary: I'd have rather gone to queue at the bank for 2 hours than deal with this s***. At least I'd have accomplished something in the end. 

Never in my 39 years of existence was I asked to enter into and adjust the setting on my f****** BIOS just to get a game TO LAUNCH!

I bought this game yesterday for 3eur and somehow it launched on first go, I had an arguably decent first round and turned it off and walked away. Yet my mild enjoyment must have been clearly signalled to the platform and EA sought immediate remedial action to correct this untenable situation. Come a few hours later. I try launching again and the whole drama begins. ""Error, it may be something on our side, please check account"" - you're god **** right it was. After 2 hours of trying to launch the game and troubleshooting that literally kept sending me round in circles between EA, Steam, a dozen of logins, reinstalling the game, claiming ownership on either platform and finally my bleeding BIOS because of some secure boot BS, I decided to put an end to this insanity.

What happened to gaming? Why does the launching and everything leading up to the gameplay feel like I'm opening a bank account with a north korean passport?? Seriously, this needs to end. EA and its garbage need to dissolve on the surface of the sun and be joined by similar games/studios.

I dare EA to prove me wrong with BF6, I guarantee they will take this challenge seriously as they know who I am and what a considerably destructive force I could represent to their operation.

Nevertheless I still get great satisfaction doing this each time and still think I'm getting tremendous value somehow.

But I actually enjoy this game quite a lot. I have way more fun than frustration or annoying moments and this will be a good hold in until Bf6 comes out! Is it a GOOD battlefield? Honestly it still does feel like battlefield but only in terms of vehicles included on large maps with chaotic ""battlefield moments"" this game still has that so IMHO yes in a way but.. This game definitely has an identity crisis for a battlefield but imo.. I am enjoying it still it's fun for what it is you just can't go into this expecting it to be like Bad Company, BF3 or 4 or even like 5 or 1 this just feels like the battlefield they wanted to go another direction with and imo I think they did okay in that aspect.

NOW.. for my gripe with this game.. holy the TTK is INSANE for EVERY gun.. not a terrible thing.. this just means every gun can be good BUT this also means no gun really has an identity in that class of guns and I can see how this can get really dry. The only real difference is 1 or 2 bullets to kill, slight mag size difference, the fire rate and SLIGHT recoil/accuracy differences. Like you can just grab any gun in a specific class put a scope on it and it won't feel much different from most of the guns in that class. I honestly have to say this is probably the EASIEST battlefield with the gunplay which can be a good or bad thing.

The hero system for characters I am not gonna lie I HATED it at first I still kind of do deep down but when you view this game as the ""different"" battlefield and you see the balance for how the game is built around this system it isn't really that bad even if it's really odd for a battlefield. I much prefer if battlefield would go the route of having the bf5 style customization (why doesn't more have that?) and then maybe have the special class abilities on top of each player customized character instead of hero's THAT would have been tons better imho.

Honestly when this game is on sale I say get it why not? At full price I don't think it would be super worth it unless you are craving this kind of game. If you have played Delta Force (this is just a better Delta Force honestly) or enjoy faster paced larger scale fps game's this is still a pretty okay game and fun!",True,3,5250

Battlefield 2042,1517290,202824744,"Literally only playing it for the BF6 items but since I'm dumping my time into it, I might as well give the same time for a review.

This game is bleak, boring, and the reason Battlefield as a brand almost died.  Let's hope nobody from this mess is helping with the Battlefield 6 game.  My overall score for this title is a 4.0/10, my lowest to date on any review of a major game release.

Graphics:  7/10

The game looks fine, aged decent enough I guess, It's nothing really to write home about, the guns look detailed, the ""operators"" ugly faces are all detailed, sound design is passable, environmental destruction is some of the weakest I've seen in a Battlefield title.  There's nothing to praise here, but also nothing to really dig in on, so this portion gets to be short.

Gameplay: 3/10

Most Boring Battlefield Ever.  Operators is a terrible idea removing the anonymous soldiers that once roamed the franchise's maps, now you get to be ""Boris"" or ""Dozer"" and feel absolutely zero personal attachment to your character.  Customization options are just reskins, characters are bland, boring, and 'diverse', meaning every race and gender is represented in the most dull, boring, corporate way possible.  The gunplay is weak, occasionally giving you a taste of nostalgia with BF3 guns ported in, but the 2042 base weapons are either awkward, weak, or just dull.  The best maps of the game are ported in from older games, vehicles are basically worthless, and the infusion of 'futuristic technology' only serves to take away from the fun, rather than add to it.

Multiplayer:  6/10

Online lobbies are standard, the game is still sorta buggy, netcode is terrible and you'll get shot behind cover, through the earth, or as soon as you spawn.  Many maps offer large open lanes which favor Recon more than anything, but when the fighting does go urban or compact, fear not, because the netcode is so poor you can hold a corner and die to an enemy before they even round it on your end.  Prepare to spawn on your teammates to get instakilled because the ""Combat"" detector isn't working properly, or just join the grind, spawn as a Recon, grab a spotting drone, and grind points the entire match flying around.  As a BF3 and BF4 Veteran, this is some of the weakest multiplayer I've participated in to date.

Overall this game is just a sad excuse in an expensive jacket.  It's not fun, it's not engaging, I felt zero dopamine despite winning matches with 40+ kills, destroying vehicles, or getting multi-kills.  I don't know how they managed to accomplish this, honestly.  If you're like me and you're only after the Battlefield 6 content, don't spend more than the $3 you have to.  If you're not here for BF6 content, don't even waste the $3, take that money and go to 7-11 and buy a soda, that way your brain can at least enjoy some dopamine when the sugar hits you.

The summary is this:

It's a weird, weird Battlefield like the other weird Battlefields that came before it. 128 players is where it shines, the one defining feature like all of the other weird Battlefields and their defining features.

Every generation we get a Battlefield game that does something different and alienates the majority of the community. There was Vietnam, there was Battlefield 2 Special Forces, which some of the community didn't like because of its small scale and infantry focus (like Battlefield 6), there was 2142, there was Bad Company 1 and Bad Company 2 (considered by many not to be a real Battlefield), then Battlefield Hardline. 2042 definitely fits that niche of off the beaten path Battlefields.

I'm addressing the community's negatives first:

-The heroes: Completely bullshit and as everyone says just a vehicle for skins, but I actually like the mechanic in itself. Rather than the game just having the classic 4 basic classes you've essentially got 16 of them in function. If you're the type of player that likes different type of support styles, there's an ammo focused one, one capable of immediately healing, one that can build barricades. All of the classes function in this way. AND IT WORKS.

-The open weapons: Considered a major sin, I think the series actually *needs* open weapons because for decades now Battlefield has been stuck with the problem that different weapons are objectively better, or that the classes themselves get pigeon holed in certain combat roles based on the weapon they're assigned. No more being stuck with a weapon you don't like to play or doesn't work for the map because of your class.

-The lack of destruction and levolution: It is what it is. It can absolutely be a deal breaker but at the same time you don't have to worry about all of the cover being destroyed 5 minutes into a round like the other games in the series. There are supposed to be severe weather effects but I haven't encountered any besides some typhoon weather that didn't seem to influence the match at all.

-The aesthetic: It's a blend of near future modern and weird sci fi bullshit. It doesn't work for me at all. You have dark colors with bright LEDs and an ugly ass, bright HUD. Horrible.

But besides those things, I think the game does some things right:

-128 players is something the community has wanted for decades. This mode is interesting because the maps are way too big (like the people complaining about Battlefield 6 want). Sometimes it works horribly, but when it works it provides a unique experience that I don't think another Battlefield is going to capture again. There is a plethora of vehicles. There are so many people playing each class that it you don't need to pick one because there's an imbalance (which is still the least picked class it seems). And the best part is that is what you do individually doesn't matter at all because at this scale there's very little an individual player or even squad can do to influence the game. This is the first time I've played Battlefield and felt like I can just relax. It also creates moments like no other Battlefields before it - you'll have parts of the Battlefield with 64 players just rushing the objective like Normandie.

- The Portal: People love it, I don't know why, but there's a Bad Company 2, a 1942 mode, and a Battlefield 3 mode. I tried it, it's fine. The community is pretty dead right now and seem to flock to AI matches.

- This ties into the open weapons but there are SO MANY weapons, vehicles, attachments and upgrades. It goes beyond the rest of the franchise. Being able to adjust them in match is a nice touch, though stupid and pretty divisive. Ghost Recon did it and it wasn't great,",True,0,3012

It looks and feels like a AAA title, with a few hiccups here and there, but nothing that ruins the experience.
It’s been fun watching the franchise finally take off like this. I really hope EA has learned their lesson and continues to give players what they want. So far, it seems like they’re heading in the right direction.

Bought it for $3. Worth about $2.50.

Maps are endless parking lots where cover doesn’t exist, and every corner is part of a sniper’s early retirement plan. Pretty sure the layouts were designed by a 60-year-old grandma at EA who thinks “fun” is drawing squares in Microsoft Paint.

Cross-play is mandatory, which just means being farmed by 30 twelve-year-olds with aimbot while you wonder why you didn’t just boot up Minesweeper instead.

And the theme? 2042 apparently means cargo ships rotting in deserts. The entire game looks like it was designed by a confused intern who watched Mad Max once and thought, “Yeah, but what if there were more boats?”

Somewhat fun for $3, but if you paid full price, seek therapy and financial restitution.

On another note, this is less battlefield, more hero shooter with vehicles. Huge dissonance between the specialist (operator, whatever you want to call them) quips and skins and the vibe that the natural disasters, the intro movie and the phenomenal soundtrack try to convey. Silly shooter stuff doesn't work well with a heavily experimental industrial soundtrack and the maps which show how devastatingly these climate disasters ravaged through them.

A temática realmente não caiu na graça dos jogadores. E eu concordo que realmente algumas dessas ""coisas"" futuristas não tem agradado muito, mas não deixa de ser um BF. A optimização do jogo parece que melhorou depois do lançamento. TTK está OK, nem rápido, nem lento. Alguns veículos são meio estranhos, algumas armas também. Tem torreta, cachorro robô, etc... mas no geral a trocação de tiro é satisfatória. Se o jogo tiver na promoção com mais de 90% de desconto só vai! Sem medo!!!

Maps are awfully designed, being way too big, almost entirely empty of cover anywhere but the points, and with each area of action so far apart from each other you end up spending half the game just running around looking for people. 
Everybody dies in a quarter second so you can mow through people brainlessly without any interesting challenge, then die out of nowhere with little to no time to react, then hope you have somebody to spawn on near the action or you have to spend multiple minutes running back. 
Every gun I tried felt like they fired the same and had the same recoil pattern, giving them no personality and making the gun play uninteresting.
The lighting is terrible, colors are muddy and shapes blend together even at max settings so you can barely tell things apart.

Battlefield 2042,1517290,202803277,"Another case study in wishing there was a ""Mixed Review"" on Steam. I purchased this game for $3.

BF2042, now at the end of life, is a decent game. It's a step down from BF1 and BF5, and will likely lose many players forever to the upcoming BF6, but at its core, it's an above average combined arms based FPS. 

However, it's a bad Battlefield game. The specialist system doesn't work, even at the end of life will all tweaks. Some are hilariously OP still, and some seem completely worthless. The gunplay works, but the maps still feel empty and lifeless. The last of specialists, only totaling a dozen, also speaks to the short support cycled for development, and how unfinished it is.

Ultimately, for under $5, you'll get your money's worth. 50ish hours is likely all I'll spend with it, but those fifty won't be greuling, aggonized suffering. Instead, after about 50 hours, I think I will have seen all the game has to offer. Get it at cheap, or not at all.",False,1,3294

The bar is set so high because the developers capitulated to the Call of Duty Community, and it's almost like someone has made it their duty to punish the rest of us to not enjoy this product. It is far too evident that this game has too many issues before the game can even be launched and I refuse to believe with a wealth of knowledge at all of our fingertips that this could not have been fixed.

Battlefield 6 beta run smoother than this, which is why I believe that somebody within the Battlefield Community is stopping others from enjoying this game",False,0,74

Battlefield 2042,1517290,202801055,"[h1]TL;DR: If you really want the BF6 skin, maybe get this game for 3 bucks. Otherwise, don’t buy it.[/h1]

I only played this game because it give a cool skin for Battlefield 6. Now I realize it’s really not worth my time. It doesn’t even have destructibility like the other Battlefield games what a shame.

The UI, characters, and even the voice acting feel weird. Honestly, this is the worst Battlefield so far.

If you just want the BF6 skin, maybe it’s worth 3 dollars, but 60? You’d have to be crazy to pay that. Either way, this game will be dead once Battlefield 6 releases. And the Portal servers? Easily the worst part you can’t even play properly on them.",False,3,2811
