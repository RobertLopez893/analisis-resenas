Overwatch 2,2357570,210432581,"After many hundreds of hours in OW1, I quit a short while after OW2 launched, after seeing the insane monetization decisions they made back then. You had to grind like crazy to get a skin, which is fine I guess, it's a skin, just cosmetic, but what bothered me even more was that you actually had to grind to unlock new heroes too, which was a wild decision, since you didn't have all heroes unlocked going into competitive, which ruined the balance completely. 

Anyway, Blizzard surprisingly learned from its mistakes and made a ton of positive changes to everything in the game, after checking it out again this year for the first time since 2022, it really feels like a great and fun game again, and the perk system keeps the competitive mode very fresh.

Overwatch 2,2357570,210402764,"Overwatch 2 é um jogo multiplayer que depende totalmente de trabalho em equipe. Os personagens são extremamente carismáticos, a lore é interessante, os gráficos são lindos e os mapas muito bem feitos. O novo modo Stadium deu uma vida nova ao jogo, deixando ele com uma vibe de MOBA competitivo que ficou realmente divertida. Ainda assim, falta aquela sensação de recompensa e todos os personagens estão sendo adicionados aos poucos no modo novo, ajudando no equilíbrio.

Mas, claro, nem tudo é perfeito — ou quase. Com o lançamento de Overwatch 2, o jogo ficou extremamente ganancioso com skins. A graça de colecionar tudo de graça nas lootboxes em Overwatch 1 simplesmente sumiu, substituída por moedas douradas que quase não aparecem pra quem joga sem gastar dinheiro. Isso desanima demais, porque antes era tudo mais acessível e recompensador.

Mesmo assim, eu amo Overwatch. Enjoei lá em 2020, parei, mas voltei em 2025 e já tô viciado de novo. O jogo ainda tem algo que prende, apesar dos tropeços.",True,0,698

Overwatch 2,2357570,210246021,"Hi, someone whose been playing Overwatch since it first came out... Oh boy has it been a ride and nor a good one. My hubby and I originally paid for Overwatch when it first came out. Let's just say I'm the only who plays it now and my hubby use to be diamond (which used to be top 500) when we played. We were pretty f*ing pissed when we heard Overwatch 2 was going out and it was going to be free. Like okay sure, but you're gonna at least give us our money back right... Yeah nope... Never saw that money back... And they got rid of lootboxes...
Blizzard as a company is garbage. We already know this, don't give them your money. It's not worth it. The store is incredibly overpriced, it's ridiculous. Like an actual joke. Good and amazing skins are usually behind a paywall when it comes to any game but Blizzard is just frickin greedy. Sometimes the Battle Pass is worth it and as someone whose tried to play enough so I don't have the buy the battlepass, yeah no... You can buy the battle pass one season and save enough overwatch coins to buy it again but they just want you to pour more money to this game and its not worth. Competitive... To put it lightly is a f*kin sh*t show. It's actually terrible and most of the time your whole team is going to leave and it can be brutal. OW2 community is also garbage. They are incredibly toxic and ppl will literally tell you to off yourself in quickplay. Don't even get me started on how many times they have re-worked heroes. 

I would like to give this game a positive review amongst tons of bad and it's difficult. There aren't many redeeming qualities about this game. Sometimes I do come back to it, usually to play a new hero, then I remember how bad it is.
Some redeeming qualities are that they added lootboxes back but that's not enough to fix a community that is so heartbroken. They abandoned Overwatch lore and to make up for it they keep doing collabs that again are behind a huge paywall.

Overwatch 2,2357570,210048270,"Welcome to the democratic world of Overwatch, where the game director is a politician. He starts every blog post and update with ""We are listening to the players"".

Not gonna hold my breath waiting for the day he actually does some directing instead of mindlessly taking feedback from everyone and trying to be a people pleaser. Guy is literally 2 blog posts away from asking the public for ideas to make up for his lack of plans for this formerly great franchise.

The game is a hollow shell of its former glory since Jeff Kaplan left. Jeff left and took the whole world of Overwatch with him. What's left here is a skin shop disguised as a game, with newer characters literally built from the Sims 4 Create-A-Sim. And flavor text that tries to pass for lore. 

Game Director doesn't care about any of the characters. He only cares about pleasing the people, and sadly, all the people want are skins. Well done us, and well done sir game director for not having a backbone to do right by Overwatch. 

At the state the current world of Overwatch is, I wish I never knew Overwatch so I didn't have to grief for more than a whole ass year. Blizzard used to be a company that built stories and worlds. Now all they build are cosmetics to sell.

We traded the lore and the world of Overwatch for skins. We built a cinematic engine in game just so we can use it for skin trailers, we recycle PvE content into brain dead game modes that nobody plays. 

Balancing and design for the game is also completely stat driven, so if you love seeing balancing done based on the statboard that is the source of all toxicity, do join us. Used to be heroes were able to do more than just dmg and heals, but now most heroes particularly the DPS lineup has been homogenized to feed the statboard. 

All that aside, the core gameplay is good and mostly polished, as it has always been since OW1. So basically nothing changed but everything changed.

If you like skins, come play. We've got plenty at the best prices in the industry. 

""Overwatch was shutdown for a reason"" - (Vivian Chase, back when there was lore) Now we know why she said this.

""The Overwatch I joined was about raising the world up"" - (Also Vivian Chase, back when she wasn't just a mannequin for skins) Yeah this ain't the Overwatch I joined.

But relatively recently, after Marvel Rivals came out, I got a taste for hero shooters and hit Celestial in the second season. With each new season, MR started to appeal to me less and less, so I decided to give Overwatch a try for myself.

I jumped straight into competitive mode and didn't do great in calibration because I hadn't fully figured out the game yet.
It placed me in Bronze 1, but I didn't get discouraged and decided to keep grinding on tank/support.

But after a while, I started noticing a trend: I was getting only 9-10 points per win (in the very best case, maybe 11).
I could understand if I was playing poorly, but even in games where my K/D reached about 5, I still only got 10 points.

And just recently, I decided to do a little marathon session, playing a total of 19 games (12 wins, 6 losses, 1 draw), and my rank didn't budge at all.

Overwatch 2,2357570,209964089,"This game literally changed my life. Ever since this game came out, all I can do is play Overwatch 2 from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep.

Originally, I purchased this game to play with my friends, but after forcing them to play about five games in a row, they all decided they’d had enough for the day. My intense desire for Overwatch 2 wasn’t satisfied, so I moved on to playing against a full room of AI. After my tenth game against five hard AI, I was still not satisfied, but my urge had to wait as I passed out before I could start a new game.

When I woke up, I plugged it in and went straight back to playing Overwatch 2. I played one round with five hard AI, but my urge simply got worse. I figured I wasn’t getting my fill since it took too long between my turns. I decided to change it to one hard AI, but after about three games I started to get impatient — to the point that I was screaming at the top of my lungs, telling the AI to hurry up so I could play.

It was around this time that my mother came into my room, telling me I had woken her up and that she was taking my PC away so she could get some sleep. Rage filled my body and, without even thinking, I punched her directly in the face and started screaming again as her body dropped to the ground.

I took her body, tied it to the bed, and gagged her so that when she woke up she wouldn’t be able to open her stupid mouth and tell me to stop playing the most amazing game known as Overwatch 2 for the PC.

When I finally got back to my game, my urge was so intense that I decided to start up a local multiplayer game with two players so I would always be playing. After about five games with myself, I started to calm down and realized that life would be okay — because I had Overwatch 2, and I never had to stop playing.

In the middle of the sixth game, my mom woke up and I started to hear her muffled screams. I told her she’d better shut up or I’d never let her go. After that, she quieted down — but little did she know, I would never let her go. I couldn’t risk letting her, or anyone for that matter, stop me from playing my game.

It’s now been ten days and I haven’t stopped playing since that morning. I’ve lost track of how many games I’ve played. I haven’t left my house, and my friends seem to be worried about me because they’ve called my phone multiple times in the past hour. But I don’t have time to talk to people who don’t love Overwatch 2 the way I do.

My mother stopped moving two days ago and is starting to smell — but I don’t care, because I have everything I need: Overwatch 2.",True,1,11480

Overwatch 2,2357570,209827165,"Reading all the new negative reviews irked the shit out of me, so I might as well answer the common complaints. It says 4.1 hrs on steam, but I got like nearly 1k hrs on battle.net. TOPIC: the game is over hated for outdated reasons (alt title: people like to bandwagon cuz they cant form actual and insightful reviews)

Its previous CEO had a negative impact on the game, especially right before his resignation. So the negative reviews on Steam release were extremely valid as the game were at its all-time low (and the fresh taste of PvE cancellation, even tho none of yall complaining about it will ever actually play it past 30 min). The release of Marvel Rivals was an important competition for Blizzard to improve and be bold. The current dev team are trying to shake off the bad rep the game used to hold.

Now it's very over hated as it is in a much better state with obvious growing numbers (Stadium gamemode catering to more players, reworks and nice visual updates). And to say that the ""2"" was only meant for 'heavy micro transactions', how tf are they suppose to make money on a free game as a big studio? Sure it was egregiously bad earlier but now there are more discounts and free lootboxes (just ignore the money signs). Sure they said PvE was intended, but things fell flat and reusing story mode concepts into the PvP modes (like in arcade at the moment) to then officially adding perks is a great move. They now have lore info tab so read/watch those too with more coming!

also... YOU HAVE TO PLAY MORE TO PROGRESS MORE. It has more of a meaningful progression, especially for new players (and will continue to be). You'd be surprise with how much you can get rare shop/collabs or previous battlepass items for free just for playing. No need to worry about FOMO.

Hero balancing is understandably frustrating. With 45 heroes, and counting, being added there are bound for someone to counter someone. And with how they are adjusted constantly shifting the meta, at least it's not the same meta every day yk? Every hero is up for potential on the chopping block, or for a promotion, it gets you going. Definitely better now since release.

The matchmaking is all you expect out of an online team-based hero shooter. The ones complaining are the same ones that goes back to rivals with a much worse matchmaking. It isn't perfect. Sometimes you are good in one game, then you become the worse player on your team in the next. It happens. Mostly fueled by egotistical people with their life on the line into winning their games. It's gonna be a wider elo in unrank than on ranked (yes, unrank has a hidden skill rating so it caters roughly to your skill level). Think about who you are playing WITH. Anyone higher or lower than your skill rating is gonna have an effect in your matches, eventually favoring the higher skill = more harder games.

You can make hilarious and creative metaphors to negatively describe each aspect of the game, but it isn't accurate to how it's portrayed, at least in the present times rn. If you care about having a good team with comms, I would suggest discord servers or anything else adjacent (for ANY gamemode, mic or no mic). If you hate the 5v5 format, play 6v6. If you hate your mmr, strive to be better? seek a coach or watch videos and stop being ignorant. 

Not to cocksuck blizzard to say this game is peak and is without flaws. What I am saying tho is that this game is in a much MUCH better state and is OVERHATED 2 lol. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",True,1,245

Overwatch 2,2357570,209825742,"Honest long review by me.

I’ve been playing Overwatch since December 2016. Back then, the game actually meant something. Matches took skill, teamwork, and timing. Pulling off a clutch felt earned. Heroes had identity, fights had weight, and every win was yours. Fast forward to 2025 and I barely recognize what I’m playing. The soul is gone. It’s a hollow, frustrating shell of what once was one of the best games ever made.

Matchmaking has been trash for YEARS. I don’t know if it’s EOMM, SBMM, hidden throttling, or just pure incompetence, but matches feel predetermined. One game you stomp, the next you get thrown into a blender. It never feels like you win because you played well — it feels like the system decided the outcome the moment you queued. It’s exhausting, and it’s been this way since I first touched the game.

Season 9 was the point where Blizzard completely killed skill expression. Every patch since then is built around flattening the game and making precision irrelevant. Tanks are raid bosses, supports are basically DPS with insane sustain, and DPS is just… cosmetic. You can land every shot and it still doesn’t matter because the sustain loop is busted. They call it “accessibility,” but it’s really the death of competitive integrity. Years of learning mechanics, tracking, positioning — all of that means nothing now.

The devs keep insisting 5v5 is “better,” but all it did was destroy the role ecosystem. Tanks feel awful unless they’re overtuned, supports only shine by turning into mini-tanks, and DPS is irrelevant unless something is accidentally broken. Every balance patch feels like it was designed by developers who’ve never played above Bronze. Instead of fixing meaningful issues, they buff easy heroes, nerf depth, and pretend they’re saving the game.

Then we have the company behind all this. Blizzard isn’t Blizzard anymore. The harassment scandals, the studio culture issues, the PR nonsense — everything behind the scenes mirrors the state of the game. Hollow, directionless, and full of ego. They talk about “trusting the vision,” but the vision is a dumpster fire.

And the hero identity? Completely gone. They’ve abandoned edgy, skill-heavy heroes like Hanzo, Sombra, and Reaper. Permanent underdogs now. In their place, we get shiny, safe, streamer-friendly characters. And speaking of new characters — Vendetta is literally a knock-off Magik from Marvel Rivals. Same look, same vibe, same glowing magic-sword aesthetic. It’s embarrassing. They really thought their copy could compete with the actual Queen of Limbo? Be serious.

To make it even funnier, Blizzard emailed me saying I “qualified for a free Premium Battle Pass due to login issues.” I never had any. They’re just handing out passes like apology coupons now. What a joke.

The community is another disaster. Somehow people think Overwatch 2 is at its “peak.” They cheer for pointless modes like Stadium — something nobody asked for — while the actual competitive experience is falling apart. It’s Fortnite with ultimates now. Casual hype drowns out any real feedback, and anyone who points out the game’s decline gets treated like the problem.

I’ve actually had to force myself to play other games just to feel skill matter again. Need for Speed — a racing game — gives me more satisfaction because your mistakes are yours. Meanwhile, Overwatch feels rigged or random. Wins and losses feel like matchmaking dice rolls, not performance.

Custom games used to be a place to escape the chaos. Now they’re ruined too. Fake-friendly lobbies full of creeps, drama, harassment, and weirdos. Blizzard does absolutely nothing. They never have. Moderation is cosmetic — just like half the game mechanics now.

Then there’s the monetization. Every new season is “BUY MORE KIRIKO SKINS,” “Check out the new bundle,” “Look at the new crossover event.” Everything feels like a commercial. Even hero buffs feel like marketing pushes. The game’s direction is driven by engagement metrics, not gameplay health. They don’t balance for fun or fairness — they balance for attention spans.

It’s been a slow, painful decline. I kept hoping the game would recover, that Blizzard would fix matchmaking, revive skill-based play, bring back hero identity. But every patch proves they’re going the opposite direction. The game gets more chaotic, more casual-focused, more empty.

Overwatch now feels like watching a corpse move. The animations are pretty, the maps are nice, the heroes look cool — but the soul is missing. There’s no tension, no clutch value, no sense that your input matters. Winning rarely feels earned. Losing feels predetermined. Everything that made it special has been replaced by noise, spam, sustain, and monetization.

The casual community celebrates meaningless skins and overhyped updates while ignoring the actual problems. They cheer for fluff while the core rots. It’s painful to watch a game you loved slowly sink while people clap at the fireworks on the deck.

I’ve held on for too long. I kept telling myself it could get better. But it hasn’t. Every patch reminds me:
the devs don’t care about skill, don’t care about veterans, and don’t care about the identity this game once had.

Overwatch used to be a masterpiece.
Now it’s a flashy, hollow shell propped up by marketing, casual hype, and nostalgia.

""Overwatch is a team vs team, 6v6 competitive experience. And there's NO WAY we're losing that at all!""
-Jeff Kaplan, 2019

No wonder why Papa Jeff left the company...
His vision of Overwatch 2 has been completely destroyed.

This is not Overwatch 2. This is just Overwatch 1 but intentionally designed to be inexplicably worse. It's ludicrous!

The main reason this game was called Overwatch 2, was the announced and overly advertised PvE missions, with the new hero skill trees, customizable abilities and hero progression, and then after over 3 YEARS of waiting, basically everything PvE related that was announced in this trailer was cancelled*.

On top of that, as an excuse for ""working"" for all the cancelled stuff, they left in the dust the original game with 3 years of no content at all, because ""they were focusing on making the sequel"".
So, what they added in the ""new"" game after these 3 years of no content?
A Battle Pass instead of Loot Boxes
The worst scummy monetization system I've ever seen. Literally everything has to be paid now, including 7+ year old skins that cost 19 euros each.
5v5 instead of 6v6 (which means a hero balance way more broken than before)
Only 3 new heroes (a rate of 1 hero per year)
6 new maps (but they also REMOVED 5 maps)
THAT'S IT! What was the point of the ""2"" in the title then?
Is literally the same game as 2016, but with even less stuff than before.
Player levels? Gone
Medals? Gone
End game cards? Gone
""Looking for Group"" feature? Gone
On-fire system? Gone initially, and re-added later as a ""new content"" (L.M.F.A.O.)
2CP mode? They had no idea of how to balance it, so they just removed it from the core game entirely.
As this wasn't enough, who bought the original game in 2016 and spent thousands of hours like me, has no choice but stop playing entirely or being stuck playing this hell of a mess with extremely predatory monetization, because they SHUT DOWN the original game despite saying that OW1 and OW2 were going to be playable together**, so there's no way back.

Overwatch 2,2357570,209676571,"Overwatch 2 is what happens when a good game gets kidnapped, held hostage, and forced to work in the cosmetics department. Blizzard didn’t make a sequel - they made a mobile cash shop wearing an FPS costume. They shut down OW1, replaced it with less content, slapped price tags on everything, and acted like they did us a favor.

Every “update” feels like Blizzard sprinting to the bank with a suitcase full of legendary skins. Real gameplay changes? Slow. New modes with actual effort? Rare. PvE campaign they hyped for YEARS? Scrapped—because apparently selling recolors is more “cost effective.” I guess story mode development got outbid by another Kiriko or Mercy Skin.

The shop gets more updates than the GAME. How is that normal? Hero balance can sit broken for months, but the second they can charge $29.99 for an angel with wings or a robot in a hoodie, they’ll push it out like they’re saving lives. Blizzard didn’t upgrade Overwatch - they downgraded it and monetized the downgrade.

You know it’s bad when the main progression system is your credit card.

They removed loot boxes so they could charge you directly. They removed OW1 so they could lock heroes behind paywalls. They removed PvE so they could sell skin packs. They basically removed everything except the one thing players don’t actually play for: the SHOP.

Overwatch 2 is literally a fashion simulator with occasional shooting breaks.

If you enjoy overpriced outfits more than actual new content, go wild. But if you’re here for a real sequel, do yourself a favor and don’t bother. Blizzard’s main game mode isn’t Competitive or Quickplay - it’s Cash Grab: Legendary Edition.",False,2,64396

But everything wrapped around that core seems determined to smother it. Matchmaking feels like emotional roulette, queue times bounce all over the place, and progression rewards hit with all the excitement of an empty cereal box prize. Then there’s the “sequel” label — which feels more like a marketing stunt than an honest evolution. Blizzard took a game that was already slowing down and somehow morphed it into a slapped-together, cash-draining carousel of recycled content and inexplicable design choices. That big “2” might as well stand for “2 more battle passes, 2 fewer reasons to log in, and 2 functioning brain cells left after waiting 30 minutes just to play support.” The supposedly revolutionary PvE mode — hyped for years — disappeared faster than your tank in a doomed 1v5. Meanwhile, balance updates swing so violently they might as well be written by a committee of coin flips. One patch turns Cassidy into an unstoppable force; the next makes him about as effective as interior decoration. And matchmaking? Blizzard could swap the algorithm with a blindfold and a dartboard, and I’m not convinced we’d notice a difference.

Overwatch 2,2357570,209512508,"NOTE: I played significantly on battle net before I started playing on steam. check my achievement to get a feel for just how much time i've put into it.

within the last few months, it's felt like the OW devs have started getting their act together. despite the whole history of betrayal and disappointments, the game in its current state is simply good. proper competition for Marvel Rivals. the ""Mostly Negative"" reviews are primarily a hold-over from that nearly decade long history of BS after BS.

OW2 no longer carries that ""Steve Jobs with the iPhone"" spark that it felt like it had back in 2016, and yes you can feel that it's gone. you have a basic battle pass but compared to other games, even compared to marvel rivals, the battle pass in OW is very well implemented and reasonably player-friendly. some mild sadge moments when you discover a great skin was season locked but ultimately their monetization is not bad, especially when you compare it to other games. 

The gameplay is still as good as you probably remember it, there will always be some heroes over-tuned slightly but again, it's not anything new if you've played other kinds of games. 5v5 is a bit simpler, feels like team-based sumo wrestling where you're just smashing your team against theirs. 6v6 is chaotic enough with enough stuff going on that you rely on teamwork way more no matter what role you play, and it is very noticeable. both modes are available and accessible, and in the 80 hours i've played at the time of release, the devs have already put out 2 separate unique event modes with wacky rules and fun experiments. the custom games browser is also a great source of fun and trying how new things.

TL;DR Overwatch 2 is currently a worthy competitor to Marvel Rivals. the monetization is not bad compared to the rest of the industry, just less generous than OW1's ""here's everything all the time for free"" model. the balance is decent, again not any worse than other games. plenty of fun to be had here, it is definitely worth the $0.00 it takes to start playing.",True,2,4809

Overwatch 2,2357570,209508943,"btw all my hours are opn the battle.net

For everyone reading this review, I've played this game since Overwatch one. The very start of it by the way, and I've also played it competitively. I've earned my right to judge this game. I have over by far 1000 hours on console and over 600 on pc prob more like 800 
 
This game is horrid. Overwatch 1 was great. I am a very major Overwatch 1 fan and will always hope Overwatch one originally comes back. When they took out 6v6 I was very disappointed. 5V5 is terrible. You play tank, you get counter picked half the time you play DPS and if you don't do good enough your team falls apart and you get blamed. Healers if they do not heal enough you get blamed. And then you lose the game. It's a terrible game ever when Nick picks you for the littlest thing. They promised us a campaign, we paid for the campaign for full access and it gets taken away. We don't even get a refund for any of the money that we spent on the past to get the campaign The only thing that we keep are the maps and it was absolutely terrible. 

The battle pass is terrible and I will always stand by that. I've bought it a few times and I personally think it's a waste of money  They took out loot crates to replace it with a battle pass, which I still think is a terrible idea. Everyone was very mad that their loot crates all got opened and they were saving for a massive Loot Crate open for anything like that. 

 

Don't even get me started on the skins. All the OG skins back in the day for Overwatch 1 you can buy them for now for like 30 bucks. For the most recent ash skin for the pool party they just reskin the old one lmao It's absolutely horrendous you can spend $60.00 on 4 skins maybe even 5  

 

For my conclusion of this, I still think this game is just a money grab for Blizzard to milk as much money as they can The game was good, they thought it was going to be coming back when they brought in Overwatch 2, but it was absolutely terrible. The game is dying and will never be the same as it was. Personally I think they can't fix it. They can keep trying to add heroes and make it better and this and that, but it's not going to be better. All the characters that they release are going to always be broken on release date and then terrible afterwards. Same thing happened with Venture The game is dying. That's it.

The launch of Overwatch 2 absolutely obliterated any trust between the developers and the players. And they've really never earned that trust back.

annow in season 19, idk why the fuck they did this, but u have to play around 20 qp matches before u can queue for comp. because of that, a bunch of newbies end up in my games n it completely ruins the whole experience. season 17 was when overwatch was actually gud — it made me actually want to play with hero bans n then map voting coming on the way. but now the game is garbage. not to mention the trash change they made that led to what i believe is rank inflation. i dont remember exactly what they did, but i think they made it so masters rank is now the top 6% instead of the top 1%. i specifically remember these devs making the champion rank because high gm n low gm players had very different skill ratings, so changing it like this just doesn’t make sense to me. this change, as well as change from 50 to 20 qp games before comp, made matchmaking hell.

You can tailor your own playstyle with perks which have made many characters dramatically more fun to play. Hero bans and map voting were overdue, but incredibly welcome features.

The game now has 3 main modes to play, Stadium, 5v5 role lock and 6v6 openQ, which means there's something for everyone. (I am no longer forced to play against supertanks in 5v5!)

Really my main gripe with the game is that sometimes the balancing can feel a bit...off with seemingly random chances to random heroes. However, you can pretty easily ban the power outliers (if they exist). 

Regarding cosmetics, I don't really care about them personally, but they are still undoubtedly too expensive for what they are.

Overwatch 2,2357570,209325304,"Overwatch 2 offers everything fans loved about the first game, with a new twist: a shift to 5v5, revamped maps, new heroes, and more aggressive pace. But while the gameplay can be incredibly fun when the matches are balanced, the experience can feel frustrating and uneven when the matchmaking system doesn’t deliver.

Let’s start with the positives—Overwatch 2 is a blast when everything clicks. The hero-based combat is still exhilarating, with tight controls, engaging team dynamics, and a range of strategies that keep the game feeling fresh. The new additions, like Sojourn and the revamped maps, help reinvigorate the experience. If the match is well-balanced, with teams of equal skill and coordination, it’s easy to lose yourself in the flow of the game, whether you’re coordinating team ultimates, landing a clutch headshot as Hanzo, or pushing the payload with your team as you work together to secure the win.

However, that’s where the problem lies: the matchmaking system. Despite Blizzard’s efforts to improve the process, Overwatch 2 still struggles with creating balanced teams, especially in higher ranks. The ""competitive"" mode feels more like a roulette wheel of who gets paired with the better teammates, with games often feeling like one-sided blowouts rather than tightly contested battles. Matchmaking doesn’t always account for things like team composition, individual skill disparities, or even the all-important synergy between teammates.

In practice, this means you can go from an absolutely thrilling match to an infuriating one where the game feels like it’s over before it even began. In many cases, you’ll find yourself on a team where players aren’t working together, or worse, you're stuck with people who are far below your skill level (or way above it) while the enemy team seems to have everything together. The inconsistent matchmaking really pulls you out of the experience, and it’s frustrating to feel like your victory or defeat is more about the luck of the draw than your actual performance.

Overall, Overwatch 2 shines in its core gameplay when the match is balanced, offering the same chaotic, satisfying, and team-oriented action that fans adore. But until the matchmaking gets tweaked and refined, it can be a bit of a rollercoaster ride, and not always in the fun way. It’s a game that can be incredibly rewarding, but also one that often leaves you wondering, “Couldn’t we just get one match where both teams feel equally matched?”",False,1,7892
Overwatch 2,2357570,209325042,"its fun
",True,1,4176
Overwatch 2,2357570,209324682,"The matchmaking sucks.
Over the last 6 months, atleast, I didn't have a single match that felt remotely balanced.
Either our Team got a completely new player (bonus points if on tank) or it was reversed.
Usually resulting in sweeps and stomps with absolutely no fun to be had by anyone involved.

I don't know if it's something wrong with my account but this issue has been persistent.

I've been playing since OW1 Release and I've never had this much and this consistent problems with the matchmaker.
Maybe the blame is on me for playing Quickplay but it can't realistically be this difficult to find a balanced match.

For reference I usually am playing with an friend who is roughly the same rank as I in Role Queue.
I also have roughly 680 hours clocked in the different gamemode, with most of them in QP followed by Comp. So it's not like this is coming from an lack of playing or calibration.

If I end up loosing 80% of my matches because the teams are incredibly imbalanced and the other 20% are equally unbalanced, just so happens to be in my favor, something is seriously messed up.

And if I am just ""Too Trash"" for the MMR I have I would've demoted into an ""more appropriate"" MMR after 6 Months of trying and playing.

I've been giving the game the chances it deserved, at first I thought they just made some changes to the matchmaker that will be fixed eventually. However multiple seasons have passed and nothing has changed, nothing has improved.

Yes we got cool new features, and perks, and whatnot, but if I can't enjoy a game because it's horrible imabalanced then what even is the point?

If Blizzard just wants us to play Comp then why even have QP in the first place if it's matchmaker is this horribly mismanaged.

It hurts especially since I've been RECOMMENDING the game to my friends over the last year, with the changes that happened it finally felt like a ""new"" game after all those years of stagnation and lack of care from our overlords Blizzard. But now we're here where I'm adding to the overall negative reviews for this game.


This is just my personal experience, well, mine and that of my friend.
However if you want to give it a shot don't be perusaded by my personal frustration.
Maybe this Matchmaking issue is just affecting me and my friend, maybe it's just a local issue and you'll have a great time.

But from my experience I can no longer, and won't anymore stand up to the bullshit that is this matchmaking.",False,2,4828

Overwatch 2,2357570,209123018,"Why You Should Not Play Overwatch 2: A Critical Examination
The world of video games is constantly evolving, with new titles promising fresh experiences and improved gameplay. However, not every sequel lives up to its potential, and in some cases, it even detracts from the legacy of its predecessor. Overwatch 2 is, unfortunately, a prime example of this phenomenon. Once hailed as a promising evolution of Blizzard’s beloved team-based shooter, Overwatch 2 has instead become a cautionary tale in the gaming industry—a game riddled with design missteps, corporate greed, and community disappointment. This essay explores the many reasons why Overwatch 2 is a horrible game and why gamers should think twice before investing their time, money, and hope in it.

1. The Illusion of Innovation
When Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, fans expected a meaningful sequel with significant improvements and new content. Instead, what they received was an incremental update masquerading as a new game. The much-touted shift from 6v6 to 5v5 gameplay did little to fundamentally alter the core experience. Maps, heroes, and game modes were slightly tweaked, but the changes felt superficial at best. Many players noted that Overwatch 2 played almost identically to the original, with only a handful of new heroes and maps that could have easily been introduced as updates to the first game.

Perhaps the most egregious example of this lack of innovation is the handling of the promised PvE (Player vs. Environment) mode. This feature was heavily marketed as the cornerstone of Overwatch 2, setting it apart from its predecessor and justifying its existence as a sequel. However, Blizzard eventually scrapped the ambitious PvE campaign, leaving players with a glorified patch rather than a true sequel. This broken promise eroded trust and demonstrated a fundamental disregard for the community’s expectations.

2. Monetization and Corporate Greed
If there is one aspect where Overwatch 2 stands out, it is in its aggressive monetization strategies. The original Overwatch adopted a “buy once, play forever” model, with cosmetic items available through loot boxes that could be earned through gameplay. While loot boxes are controversial, they at least allowed dedicated players to unlock content without spending additional money.

Overwatch 2, on the other hand, is free-to-play—but at a significant cost. The introduction of battle passes, expensive cosmetics, and paywalls for new heroes has transformed the game into a cash grab. Players now have to pay real money or grind for dozens of hours to access new content, and the prices for skins and bundles are exorbitant. This shift in philosophy prioritizes profits over player enjoyment, creating an environment where those who pay are often rewarded more than those who play.

Moreover, the decision to lock new heroes behind the battle pass undermines the competitive integrity of the game. In a title where team composition and hero selection are crucial, forcing players to unlock heroes through progression or payment creates an uneven playing field. This pay-to-win perception has alienated both new and returning players, further damaging the game’s reputation.

3. Disregard for the Community
A successful multiplayer game thrives on its community, but Blizzard’s handling of Overwatch 2 demonstrates a striking lack of respect for its player base. Communication has been inconsistent, with frequent delays and vague updates about the game’s direction. The scrapping of the PvE mode, as previously mentioned, was not only a broken promise but also a blatant disregard for the excitement and anticipation of long-time fans.

Additionally, the forced migration from Overwatch to Overwatch 2, which included the shutdown of the original game’s servers, left many players feeling betrayed. Those who preferred the original’s mechanics, balance, or business model were given no choice but to adapt or quit. This move eliminated player agency and erased years of gaming history, all for the sake of pushing a lackluster sequel.

Toxicity and cheating have also become more prevalent in Overwatch 2. Despite promises of better moderation and anti-cheat systems, many players report that these issues are worse than ever. The lack of meaningful community tools, such as robust reporting and matchmaking improvements, has only exacerbated these problems.

4. Gameplay and Balance Issues
On a fundamental level, Overwatch 2 suffers from numerous gameplay and balance issues. The shift to 5v5 has not been universally well-received. Many players feel that the loss of a second tank has made matches more chaotic, less strategic, and more punishing for solo players. The meta is often dominated by a handful of overpowered heroes, while others languish in obscurity due to poor balancing.

Frequent balance patches and hero reworks have not resolved these problems; in some cases, they have made things worse by introducing new bugs or unintended consequences. The game now feels less like a carefully crafted competitive experience and more like an experimental testbed, where players are subjected to constant changes and disruptions. This instability is frustrating for both casual and competitive players, who crave consistency and fairness.

5. Technical and Quality-of-Life Failures
Beyond its design flaws, Overwatch 2 is plagued by technical issues and a lack of quality-of-life improvements. Server problems, long queue times, and frequent disconnections are common complaints. Despite being marketed as a next-generation upgrade, the game still suffers from outdated graphics, clunky user interfaces, and limited accessibility options.

Basic features that are standard in other competitive games—such as robust stat tracking, replay systems, and customizable controls—are either missing or poorly implemented. These oversights further contribute to the sense that Overwatch 2 is a rushed and incomplete product.

6. The Decline of Blizzard’s Reputation
Blizzard was once a name synonymous with quality and innovation. The company’s decline has been well-documented, from controversies over workplace culture to questionable business decisions. Overwatch 2 represents the culmination of this downward spiral—a game designed more by committee and corporate mandate than by passion and creativity.

By supporting Overwatch 2, players are not only endorsing a mediocre game but also enabling the practices that have led to Blizzard’s fall from grace. There are countless other games, both old and new, that deserve your time and money more than this disappointing sequel.

Conclusion: Choose Better
In summary, Overwatch 2 is a deeply flawed game that fails to justify its existence as a sequel. It offers little innovation, prioritizes monetization over enjoyment, disrespects its community, and suffers from numerous gameplay and technical issues. The forced migration from Overwatch to its inferior successor is a stark reminder of how far Blizzard has strayed from its roots.

If you value your time, your money, and your love for gaming, do not play Overwatch 2. There are far better alternatives that respect their players, foster positive communities, and deliver genuinely innovative experiences. Let Overwatch 2 serve as a warning: demand more from the games you play, and never settle for less.",False,3,13

Overwatch 2,2357570,208973328,"The bad
To start off, I started Overwatch at the start of 2017, I've seen it both rise and fall to say the least. For the longest while in 2020-2023 the game was so bad I would rather play any other game in existence. I would even go to play Placid Plastic Duck Simulator competitively. No updates, no new content, and a failed promises of a PvE campaign that was canceled a full year before OW2. Most heroes were reworked so differently in that span of time that it felt like a heap of trash trying to fight another heap of trash every game. I really don't need to shed light on the old developer team. Everybody knows the damage they did.

The good
I am glad to say that progress is being made. The reworks have balanced the roster better than before. The graphics engine has been overhauled and optimized decently. (I played with a GTX 980 TI and just upgraded a week before this review) The balancing actually helped make the game fun again. But, some heroes are specialized for specific things, specifically Roadhog being a maximum survivability tank now. 

Just though I should add this, Matchmaking has been updated recently. Skill based matches are in both ranked and quickplay now. It feels way better not having impossible to win matches around every corner. I mean, you lose the steamroll games where you crush the other team, but its a fair trade.

Now that Marvel Rivals has came out Overwatch has some actual competition and pressure towards community feedback. But I highly doubt that it can come back from the reputation damage from the old OW developer team and the ongoing greed from Blizzard. Right now it is actually really fun, most of the toxic players jumped ship to Rivals. Overwatch is in a good shape overall for me to recommend to either returning players or new players.",True,0,7005

I rarely chat in game or never use in game voice chat(I have social anxiety btw, only use discord with my lil brother), never use cheats, I played the game the way in meant to be played(I usually play support most of the time) and never throw. They don't even give you a warning or suspension, just straight up banning you. Now I feel like the money I spent in the game, especially this season, got wasted and my little brother is upset by this too, since we play this game together most of the time together. He told me that it was unfair that I got ban, and that it should be him because he chats more often in game and sometimes argue with someone. He also stop playing the game after that. And, this is the first time I got banned in a game too.

I appealed once and explain everything, after a couple of hours they just sent me another email saying a game master resolved the ticket or appeal. It didn't really mention if my account got unban or they rejected it. Well, it turns out they rejected it, because the ban is still there. I tried to appeal again and ask for proof or evidence day after day but never got a response until now.

Edited: I just received their response today and I got accused of using third party software and they didn't clarify what software(I only use discord with my little brother when playing.)
Yeah, I'm not getting my account back. They won't let me appeal anymore. This sucks, I quit Overwatch now. My money and time just got wasted for an unjustified ban.

Last Update: Surprisingly, I got my account back this morning which I'm really glad at and in relief. I received an email that says that my account closure has been an error.

Overwatch 2,2357570,208604976,"Alright, let's actually provide a constructive review. Why are people ""review bombing"" Overwatch 2?

We paid for Overwatch, we supported it throughout its lifespan, it was popular and liked by its community, and turning a happy profit each year.

When Blizzard announced Overwatch 2, the big new feature they announced, the entire premise that made it ""worth the sequel treatment"" was the PvE campaign mode. Hero talent trees, customizable abilities, an expansive co-op campaign that would add to the story and lore. We were told it was going to be so much work that they wouldn't be putting out updates for Overwatch any more, they were re-allocating the staff to work on this new project.

With no updates, and no content, Overwatch started to get stale... people grew tired and bored, spending less time in the game, or moving on. Many of us stuck with the product, playing a little each week just to keep fresh... waiting for the new campaign mode. For a lot of us, playing became a chore, something we were doing out of habit, so we'd be ready for the new campaign...

But the new campaign wasn't the premise that established OW2, it was the pretext. It was a lie. Blizzard abandoned the PvE campaign a full YEAR before OW2 launched - but continued to push it in marketing as the big new feature. It's even in the announcement trailer for OW2, and on the roadmaps. They knew they'd canned it 12 months earlier, but they knew that's what people wanted, so kept putting it front and centre to get people's money, to get people to buy into the project. They took our trust and monetized it.

-----

What does OW2 ACTUALLY offer then? What did they work on for those two years that was so important that they couldn't make content for OW1, the product people paid for and were supporting?

1) They overhauled the graphical engine:

Before, Overwatch would play on a relatively low spec computer, and it'd be smooth. Now, it stutters and stammers in the menus. They've added this weird shiny plastic finish to everything in the world, heroes and environment alike - so where before, heros would ""pop"" against the background and be easy to follow, now everything has the same texture to it, and it all merges together into visual noise - especially at longer ranges. They've compensated for how bad this looks by adding lots of additional flashy effects and explosions, that makes it much harder to see anything amidst the chaos. A PvP game at this pace relies heavily on quick disambiguation of what you're looking at, so you can react and compete, and the new engine makes this impossible without turning all the effects back off... meaning that the two years of development is for a feature best disabled.

The new engine also has a weird slippery ""feel"" to it. Reviewers who'd played Overwatch for 50 hours came into Overwatch 2 and reported ""look! it's the same Overwatch you love, but it's F2P now! Just ignore the monetization and you can play this great game for free!"" Established long term players with thousands of hours were on reddit complaining that their hitboxes were all over the place and shots that would previously ""feel"" like a dead certain hit were just completely whiffing, and they didn't understand why. All the timings are messed up.

2) They reworked most of the heroes:

TLDR: they screwed up the game balance. Previously, one of the biggest appeals of Overwatch was that you could find a hero that suited your play style, and main them, getting good at whatever suited you best. Some people like sniping, or hitscan run and gun, some people aren't good at reactionary aim and instead liked to focus on positioning, tactics and strategy. You could make a big positive different to your team by playing lucio or mercy, and paying attention to your surroundings, and positioning yourself in the right place at the right time to make the difference.

With Overwatch 2, the damage and healing behaviour has been reworked heavily. Now, the one tank on the team is insanely chunky, and it's near impossible to kill them quickly - with healer support, they can just stand in the line of fire and laugh. Everyone else dies almost immediately, regardless of who their aggressor is.

Team-fighting now is very one-note, you have one tank who's immortal if they have support, and you have four hitscan DPS characters following them - there's not a lot of difference between supports and DPS characters. The teams try to pick off the other team's DPS/Support characters, and when they pick a few off, they can finish the tank and take the objective. Repeat. There's no room for variation in play style at all, you either play a DPS and try to kill the other team DPS, or you play a tank, and try to position correctly - maybe picking off an enemy hero that gets too close to you.

I understand a lot of this came from feedback at the professional levels, where support players were complaining that they wanted to have more direct impact in teamfights, they wanted the game to feel more like other FPS games - but for a large portion of Overwatch's playerbase specifically, the appeal of the game was that you could do something else and still matter.

3. They got INCREDIBLY greedy with the monetization...

It's a longstanding argument that lootboxes are terrible in modern gaming... but Overwatch was one of the few examples of Lootboxes done right. Most of the long-term players of the game actually liked the system, that just rewarded you for playing the game and let you unlock whatever content you wanted relatively quickly. I started playing OW1 with the first anniversary, cleared the weekly boxes from arcade every week, and at the launch of OW2, I owned every single item in the game. Those who didn't have the time to invest in doing everything could still quickly unlock specific items they wanted (and let's be honest, when you have your favourite skin, how much do you care about unlocking other skins?) - and those who didn't want to spend hours unlocking stuff could spend a little cash to get it - if they wanted to.

The new system puts almost everything behind a paywall. The minute number of cosmetics on the ""free"" track are often insultingly lazy, simple recolours or minor alterations, while they put serious effort into skins that you can only buy for $20. The content you can unlock by grinding often feels like it only exists to drag you into interfaces that advertise the paid content for you. Even content from the first game, that was originally free, is now paid only.

Battlepass systems suck. ""Pay us for the opportunity to unlock stuff if you play a lot. If you don't you have to pay us more, or lose the stuff you already paid for."" - Limited time deals, rotating shop offers, FOMO FOMO FOMO... it reeks of manipulation and insincerity.

4. Occasional DLC packs of PvE adventures.

These are Blizzard's ""new"" approach to PvE. Occasional mission packs where you can get a little bit of story and a PvE mission. You can pay (in my UK currency) £13 for the DLC pack, or £35 (the cost of a good indie game"" for the ""ultimate bundle"".

So here's the thing - this content is the same amount of content, and the same pace of release as the old mission scenarios - it's just now, instead of them being a free event to get people excited about playing and encourage their friends to join up - now they're paid DLC.

Nobody likes paying a regular subscription for a product that they previously owned completely. It doesn't make anyone like Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office, and it doesn't make anyone like Blizzard.

-----

So this is why people are ""review bombing"" your game. You took something we paid for, supported and enjoyed for years, lied to us about your plans, and turned it into trash. Now you're telling us to pay for features and content we previously enjoyed in the game we paid for. It's greedy, it's cynical, it's manipulative, and you've lost our trust.

2. You get absolutely DEMOLISHED by the enemy team, primarily their Bastion who somehow has their ultimate every 20 seconds. 

You think to yourself ""Oh lets play this character i like this character"" NOPE. if you dont play the character you are unironically mediocre (your best character) at, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED. Trying to capture point? ""Nerf this!"" sigh. Get a full team kill solo in overtime and carry the game? The POTG goes to either Bastion or some stupid character who made one good play at the start of the game that didnt really do that much for the team. But mainly Bastion. You think ""Oh, maybe ill play Bastion this time, thatll work""  Of course not! Yes, you get 15k damage and somehow the POTG goes to Moira, but you get spam hated on in chat for playing that annoying character. You still lose, by the way.

Compared to the original early in its life this game lacks impact and punch in the combat. Now it feels way too watered down with way too much flashing and flooding the screen. Default controls are more often than not an inconsistent annoyance between heroes. 
For a game with such a supposedly high concurrent player count the wait times often take longer than a single or even multiple matches. Not to mention the coin-flip poor server connections once you do connect.

Overwatch 2,2357570,208186092,"I loaded into Overwatch 2: Stadium expecting a casual match.
The announcer yelled, the lights flared, and suddenly I was sweating like it was the finals of the Overwatch World Cup — except everyone on my team was role-playing as background NPCs.

My tank charged into the enemy team before the gates even opened.
Our Widowmaker was doing parkour on the stadium lights.
The Lucio spent the entire match DJ’ing instead of healing.

Meanwhile, I — a humble Cassidy main — was trying to hit shots while dodging D.Va bombs, Sigma rocks, and crippling performance anxiety from the digital crowd screaming in 7.1 surround sound.

At one point, the enemy Rein typed “EZ” in chat, so naturally our Genji wrote a 3-paragraph essay about team diff and “support responsibility.”
I haven’t seen that kind of passion since the actual World Cup.

I lost the match 0–3, but I did land one clean Deadeye in overtime and felt like Tom Brady with a revolver.

I'll throw in a recipe for Varenyky.

Recipe for Potato Dumplings (Varenyky)
Ingredients:
For the dough:
Wheat flour – 500 g
Water – 200 ml
Egg – 1
Salt – 1 tsp
For the filling:
Potatoes – 1 kg
Onions – 2
Lard or butter – 50 g
Salt – to taste
Ground black pepper – to taste
Preparation steps:
Making the dough:
Sifting the flour: Sift the flour into a large bowl.
Making the dough: Add salt and the egg to the flour. Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.
Resting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.
Preparing the filling:
Boiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.
Preparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.
Making the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.
Forming the dumplings:
Rolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.
Forming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.
Cooking the dumplings:
Boiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.
Cooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).
Serving:
Removing the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.
Serving: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.

Overwatch 2,2357570,208145694,"Jogo desde Overwatch 1 e desde que venderam a Blizzard e se tornou o Overwatch 2, o jogo e a Blizzard foram pra cucuia, é insalubre, desrespeitosa, rouba os clientes, trata os jogadores como lixo... mente, engana, forja conteúdo, lança coisas feias demais e cobram o preço de um jogo AAA por essas coisas (como pingente de arma que custa dinheiro de verdade e ainda é feio e inútil). Blizzard é a sombra do cocô pisado do que já foi um dia! Creio que não vá durar muito mais se continuar caminhando pelo vale das sombras que anda trilhando como futuro!! Vai virar uma Sega da vida! Nasceu como uma Indie e hoje se tornou uma vilã na própria história! 
Overwatch 1 custava R$ 70,00, era divertido, tinha problemas, mas era muito bom, rodava até em calculadora de energia solar! Mas quando prometeram o 2 ... tudo foi por água abaixo... problemas técnicos, conteúdo removido, mapas que sumiram, mapas novos que ninguém gosta, e parecem mais simulador de caminhada do que FPS, modificaram heróis e habilidades, retiraram as loot boxes que te davam chance de ganhar skins e demorou mais de um ano e meio para perceberem que foi um erro e voltarem com elas... enquanto isso, adicionaram coisas novas que ninguém pediu e para cada coisa boa que veio, tinha umas 5 ou mais bem ruins para atravancar os caminhos dos jogadores. É como se a Blizzard não quisesse mais ganhar dinheiro! Ela prefere vender para 10 pessoas um pacote de skins de 600 reais (é isso mesmo, vinham 5 skins e geralmente só uma ou duas que o jogador realmente queria),  do que vender para 10 mil jogadores cada skin por 20 reais! EM UM JOGO QUE VOCÊ NÃO VÊ A SKIN (é FIRST PERSON SHOOTER, você só vê a skin de vez em quando e se jogar direito)! Garanto que se fosse mais barato cada skin, ia chover venda, mas pedir de R$100 a R$600 por skin é piada, é chamar o jogador de otário igual a Balenciaga chama os clientes e compradores dela de trouxas ao lançar uma cueca rasgada e um tennis sujo por valor de carro usado da década de 90! É o mesmo princípio! Parece um teste social para ver o quão caro podem cobrar pelo pior serviço e produto possível! Overwatch 2 parece um teste do quanto uma geração que se ofende até pelo café da manhã pode ser usada!  Estão tirando leite de pedra e achando esse lucro satisfatório, mas poderiam estar construindo castelos enormes com as pedras de lucro se fizessem o que se propõem com respeito e dignidade! 
Também colocaram um sistema de IA para matchmaking e gerenciamento de denúncias que bani tudo, menos quem usa cheat de verdade, quem não cumpre a função, quem xinga de graça (mas ouse se defender pra ver se não toma um ban para sempre) e desde que essa ""excelente e eficiente""  IA (é sarcasmo, a IA de gerenciamento de denúncias e de matchmaking é a pior parte do jogo) de verificação de reports tomou posse do sistema eu já fui banido até por me referir ao Winston (um gorila) como ""macaco""! Me chamaram de tóxico, enquanto a pessoa que me chamava de tóxico me mandava tomar em lugares que não batem sol (mas isso não tem problema, falar GG no chat é banível, xingar a mãe não é);
Fui banido uma segunda vez enquanto estava banido... por usar o chat de forma tóxica, ENQUANTO ESTAVA BANIDO! Só se usei com a bunda!
Fui banido novamente agora permanentemente por usar o chat de forma tóxica ontem, sendo que estou com o chat desligado há pelo menos um ano, desde o segundo ban que tomei por ""toxicidade""! Claro que já xinguei no chat, mas geralmente é contra quem me xinga primeiro, agora tomar ban por chat tóxico com o chat DESLIGADO?!?!?! Palmas para  Blizzard! Se tudo isso não fosse ruim o suficiente, o battlenet te quita do jogo de 3 a 10 vezes por dia! TODOS OS DIAS! Nem mesmo linkando a conta com a Steam te livra deste problema. Vai falir se continuar assim! O jogo que me ensinou a ser tóxico agora cobra que não seja mais tóxico, no entanto, o que o jogo considera errado é: ABSOLUTAMENTE QUALQUER COISA! Tem gente que foi banida por falar GG, por pedir cura, por falar Feliz Natal no chat! Tem times que se juntam propositalmente para dar report em grupo em alguém só porque sim, quanto à isso a blizzard não faz nada. Mas pede cura no chat pra ver se não toma uma trolha de ban permanente! Não recomendo o jogo nem sendo de graça! Quem trata o cliente e usuário como algo substituível não merece o seu tempo e dedicação. Por mais que eu gostasse de Overwatch, não recomendo, não voltarei e tenho certeza que os outros mais de 200 mil reviews negativos também não! Mas se mentem que tem 20 milhões de jogadores ativos atualmente, não devem precisar da gente!

New characters like Freja and Juno are a homage to the incomparable and exceptional OG character visual design, however its a double edges sword since Venture and Hazard look horrendously ugly, in my opnion. As for gameplay, all of them are great and to me at least at feels like Bastion is finally balanced, but pls rework moira, she's the most annoying occurance that this game has ever seen. 

I got highly addicted to it and I find perks in particular very enjoyable. Lootboxes are back which makes me very happy. Although I don't want to seem grumpy, I still very much demand a huge PVE campaign, maybe not as grand as promised, but enough to uncover a new storyline of Null Sector Invasion and simply be fine.

Overwatch 2,2357570,207841959,"It's a mixed bag with this one.
I've been playing since 2017 OW1 
In it's current state of this review OW2 has improved, but still many things that should be acknowledged. 

1. It's built like Fortnite to put it simply. Paying for skins that are simple Epics all the way up to Mystic. It has it's equivalent to a battle pass which is it's seasons pass which doesn't make up for the overwhelming amount of skins they continue to drop that you have to spend money to pay for. This is only seen as negative imo because OW1 had only loot boxes which was an element to playing that earned you loot boxes and the excitement to open one and hope to get a Legendary skin or anything else which was always cool. Sure they brought them back in OW2 after the community complained, but then how they set up the loot box system there is nothing that you get from it now because they aren't adding new skins consistently that you can get without purchase from the shop, or even at least a chance to get mystic gems or credits to purchase skins from the shop. 

2. A positive is the core of the game playing heroes in matches that in itself is fun it's always been that way. The heroes are unique there is action, skill, game sense, teamwork and team strategy involved it hits ALOT of solid game notes and game winning plays can be made consistently it's all up to you and how you play in that match with your team. 

3. A negative again is an aspect that surrounds the game and that's how they decide what heroes get new skins. It's purely player based and so money based for them. They use the data from game and release skins based on what heroes are played the most/favored. For example Mercy, everyone knows she is the most played and most favored over all heroes, she ALWAYS has a new skin. There are heroes that have a solid fanbase but may not be as large, so say Mercy has 50 new skins that other hero will have 1 within that time frame. That's all to say they're clearly out for the money, and so really don't cater to all players in every aspect.

There is more to be said, but overall I do recommend the game for the gameplay itself that's why the community still exists and alot of people still play despite the negative reviews, but you should know the surrounding features of the gameplay you'll definitely develop your own opinion on it and it's what sparks the negativity.",True,1,895

If you had asked me at the release of stadium, I would have said Overwatch is saved (and in fact, I did)! They did what I and many others thought were impossible, they made the game fun again! Stadium was some of the most fun I've had in Overwatch, or any hero shooter, ever. All they had to do was add new heroes, and maybe a few more items. Thats all I needed, at least.

But then they added drafting. Each team takes turns selecting heroes, and if someone on the opposing team picks your character, you don't get to play them! Why? I don't know! Thankfully, they reverted that decision within a week of release, since it was so unanimously hated. I gotta give them props for that. The draft remained, but no character lock. Yipee! Back to the miraculously fun game mode.

But the they went and did it again. They went and introduced a quick play version of Stadium for a shorter, more casual experience. 5 rounds instead of 7. Nothing wrong with that, not everyone wants to commit to a full comp game, and thats alright. 

But then they made the Competitve mode the same length (5 rounds) as the quickplay mode!?! For what? Queue times? They sacrificed the entire appeal of the longer, more strategic format so they can shave off a few minutes of queue time? This SUCKS. There is no slow buildup anymore, you just show up and roll or get rolled, Almost every game I played ended on round 3, I never once had a team come back from a losing position. Theres no anticipation, no thought. You just go in, play mostly regular Overwatch round 1, get 80% of your build for round 2, and end things on round 3.

Maybe they'll revert these changes like they did the Hero Lockout, but every season I'll be dreading the next update. What will those geniuses try next? How will they disrupt my fun this time? I don't know, but I DO know that they're eventually going to pull some bullshit that no one asked for. 

I cannot possibly recommend this game to ANYONE, because even if you think its fun now, they are inevitably going to ruin it somehow.",False,1,20978

Overwatch 2,2357570,207699537,"What are my feelings about Overwatch?
It's complicated. 

I started playing way back whenever Mercy had originally only had guardian angel, and her ultimate which was rez. For a while, I played it religiously. As in got to masters in healer (with Ana and Mercy), Diamond with damage (Mei and Sombra) and finally Diamond in tank (With Zarya and Reinhardt). I thought I was pretty good at the game, and everything else. 

Hearing about the shutdown, I was pretty bummed. I knew the game meant a lot of new things, which I was reluctant to like because of change, but I figured nothing like that bad could happen.

With that thought, I figured taking a break would be fine. (For only like five-six months).

And that's whenever I played Overwatch 2. I played, and despised it. It's very money hungry with the fade of battle-passes and in order for you to properly get any prizes. I used to own everything that was Mercy related, but as soon as I looked at the heroes, I noticed I was missing quite a lot. (That's just a personal thing, it just peeved me lol)

The reworking of characters was also quite a shock. The Sombra changed through me through a whole loop, and I found it difficult to work with her mechanics and aim for so long until even now I kinda just see what happens. Mercy's jump was another big thing, where before you had to time it JUST right to go super high in the air? It was added to the game anyway. (People who didn't main Mercy wasn't super aware of it and it was GAME CHANGER).

Then the introduction to DOZENS of new characters. I personally felt so overwhelmed trying to figure out how any of them worked especially whenever it came without very *clear* ways to do it. We got several new healers, tanks and of course damage players. Which, was totally okay. (It was just a lot to catch up on, learn about, how to counter, etc).

Then comp. As I mentioned before, I was obsessed with playing it. I had practiced and everything else beforehand and was nailing Quick Play over and over with wins. I even went my main, thinking that everything would be fine. But, as I have seen comments that focus so much on the match-making, I could NOT agree more. I felt like I was with teammates that genuinely had no idea what they were doing. I don't mean making small mistakes, I mean having the lone tank charge into the back, die, then blame the healers. 

And I kept thinking maybe, I am the problem. But it kept happening, over and over and over. I put in my all, changed when needed, but literally nothing was working. Then with the new system they have for competitive, it decided to say what they think my rank would be before I actually finished. 

SILVER.
They tried to compare me to SILVER players. (Which I need to preface, nothing wrong with silver, but going from masters to silver is terrifying).

I hadn't touched competitive since then. So, what are my thoughts on this game?

It used to be quite the charmer of a game, with many characters with unique personalities, abilities and even so much lore to unpack. It was my favorite game for YEARS. Tied with The Walking Dead Video game series! (By TellTale + Skybound) But, even as I nearly have one hundred and fifty hours on just this account, I have over thousand on Overwatch originally. I think if they kept loot-boxes as a main prize counter, fixed and updated the matchmaking, and even just kept the same joy from Overwatch, the user reviews wouldn't be 'Mostly Negative'. 

But, that's my relationship with it.

P.S.
I do agree with the comments mentioning that Blizzard is just trying to use this game and nostalgia in order to get more and more money from you. It's utterly annoying that they want you to spend upward of fifty dollars for some prism skin, and the upgraded battle-pass. But, that's my spiel.",False,2,18492

If disappointment had a sequel, it would be Overwatch 2. Blizzard somehow took a game that was already running out of steam and managed to turn it into a half-baked, money-hungry carnival of recycled content and corporate gaslighting.

Let’s start with the “2” in the title — I assume it stands for “2 more battle passes, 2 fewer reasons to care, and 2 brain cells left after queueing for support for 30 minutes.” The “new” content feels like someone copy-pasted the first game, deleted a few maps, and added a PowerPoint presentation on how to squeeze $20 out of you for a recolored skin.

The PvE mode — the thing they hyped for years — died faster than your tank in a 1v5. The balance updates make less sense than the plot of a bad anime filler arc. One patch makes Cassidy a god, the next turns him into a decorative cactus.

And don’t even get me started on matchmaking. It’s like Blizzard replaced their algorithm with a dartboard and a blindfold. Half my games feel like an unpaid internship in pain management.

Overwatch 2 isn’t a sequel — it’s a cash grab masquerading as nostalgia. It’s Blizzard looking you dead in the eye and saying, “We know you’ll play anyway.”

I can also mention the inability for the teams I have been placed with to both keep their healer alive and watch the backlines.

all and all, if the matchmaking wasn't as broken, it may be a fun game to play. but as it stands, you mostly get hyper competitive, silent, and toxic lobbies. which make the game itself nothing but infuriating when you as a lvl 15 gets put up against a lvl155 over and over again. leading to the same exact issue league of legends has with new players. it is hard to get into a game where the only vocal players just insult you while you can't say anything back. if you soloq, you will have about as much fun as you would by using sandpaper as toilet paper after eating multiple scorpion peppers and downing it with a bottle of laxatives

Overwatch 2,2357570,207473802,"I'm an OG player of overwatch since 2016. I've reached T500 multiple times in ow1 and ow2. I've downloaded the steam version to finally put a review.

TLDR : the current game is in a very poor state. It's only there to sell you mercy and kiriko skins. Gameplay and matchmaking is 6 feet under the ground. Balance is poor. Gameplay feels meh compared to what it used to be. There is no competitive integrity and the game is entirely unfun, frustrating and utterly toxic. Keep yourself safe and out of this game.

I've waited very long to finally make a review. But this game is passed redemption since more than a year now, even after Marvel Rival got out, the game didn't improve much.

I've played the game since 2016. It used to be fun in ow1, the game might have been stale for a long time but it was still enjoyable to play even without much content. The ladder didn't feel too bad. Then ow2 came with big monetization. Which is technically not a bad thing as it helps putting out more content.

However, only the first few season of ow2 were nice to play and enjoyable then 5v5 became completely atrocious to play since S9. We're currently in S19 and none of the terrible changes from S9 were reverted (bigger hitboxes, bigger bullets, 250 base HP for squishes, etc). The team keeps believing that the current 5v5 version of the game is the ""main game mode"" while it feels terrible to play.

The overwatch team that made the game in 2016 is long gone and there is not anything from what made the game great left into the game today. The team barely ever listen to the community's feedback even when most of the reviews of their game are negative.

The balance is quite poor, the devs do not play their own game and the little part who does only play in very low elo where players don't know how to play the game. They take win/loss ratio statistics and buff/nerf heroes only based on that. Which makes them missing the point every time they make an update to the game.

The competitive integrity of the game has been atrocious since forever and it's gotten even worse since ow2. For the record in T500 ranking there is more than 50% smurf account which means players in T500 is not even close to 500 players. There were seasons where one player had 9 accounts in the top 10 which he got by manipulating the matchmaking by queue sniping, wintrading and abusing duo queuing with lower ranked smurf accounts with his friend. And the overwatch team didn't care the slightest about that.

You'll say ""ok but it's only for the T500 ranking"", nope. Most players in this game above gold (and even lower) have multiple smurf accounts that they use to ""have more fun"" by stomping lower elo players. This is how bad it is, if they want to have some fun, ppl just go and smurf which makes everything being even worse.

People also use smurf account to avoid sanctions after being uber toxic and silenced or banned on other accounts. Which means there is no point in reporting people as they all have 5 or 6 accounts which they rotate between bans. You get mass reported anyways for simply communicating whether it's toxic or not so most people are simply silent people scared of talking. I've been silenced just by defending myself while being insulted by someone else. You can simply say ""hello"" and get mass reported and sanctioned. Nobody checks the reports, it's all automated.

You have people going around being racist, homophobic, sexist, harassing people in game chat and even adding you on friendlist when they're muted just to keep harassing people and they can get away with it for days before being finally silenced for a couple of weeks. Once again, the team doesn't do anything against this type of behaviour.

The game is simply here to sell you battlepass skins centered of 3 female heroes that are popular. The mercy community is funding 90% of this game just by bying skins. The overwatch team is not interested into anything else. They just want to sell skins as much as possible before their game actually dies so they can make the investors happy for a few more quarters.

Each patch is worse than the other. Adds worse feature to the game that look good on paper but feels terrible to play. Take stadium mode as an example. The mode was fun and refreshing in its first season, then each single patch they made on the game mode made it worse. It suffers of long queueing time that has never been adressed effectively despite the changes to the matchmaking. They losened the matchmaking to the point legend players can be matched with rookie players who have neve played the game mode. Now there isn't something that deserved to be called ""matchmaking"" in this mode. And even with this, higher ranked players from all stars and above will have between 10 and 30mins queue. They added a quick play stadium mode which resulted in even longer queue times. Then they swapped from bo7 to a bo5 which was a disaster. Not to mention the draft mode they added that almost killed the game mode and makes it much much worse than it was.

All the features they added like ""map choice"", ""ban system"" made the game actually worse than it was. Those feature works well in a professional environment but on the ladder where gold players don't understand the game they are using those features completely wrong. Often sabotaging themselves and/or their own teammates by banning the heroes their own team wants to play. 

The team laughed at the community by saying ""you guys want 6v6 back, ok we're gonna make a test mode"". The 6v6 ""test"" mode was never an actual test as blizzard never put any balance work into it and then said ""see, 5v5 is better, it's gonna be the main game mode"". I'm not advocating for 5v5 or 6v6, it's just hypocrite to say to the community 5v5 is prefered while they didn't test it at all. Give us a full season with only 6v6 ranked as a role queue main game mode and collect data from it instead of throwing a game mode that is poorly made to say ""see, it's bad"".

None of the feedback from the community is actually listened despite the many content creators, streamers and seasoned players who actually play the game for multiple hours a day. The devs have simply no idea what to do with the game to make it better and throws random stuff at the wall to see what sticks.

All in all, this game is not worth investing any time in it. If you play a few games and you're lucky you'll have fun. Maybe with some friends if you fool around in quick play. This game has lost its soul and keeps getting worse. Stay away from it and your life will be better. That's the sad reality.",False,1,38

Overwatch 2,2357570,207470439,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ A Dynamic, Polished, and Addictive Evolution of the Hero Shooter Genre

Overwatch 2 has truly cemented itself as one of the most thrilling and well-crafted team-based shooters available today. Building on the legacy of its predecessor, Blizzard has managed to refine, modernize, and re-energize the entire experience while keeping the heart of what made the original game so special. Every match feels alive with energy, personality, and a constant drive to improve — both as a player and as a team.

🎮 Gameplay: Fast, Fluid, and Strategic

Overwatch 2’s 5v5 format is a brilliant evolution. Removing one tank streamlines the action, making battles more readable while still retaining depth and strategy. Each hero feels distinct, and no two matches ever play out the same way. Whether you’re darting across the map as Tracer, raining justice from above with Pharah, or commanding the frontline as Reinhardt, every role feels purposeful and exciting.

The pacing is spot-on: matches move quickly, encouraging aggressive play without losing the tactical nuance that made the series famous. The balance between mechanical skill and team coordination creates a gameplay loop that’s both competitive and immensely satisfying.

🧠 Heroes and Roles: Personality Meets Precision

The hero design in Overwatch 2 is second to none. Every character oozes charm, from their visual design to their voice lines and abilities. The reworks — especially for classic heroes like Orisa and Doomfist — breathe new life into old favorites, while newcomers like Sojourn, Kiriko, and Lifeweaver feel fresh and thoughtfully crafted. Each hero has a clear identity, and learning how they interact with others is a rewarding process that keeps the game endlessly replayable.

🌍 Maps and Visuals: Stunningly Crafted Worlds

Blizzard’s attention to detail shines through every map. From the sunlit streets of Esperança to the neon lights of Midtown, the artistry is breathtaking. These environments aren’t just pretty — they’re expertly designed for balance and flow, with countless routes and flanking options that reward smart positioning and teamwork.

The game’s visuals are crisp, colorful, and optimized beautifully, ensuring smooth performance even during chaotic team fights. Combined with the soundtrack and voice acting, the world of Overwatch feels alive and inviting — a rare feat for an online shooter.

⚔️ Competitive and Casual Modes: Something for Everyone

Overwatch 2 caters to all types of players. Competitive play is intense and rewarding, offering a clear sense of progression and improvement. Meanwhile, Quick Play, Arcade, and custom game modes keep things relaxed and experimental. Even the PvE story missions, though limited so far, show great promise and deliver cinematic-quality experiences that expand the lore in exciting ways.

💬 Community and Teamplay: Where Magic Happens

Few games capture the magic of collaboration like Overwatch 2. When a coordinated push comes together — the tank holds firm, supports keep everyone alive, and DPS land their shots — it’s a feeling of pure exhilaration. The communication tools are intuitive, the ping system is helpful, and when you’re in sync with your team, the game becomes something truly special.

🔄 Constant Updates and Support

Blizzard has shown real dedication to keeping Overwatch 2 fresh. Frequent hero balance changes, seasonal events, and the introduction of new heroes and maps ensure there’s always something to look forward to. The evolving battle pass and cosmetic system provide meaningful progression without forcing players into paywalls, and the devs’ engagement with the community has noticeably improved since launch.

🌟 Final Verdict

Overwatch 2 is more than just a sequel — it’s a love letter to teamwork, creativity, and competition. It takes the best parts of the original and evolves them into a sleek, modern experience that’s both accessible to newcomers and endlessly deep for veterans.

Whether you’re playing casually with friends or grinding through competitive ranks, every match offers a new story, a new challenge, and a new reason to hit “Play Again.”

Overwatch 2 is simply one of the most enjoyable, polished, and personality-driven shooters of this generation.

Final Score: 9.5/10 – An exhilarating, ever-evolving hero shooter that’s bursting with heart and fun.

oh, how naive we were.

ive played this game enough where the voicelines are ingrained in my mind. i see mei right around each corner, and roadhog is not far behind. i look up towards the sky, only to see wrecking ball fall down from the heavens and crush me where i stand. 
i should probably quit. i know i should. but at the same time, this game IS fun, and most of the characters are neat. out of all the hero shooters, i like this one the most because of how all the characters play, and back when they were still making some sort of story, i had fun following along. but most of that was before overwatch 2, before the battlepass and the free to play. now.... all that i can say is really left is the gameplay.

The indigenous people see these large flying structures and huge boxes filled with foreign objects, things that move or do things that they have never seen.

They believe that these people bring great things and that the objects they hold are things that can only be made with divine powers. Once those who set camp leave, however, the indigenous people are left with the hope of their return. They begin to build large structures, similar to things like planes or control towers.

Overwatch 1 was good, but Overwatch 2 is so much better in its current state. Playing the classic mode makes you realize how shit it used to be. Most of the recent negative reviews here are just people viewing Overwatch 1 through the lens of nostalgia, reminiscing about 6v6 and whatnot. The game also has more competition from other titles now, which is healthy. So many QoL updates have made the game feel so much better, along with the numerous balance changes over the years. Also, the game being F2P with constant updates is a blessing compared to what we had before. I play it all the time, both solo and with my friends. It's really fun, casually and competitively.

It's a fairly balanced hero shooter. You could main any hero and make it to a high rank. The skill ceiling on some characters is insane, you will always be learning playing this game. It has a rich roster to which new heroes get added every couple seasons. However, hero design has been rather uninspiring for the recently added ones.

One downside is that tons of people are toxic in this game. Unfortunately, you will be shit on by everyone and their grandma no matter what you do, especially if you're new to the game. Though, if you avoid falling for the rage-bait it's not too bad. There is a report-system but it is notoriously unreliable.

I see lots of people complaining about the monetization of the game. It is free to play. All heroes are unlocked for everyone. The person with all the skins will not have an inherent advantage over you. In addition to that, Overwatch also has one of the most generous loot box systems I've come across in video games, providing you with the same purchasable skins for free, just from playing. You couldn't even buy loot boxes if you wanted to. 

I never really cared about the PvE they were working on, but it sucks they failed to deliver on it for OW2. It has mostly been recycled into perks, the Stadium gamemode, and Story Missions. I do wish they expanded on the lore of the game a bit more. I've heard big things are coming our way regarding the Overwatch story, so let's hope for the best!

The game is in a really good state right now but it is still important to be critical of the less than ideal parts of it.

Overwatch 2,2357570,207213859,"I played during Overwatch 1 and to make a long review short, this game fucking sucks. It has completely ruined the game play that made it fun in Overwatch 1, I played Doomfist and Sombra in Overwatch 1, there abilities and gameplay was fun and unique even if Sombra was not that good of a character. But not in Overwatch 2, Doomfist is a tank which is the most unfun role to play unless you have a group of friends, and they keep changing and nerfing Sombra so that she can't even be recognized as the same character anymore. The game has not fixed match making and constantly makes people who solo queue like me have to fight against groups of players who team together, who actually communicate and coordinate with each other, while if your in solo queue their is a 90% chance people on your team will not be in team voice chat and will not hear any of the call outs that you make. 

I play tank and it is by far the single worst role to play in the game, it is literally one of the most stressful fucking jobs if you wanna do well, you have to keep in mind nearly every fucking element of the game to be effective. Not only that but even if you personally do well, if the dps or support on your team do not do a good job then your somehow the problem and they will call you shit and flame you.
 
As a tank you have to:
- Keep in mind the positions of your dps to know if you should apply pressure or not.
- Know what kinds of hero's your support are so that you know how much you can get away with.
- Keep in mind the enemies abilities and what they have, note every single skill usage you can see and hear so that you know what you have to fight against.
- Keep in mind the environment so that you can use it or avoid it. Which includes things like abilities that can change the layout of the map like Mei and her walls, or if your playing characters that can use the environment to your advantage.
- Constantly watch the flanks so that you don't get flanked.
- Have to deal with constant CC and insane damage from nearly every direction and angle.
- Somehow be at the same time cautious and careful so you don't push in to much and die and be aggressive enough to pull all the attention towards you. 

As the tank you are the single most important role on your team as if you die a team fight will most likely end then and there. So that also means that if you are losing or your team is doing badly there is a high chance people will blame you no matter what. If your dps flank and die 6+ times in a row and the enemy have a easy path to flank and kill your back line, they will blame you for them dying and ask why you did not help them. If your support(s) dies from any number of attacks or abilities and you as a tank have to face off against the enemy team with 1-2 supports down and then die because you have not heals, they will blame you and question why you always die even though they are the ones that are meant to heal and support you. Even if your support are literally doing more damage then healing and have 5+ deaths, they will still blame you stating that you should have protected them. People expect tanks to do nearly everything, they expect you to deal damage, to be a meat shield, to know when to push or pull the fight, to have perfect awareness about every ability that was used and the location of not only your team but the enemy team, and also be the anchor which the team rallies around. Teammates will expect you to perfectly understand their plans even if they do not communicate it at all, if you do not understand their vague message about their ult being ready or they are low, then its your fault.

They cranked the damage to 11 in Overwatch 2, they made it so that if you are not receiving near constant healing you will die insanely quickly. I remember when Reinhardt's shield could withstand a lot a enemy attacks and keep up for multiple seconds to help create an opening for your team to do damage, now its destroyed in under 8 seconds of fire and more used sporadically to block hits that actually matter and not just regular fire. When playing tank there is no room for mistakes, if your playing dps or support, if you die but your tank can hold out then you can come back and try again, but if you as a tank die then you lost the team fight and your team mates will flame your out for it. This entire thing would be half manageable if Blizzard did not balance with a fucking sledge hammer, they change major elements of the game and you have to constantly keep that in mind. They change major parts of a character to entirely change their play styles sometimes, they change your effectiveness widely, sometimes making some tanks absolutely the best and the meta, and regulating others to the trash bin, sometimes Zarya is the undisputed best tank, or Winston, or its what ever new tank is added, and you have to know it because their is one one tank on a team now so while the dps and support can play non-meta characters and have a little effect, if you don't play the meta or the counter to your opponent then you have a major disadvantage. Finally as the only tank on your team you are going to get counter picked, where the enemy team changes hero's to specifically counter you. So if you like playing characters like Hammond, Doomfist or really whatever, the enemy will switch to counter you, then if you don't switch then your 'throwing' and your team will complain.

This is the reason that the queue times for tanks is usually under 1 min and other roles are 2-6 minutes long, no one wants to play this awful fucking role. Don't play Overwatch, but if you have to or really really want to, then play any other role then tank.",False,0,10

Overwatch 2,2357570,207208337,"I'm a new player brought into this entire genre from Marvel Rivals' launch, to its slow settling into the smaller player numbers where it now sits. A few back-to-back negative changes and the matchmaking on Rivals brought me to try out OW2 over the summer. I remember playing a bit of the original OW but I was not a big fan of how it played, so I know I'm in the minority here, but OW2 truly is a fantastic game to play. If you're coming from Rivals the first thing you'll notice is the polish, better matchmaking, more creative and intuitive character design, smooth gameplay, and much more intelligently designed maps. It's also more competitive/sweaty, mechanically challenging, the menu design sucks and looks ancient imo, and the shop/skins and optional paid content tends to be of lower quality and more expensive. 

However, as I'm sure you can see the negative reviews, we shouldn't pretend that Blizzard has not made significant strides in making overwhelmingly positive changes to the game. We shouldn't forget the cancelled PVE content, or the erasure of the original game that so many people loved. But for better or worse, and as what many would consider a direct result of Marvel Rivals, Blizzard is making a real effort here now. So as someone who really jumped into OW2 during the summer of 2025 AFTER the good changes had been made, I truly think in their current states, OW2 is the better game and a fantastic investment of your time and patience to master the learning curve, especially in ranked. 

I don't think Marvel Rivals is going anywhere (contrary to the current sentiment), however I do think OW2 is the king of the genre for a reason, and it shows in the current iteration of the game. So I'll be playing, and buying skins/battlepasses like a pay pig, to send my message to Blizzard that THESE ARE THE CHANGES WE WANT. 

Who knows, if they keep this up, we may even get PVE or an Arcane tier show for the character's lore, which is so fantastic and underutlizied. So Thank Rivals, appreciate both games, and play the one that vibes with you best. For now, I feel like my time is more well appreciated and spend in OW2, at least until Rivals fixes that horrendously manipulative matchmaking system and certain characters that should not see ranked play.

Overwatch 2,2357570,207206365,"This game fucking sucks. Playing it is a genuine slog with almost zero redeeming qualities. Easily the best part is that a lot of the characters are interestingly designed and fun to play. However, there are equally as many characters who are terribly designed and make you want to uninstall by being on the other team. There's no soul like the game used to have. Where once they cared about progressing the story they no longer do. All they do is release a new cinematic explaining the backstory of a random character that's unimportant to anything and doesn't progress any of the plot that people expected from this game. The monetization sucks. Skins cost at or upwards of $20 and collab bundles cost more than the games they're collaborating with. There's blatant cosmetic favoritism where some characters have basically no skins at all while others get them constantly. Characters like ball, baptiste, venture, and lucio have to wait YEARS to get a new legendary while characters like juno and kiriko get cosmetics constantly pumped into their veins like they're recovering from a DUI in the hospital and are hooked up to an IV. Wuyang already has as many skins as hazard despite only being out for a month and a half, while hazard has been out for almost a year. They put more effort into collab cinematics than they do anything that is relevant to the story of their game. The gameplay is trash, most of the characters people play have one OP ass ability that's super frustrating to deal with that you always have to play around but takes almost zero effort for them to pull off using effectively. Most of the character kits that I like are on tank, which sucks because tank is an absolutely miserable role to play. It's the most banned class, and you can't commit to playing a character you like because the game becomes a match of counterswapping chicken. Some tanks hard counter eachother so you have to constantly swap to counterpick them when they counterpick you, and it just makes the gameplay unfun and boring. There are some characters who can counter your entire character with one ability (Ana alone counters almost all of them). It especially sucks when the most played tanks have are the best at countering so you kind of just have to swap if you see them depending on who you're trying to play. You have to play a hero with some kind of barrier basically every game because your team can't stay alive for shit if you try to play a dive tank and distract half the enemy team. You also always get blamed for losing despite having to swap characters the most out of any other role. The perk system doesn't even improve the gameplay because basically every character just chooses the objectively better perk and ignores the other one. It just adds snowballing rather than fixing anything. The only ""good"" changes they've made were in response to Rivals coming out and taking their entire playerbase, so they got desperate and had to start trying to make actually good changes. Hero bans is ok but there are characters who just get permabanned so there is almost no variety from game to game. Map voting is fine, but there's always a chance you get 3 shit maps and have to pick one, or one person votes for flashpoint when nobody else does and it goes there. The POTG system is also horrendous and values things way out of proportion from how they should actually be, which is especially bad because they've trademarked the system so better games aren't allowed to use one like it.

For a short recommendation, i dont recommend this game to anyone because of bad balancing and matchmaking.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]
There either is no matchmaking in Overwatch 2, or its rigged to be extremely bad for new players. Every match I played as a new player was against Grandmaster and Champion ranks. These are the two highest ranks in the game from a total of 8 ranks. Im falling off the maps still learning where the pathways are, while the enemy team has the skill and experience to kill me in 0.5 - 1 second. To make matters worse, my team has a single player of similar skill level as ''balance''.
Ive played with a friend who is experienced and the matchmaking is like this, and when I play solo the matchmaking is the same. There is no place to learn the game with a matchmaking that is this bad.

[b]Community[/b]
People dont communicate, and if they do its through the tiny text chat. A lot of people are extremely toxic and thats honestly no wonder with the matchmaking being as it is. You will get an experience similar to young people playing Call of Duty on console. Swearing using sicknesses and criminal accusations like ''pedo'' are extremely common. There is always someone to blame for something.
Ive had a single grandmaster player apologize to me for the bad matchmaking, and thats the best interaction ive had in 6 hours.

[b]Balancing[/b]
Aside from the horrible matchmaking, the characters are also poorly balanced. There are autoaim and beam abilities that outdamage anything skill based, and one hit kill abilities. AoE abilities that draw someone in, so there is no counter. 

[b] Privacy[/b]
Blizzard requires a lot of personal information in order to make an account, and its done in steps so you feel the need to complete the next step. This scummy way of asking for more and more information is a pretty big red flag ''you already provided all this, so might as well give more''.
Blizzard asks for your [u]Full name & Address, Date of Birth[/u] even though the game is rated 12+. [u]Email Address[/u] with verification, and [u]Phone number[/u] that also requires to be verified to check if its your real number.
The only thing they dont ask for is your personal ID number and the funny numbers on the back of your credit card.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I wish I had time back when Overwatch 1 was a thing so I could have experienced that, since the gameplay and gamemodes seem like they could actually be really fun. Unfortunately Blizzard ''Entertainment'' killed off the servers to Overwatch 1, only 10 months after Overwatch 2 came out... so that chance is gone.

I think people just didn't like the Overwatch community in general. But now that most of the salty playerbase has gone over to Marvel Rivals, it's chilled out a noticeable bit. (Still plenty of mad gamers everywhere.)

It's still an enjoyable game, but not one to take seriously. It became a bit of a cash grab after the exodus and they constantly have new and limited edition skins for $20 a skin, or $20 for a battlepass in which you can earn 2-3 skins if you play enough games for the exp., with an occasional cheaper skin released. 

I do feel like I don't come across as many bugs as I have in the past. I'll still never forget the moment I had a torb turret that wouldn't sit down on the high ground in Hollywood and just kept bouncing up and down without shooting. Even Genji paused and gave a sympathetic 'my work here is done' voiceline, I said ""Hard work pays off"" before he ko'd me.

Overwatch 2,2357570,206931134,"I don’t really get why people complain so much about skin prices - they’re just skins, lol. Most of the negative reviews are either from people mad that the game went free, salty 2016 veterans, or just random nonsense about porn (seriously?)))
The game doesn’t make you pay for modes, characters, or Prime status - and that’s already plus.
If you wanna play - just play.
The mode and map selection system before each match is actually really nice ( IMO ). Skins look good, and the collaborations are fun. I caught the One Punch Man sale-collab - not a fan myself, but it looked cool. Definitely better handled than the Apex anf Final Fantasy one (though yeah, they did let you swing a sword there, heh…)
Workshop - pretty cool addition. It’s the same feature many players asked for in other shooters (like Apex), but never got :D
Also, the game itself works as a really good aim trainer. It has every kind of shooting - clicking, tracking, vertical and horizontal aiming, even switching targets. That’s a huge plus (at least for me) In something like CS, you mostly deal with horizontal clicking and switching, but here you’ve got everything
Shooting feels good, the pace is fast (thanks for not being Valorant - it’s probably closer to Quake) The heroes are diverse, and finally it’s not just six “meta” picks. You can actually find someone that suits your style.

On the downside - weird FPS drops from 180 to 80–110 in some matches, plus short freezes. And sometimes, the first map after launching game runs at around 60–80 FPS for the first minute(+-) before stabilizing back to 180. Some people say the game takes a long time to close, but I don’t really care - okay, minus. (And something about ALT + F4, but I haven't tried it yet )

I think I’ll update the review after I hit around 100 hours, but for now, the overall impression is positive.
P.S. And really - why should I care what you think about it?      c:",True,5,7802

""But PvE was never the main point about the game"" It DOES NOT change the fact they lied to us and scrapped it. Not everyone is a multiplayer-only player. Most of OW1 players cared about the universe itself, and EXPECTED it in OW2

Core PvP hero shooter gameplay is still solid. Do I recommend it? If you only care about the PvP hero shooter part, feel free to try it. If you came here for the story/PvEs,  it's nowhere to be found.

Overwatch 2,2357570,206881967,"Nach all den Jahren mit Overwatch hat mich der Stadium-Modus endlich wieder richtig gepackt. Nach über 5.000 bis 6.000 Stunden Spielzeit auf meinem Battle.net-Account fühlte es sich erfrischend an, wieder etwas Neues zu erleben, das gleichzeitig an die taktische Tiefe des alten Overwatch erinnerte.

Gerade im Competitive-Modus war Stadium anfangs wirklich spannend: Es gab strategische Elemente, Raum für Comebacks, und selbst Spiele, die zu Beginn nicht gut liefen, konnten durch kluges Teamplay noch gedreht werden. Das sorgte für Nervenkitzel und echten Spielfluss – genau das, was Overwatch früher ausgezeichnet hat.

Leider hat sich das mit der Änderung auf nur noch fünf Runden komplett geändert. Der Modus fühlt sich jetzt unausgewogen, hektisch und frustrierend an. Man wird, sobald eine Runde nicht ideal läuft, schnell „outgefarmt“ und hat kaum Chancen, das Blatt zu wenden. Dadurch ist viel von der taktischen Tiefe und Spannung verloren gegangen, die den Modus ursprünglich so besonders gemacht haben.

Unterm Strich hat diese Änderung für mich persönlich das Spiel deutlich verschlechtert – ja, sogar „kaputt gemacht“. Aus einem spannenden, teamorientierten Erlebnis ist ein kurzatmiger, wenig belohnender Modus geworden, der kaum noch an das erinnert, was mich an Overwatch immer fasziniert hat.",False,0,13968

I played it on Xbox and moved to PC, played on battle.net for a few years until it moved to steam eventually.

This game has been shrouded in controversy, from name changes (#Notmycowboy) to just straight up abandonment from the developers.
It's funny that since the change of leader ship and shipping out those ""Unsavory"" characters, they're taught to say no means no... Then the new developers just say yes to everything, like this is life's equivalent of a pet hamster you've had for 4+ years. Don't know if it'll really move anymore but it's still there, twitching ever so slightly from time to time.

The only thing that really brought me back was Stadium, it was refreshing builds were interesting there was a massive change, a perfect shift into what would continue the legacy... (Although 3rd-Person is by far the most moronic thing to put in this game and players who use that stuff should be relegated to their own dumb servers.)

Nope they run head first into nobody asked for this territory, I find the recent changes of Stadium were one of the biggest let downs in this games history, disappointing, daft attempt at claiming all the Adderall using genji mains favor, folks who can't even tie their own shoes.
Followed by my most hated character of all time, Sojourn.
But the biggest let down, was doing such a massive change, literally adding characters, giving Gadgets, and Comp changes without a proper process for any of them, a full non stop horrid collaboration of raining parades.

I understand that I am bad at the game, honestly Plat is where I will lie for the rest of my life, I strive to be average and this is no different. But it's a shame that Overwatch claimed to strive for excellence, and yet failed their own ideals, it never had to be Overwatch 1.

It just had to be Overwatch.

Since I am on the topic, Blizzard is a large dev but with how the IPs are treated they're more like a small indie company who fails to recognize exactly what they're doing, which is simply shameful.

but overwatch? i'll be honest, it's dug itself out of a pretty big hole. perks and stadium especially are really fun additions, and i honestly prefer the modern hero design compared to how it used to be. also, lootboxes being back as just free extra stuff is great, feels weird to say i like lootboxes but here we are. plus, ranked drives are a pretty fun thing to do at the end of a season, pretty good rewards for playing comp in general honestly.
but theres issues, and i'll keep it simple. as good as the skins themselves are, i feel like i get my moneys-worth from dead by daylight and marvel rivals more when i think i've got some spare cash to spend on a game i like. overwatch is pricey, and theres no realistic way to get new shop skins for free unlike other games. also, the prices for the ultimate battlepass or whatever its called, and especially prisms are a joke. there is no way in hell i am spending £35 on a weapon skin, regardless of how many flashy effects are on it. also, minor gripe, plz plz spread the skins around, and maybe make them less, idk, ""horny-bait"".
but in simple terms, if you're good with not spending too much on a game, give overwatch a shot (again). it's clear that the games in good hands again, and more importantly, the team has and will make meaningful changes. theres a lot of effort.

like any other online games one can have bad or good games
have good or bad updates

but thanks to some characters variety of attacks and movements,  you can get used  to or you can find characters of your liking

the game doesn't need too many stuff to run, you can have your salty moments, good gaming bad gaming.

the game isn't bad as many say,  and as someone who has already over 1000 hours of gameplay here in steam, I can say i reccomend it if you want to try it or not, if you are of fan of shooting games, I even played this game before it got in steam and I assure it got better with the time.

yes there players that can be toxic, but well, at this rate, which game doesn't have toxic players? you can just ignore them and use the options to block them.

is your decision to try the game or not, and if you like it, you can play more, if you don't is okey too really.

the good side of this game is that is giving MORE reasons to play the game, thanks to the boxes you get by leveling up your heros. you have a small chance to get a skin.

but the important part for a game is that it gives you more reasons to play and not limit you temporary or  wait for the next season, it has small motivations for you play or not.

When you get a good matchup, it can be a great experience for both teams, but its often a stomp on either side due to uneven matchups.

Bad matchups with toxic teammates makes this game even worse as they will quarrel, or complain.
They don't understand when the server assigns us low ranking teammates, we just have to make do with it and no point quarreling with them.
Same goes for teams when we are the low ranked, they will ask you to kill more - as though demanding that or scolding teammates can increase the DPS/healing/skills of the teammates.
However dumb they are, if the servers does a better matchmaking job I believe this issue can be lessen.

Oh yes, and the numerous DCs that is a server problem - which punishes your groups of friends as the server kicks them out and suspends them for an hour so you can't play competitive together for an hour, hence ending the  day of play with friends or switch to quickplay.
Its horrendous, and so many people gets kicked by the server randomly, and we don't know why, and we get punished for it.

Pretty amount of flaws I would say.

On the bright side, when they work well, the game is great.
A good matchmade round will have an exciting fight for both teams, and when the servers are great, no one gets kicked, and usually the toxic people wont sound out when the game is balanced (though some still have complaints)

It’s always been one of those games I could sink into to relax and take my mind off real-world problems. The cute, colorful art style and the endlessly interesting hero interactions make it a genuine treat for the mind, and it’s hard to find another shooter with this much personality.

I took a break for a few years, but the new perk system pulled me right back in; since then, Blizzard has been delivering steady wins. Honestly, Marvel Rivals might have been the best thing to ever happen to the game because it pushed them to improve again. The new Stadium mode feels like a half-baked response to Valve’s Deadlock, though it’s still a cool idea in concept.

Bro, this game is like dating your ex who keeps gaslighting you but somehow makes you laugh mid-argument. Overwatch be out here looking all shiny and fun, and then BAM — some sweaty Genji wipes your whole team while your healer’s busy breakdancing in spawn.

The game slaps when it’s good. You land a clean ult combo, everyone’s hyped, your ego’s through the roof — pure dopamine. But then matchmaking hits you like a bus full of bronze players who think “objective” is a suggestion.

And don’t even start on queue times. I could legit learn a new language waiting to play DPS. Meanwhile, tank mains out here built like war veterans — traumatized but respected.

Blizzard, fix your dang servers and stop dropping “balance patches” that make one hero god-tier and another literal cardboard.

[list]
[*]Voice acting is quite good, each character has a very distinct personality and aura you can feel (which can be actually kinda helpful in avoiding ults lol).
[*]The sound design is very clear and crisp, which believe it or not, is quite important in a game that is very heavy on teamwork (at least kind of, I'll get to what I mean in a sec).
[/list]

[h1] The Good: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Character designs can range in quality, but for the ones that are good, especially female... there's a reason for why Overwatch has so many ""tags"" if you catch my drift.
[/list]

[h1] The Bad: [/h1]
[h3] Ah hell... [/h3]
[list]
[*]Matchmaking sucks. If you want to have some fair fun, party up with friends.
[*]Some of the things that I actually kinda liked(???) in Overwatch 1 that are just... gone here. 
[*]The characters are not very well designed. This isn't entirely the fault of Overwatch, there is certainly the fact that this is straight up a fundamental flaw for a wide majority of ""hero shooter"" games at large.
[b]1.[/b] This mostly derives from the lack of customization. Now, there is [i]some[/i] degree of customization via the selection of perks, but these perks are really not enough to justify the existence for a lot of these characters. This is where the comparison to class-based shooters (like Team Fortress 2, Titanfall 2, Battlefield, etc) come in. In those games, the classes have their own unique ""abilities"" or ""tools,"" much like heroes in games like Overwatch do, but you can still mold and bend these classes to your own playstyle via selectable tools and weapons. 
[b]2.[/b] In Overwatch 2, there are two types of character shortcomings. The first is that a lot of the characters feel... ""niche"" for a lack of better word. As in, you can feel like two (maybe even three) characters can be combined to create a more flexible and fun character with a much higher skill ceiling. The second is that Blizzard seemed to have actually kinda realized (maybe?) this issue, and tried to create a more ""generalist"" class, but again, due to the lack of meaningful customization, this just makes them a sort of ""jack of all trades, master of none"" character that makes them feel worthless. Not to mention Marvel Rivals does character variation kinda better, despite still suffering from the same issue by virtue of being a hero shooter.
[*]The ""solo play vs team play"" dilemma. Another thing that this game really fails at is being able to not just separate, but put in proper order when to mess around solo and when to actually play as a team. This comes via the ult system. When it comes to Overwatch, out of the gate you're pushed to play together as a team, letting tanks take the lead while the DPS spreads out (but not too far out) in order to create pressure from different angles, and the Support supports whoever needs the most support. But this is thrown out the window when a single player decides to use their ult. More often than not, these ults can completely break a well formed team push. Now, on paper this doesn't sound bad. Class-based games also have their own forms of stalemate breakers too. But the big issue is that there are some ults that require team cooperation, while others that can just screw the enemy team over on their own. This causes a break in momentum that most class based shooters don't have. A good example of this is the Medic's Ubercharge from TF2. It is very much a stalemate breaker ability that is activated by one player. Sounds similar to ults, right? But Ubercharges will forever be useless without team coordination. Fundamentally, the Medic literally cannot do anything offensive while Ubercharge is activated, and requires someone to be Ubercharged. Next, there is still the idea that Ubercharged players can be knocked back, so backup from the rest of the non-Ubercharged team is still required. This is what I mean by the ""order"" of things. In TF2 and Battlefield, you can just spread out and kinda just do your own thing, but when the time is right, the entire team needs to make a collective effort (that often tends to require very little communication surprisingly) to push. But in Overwatch, it's like a constant wave of needing teams and just outright spitting in the face of teamwork. It's confusing to say the least.
[/list]

[h1]Notes: [/h1]
[list]
[*]I won't be talking about the PvE Invasion thing since I didn't buy it and don't want to buy it (I'd rather fork over another $30 to Fortnite for a Miku skin, I'm being genuine rn), but from the let's plays I've seen and the criticisms levied towards it... I think it's safe to say TF2's Mann vs Machine is better.
[*]A lot of my criticisms definitely come from a place of my distaste for the ""hero shooter"" genre, so put this into consideration if you've read this far. My review mixes together both very biased views on the whole hero shooter schtick, but I also think I've provided some valid points to this game's not-so-great design.

Recommended? Yes (but only if you enjoy pain, drama, and looking hot while losing)
Hours played: Too many. My sleep schedule left me in 2023 when my kid spawned.
Posted: From spawn, because I got dove again.

💋 “Overwatch 2 is less of a game and more of a psychological experiment where I, a humble Widow main, try to hold a lobby hostage with sheer vibes and pixel-perfect aim.” 💋

I load into every match dressed in latex, armed with a sniper rifle, and absolutely zero intention of touching the payload. I'm not here for teamplay. I'm here for the click. One shot. One kill. One team screaming “WIDOW SWITCH OMG.”

Do I switch?
Absolutely not.

Every match is the same:

Spawn in. Instantly sprint to the highest, least relevant rooftop.

Grapple into the sky like a majestic French bat.

Land a headshot so nasty the enemy Hanzo starts typing in Morse code.

Immediately get jumped by a Genji with the emotional stability of a breadstick.

Die in shame. Repeat.

Meanwhile, our support is deep in Narnia trying to 1v1 a flanking Cassidy (McCree for old schoolers), the tank is RPing as a Redditor with a hammer, and our Bastion is arguing with someone’s toaster in voice chat.

💀 ""Widow diff"" they say.
You're right. I am different. I’m not playing the same game as you. I’m playing Fashion Watch 2. Did you see my new skin? No? That’s because you were busy respawning. 💅

Pros:

High highs. Low moral accountability.

You look fabulous even while feeding.

That one headshot that erases someone’s will to live.

Grapple hook = mental reset button.

Cons:

One dive tank and it’s wrap city.

Your team will hate you no matter what.

You will be blamed for everything. Stubbed toe? Widow’s fault.

Final thoughts:
Overwatch 2 is not a game. It’s a battlefield of broken egos and shattered dreams. But I’ll be damned if I’m not standing on top of it all, scoped in, with a 2% crit rate and a dream.

Jokes aside tho, currently the game is really fun to play. Blizzard has been caring about the game and you don't have to buy the battlepass to unlock heroes they're either unlocked by default or you unlock them by playing matches (tho they're usually only the harder heroes like Wrecking Ball or Echo), there are a lot of legendary skins you can buy by only playing the game and doing the daily missions.

There's honestly a lot to dislike about this game. The constant nerfing of characters that were never an issue, INSANELY overpriced shop items, and my control settings resetting when the feel like it are just a few. Nerfed most tanks into the ground---unless you like being a low-damage bullet sponge, play Damage. Wouldn't be surprised if they removed tanks from the game outright and just replaced them with 50-Shades-of-Mei (who btw so desparately needs to be debuffed). 

So why am I still recommending this? Cause it's fun to play; its a great game outside of the constant fumbling of nerfs and buffs. Its also free. You don't pay a dime to play this, and I'm kinda surprised they don't charge for it. I refuse to just give up when the character I play is debuffed, or when there's a $70 pack in the shop, so what? You don't have to buy it. Is it a sh*tty business practice? Yeah. Can we complain about it? Hell tf yeah. Maybe it's just me, but it's kinda crazy that THIS is the straw that broke the camels back for those who've played this forever. They gave us 6v6 mode back (AS COMP TOO) and they added a perk system that really allow you to have more control over your gameplay (ugh that sounded cheesy but still). Y'all complain when they don't change anything (i.e. pre Marvel Rivals era), and then y'all sigh and whine when they try improving and adding stuff to the game (i.e. perks, new characters, map voting system).

Overwatch 2,2357570,206466154,"I’ve been playing Overwatch since early 2018 and absolutely loved it for so many reasons. Fast forward to 2025, and after the disastrous launch of OW2 and all the surrounding drama, I can honestly say that in its current state, Overwatch 2 feels like the original, but with plenty of quality-of-life improvements, updates, and more content.

Earned loot boxes are back (and all your cosmetics carry over, of course), so I don’t feel any need to spend extra money to keep enjoying my mains. The game is frequently updated with new content and still includes nearly everything from the original (looking at you, CS2!), and retains that unique charm and gameplay I haven’t found in any other PvP shooter.

As someone who’s always played Overwatch casually rather than competitively, I find the community to be mostly positive, and the game consistently gives me a good time, more so than most multiplayer titles out there today.

All things considered, despite Blizzard’s past mistakes (and with ""pro gamers"" still finding reasons to complain), I genuinely think the devs deserve a second chance. The competition with Marvel Rivals seems to have pushed them in the right direction, and for the first time in years, I’m not only enjoying Overwatch again, I’m actually excited to see what comes next.",True,178,13486
Overwatch 2,2357570,206465534,"Personally, Overwatch 1 > Overwatch 2. Had the most fun and best memories on OW1 and with 1k hours on OW2 it was never as good and never will be and has only gotten worse for me with every update and corp choices (sold to Microsoft/Activision). Blizzard even before being sold was always very shady and betraying its community by promising lies to convince people to accept OW2, killing OWL, making it pay to win as at the start the new characters were locked behind the battlepass and with them being completely broken on release every time, and just the way it treats its community in general and the automated report system that has wrongfully banned many with Terms and Conditions that let them do what they want with you having no power to fight anything. Will stop playing this game as I got my best from the version killed, and try to find a new Hero shooter or competitive game to fall in love with. 

Generally for a new player (casual and competitive) I still wouldn't recommend this game, its very hard to get into and get good at with how the characters, Meta and maps are made. Besides that, there is no guarantee for the future of the game with it belonging to Microsoft/Activision, once it stops making a certain amount of money, the longevity of the game as well as its updates and improvements will significantly slow unless it gets cut off or replaced entirely.  Better to put your eggs in the basket that guarantees the games longevity no matter the financial situation such new as Marvel Rivals (Developer commitment: NetEase has stated their goal to support the game for at least 10 years, which Overwatch hasn't promised even a year let alone a decade), or something older such as Paladins (very loved by its community) or even something a lot more different and difficult such as Valorant (strong community, quite the big E sports scene and it with a similar ecosystem as they are even making their own MMO).

TDLR: I do not recommend anyone to play this, it's dead (OW1 my beloved), balancing is far bellow what to be expected of such a long running game,  new content is mostly skins and promotions that costs insane amount (Only battlepass is worth it), will not have a strong future (5 and 10+ years) and character design and release has been flawed and weak since Echo. Besides that, low quality artwork and content for fans to engage with, if any of it is made is mid-tier fan art quality being generous.",False,0,63482

This opinion is coming from a 14 yo so dont expect much.
I got recommended this game last year and it was REALLY fun (without knowing all the controversy). Something ive noticed is that i dont get matched with AI but with real people since i was in a group with my friend. Which was understandable. but that is how i found out the fandom is pretty toxic, but really not as bad as others. I loved using the ""its my first time playing excuse"", because it was actually true.

The negative reviews from ow1 players are totally understandable and they shouldve gotten a refund, i just think they overreacted a bit with the reviews. 
Overwatch has improved A LOT ever since marvel rivals came out, and marvel rivals just got worse.
-interesting new heroes
-bringing back old mechanics 
-Bug fixes
-amazing skins

With 409h on this game ive never met any other minor on this game except for my friend (which i dont mind).
One problem of the game that causes the toxicity is the scoreboard, i heard that ow1 didnt have it.
People judge someone elses game play way to fast just by the scoreboard which pisses me off and makes me kinda scared to try out new heroes even in unranked. Another complaint, tell me why Kiriko is getting 4 cosmetics this season? 1 ultimate BP skin, 1 shop skin, new mythic weapon skin & old collab skin coming back. Another thing is the price, other games have them waaay higher of course but ow2 keeping skins that people genuinenly want (yes the half naked Wuyang one) behind the ultimate pass, its just greedy, why cant you get it seperatly?
Still ive been addicted to this game like crazy, please let me go

Overwatch 2,2357570,206418582,"I was a massive fan of Overwatch, but like many others I completely dropped the game when ""Overwatch 2"" was released, as they ruined so much of the game.

Now some years later, the Overwatch team has taken big steps to improving the mess that was ""Overwatch 2"", and when I heard that they brought back lootboxes, and made it possible to actually gain some stuff in-game without having to deal with the battlepass, I decided to give the game another shot.

And it turns out that gameplay wise, they have absolutely managed to surpass the original ""Overwatch"", and the balancing seems so much better now. And they've added a lot of fun characters (like Ramattra). They've also recently been running some ""classic"" modes based on specific times in Overwatch's history (like the GOATS meta) for their anniversary event, where you've felt how awful the balancing was back during those times. I thought it'd be great to play those modes, but I just felt miserable playing that and wanted to go back playing the OW2 modes instead.

At this point, I do feel like the game does deserve to get a slightly better rating on Steam. Not saying they deserve a really good rating, but at least a mixed position. It is a fun game to play, but the fact still remains that they did screw up hard, and needs to keep working to improve the game. Personally I'm still really salty that the Archives missions from the original game are gone, as they're claiming that they broke because of the ""new"" engine, and that they killed the PVE campaign.

It's also about time that they made it possible to buy old battlepasses, and make them possible to complete whenever, because this FOMO crap needs to go away. Plus they really need to reduce the price of shop skins. It'd just ridiculous how expensive they are.

Overwatch 2,2357570,206093784,"Title: OVERWATCH 2 IS THE BIGGEST BETRAYAL IN GAMING HISTORY — I’M ACTUALLY SHAKING

Let me be perfectly clear: Overwatch 2 is not a game. It’s a scam with a user interface. Blizzard took one of the most creative, team-focused shooters ever made and murdered it in cold blood, then had the audacity to call the corpse a sequel.

They lied. They straight-up lied for YEARS. PvE? DEAD. Story mode? DEAD. Hero progression? NEVER EXISTED. They stood on stage, made promises, took the hype, took the money — and then said “oops, we changed our minds.” NO accountability. NO shame. NO care for the community that built this franchise.

And now what do we have? A game that’s barely functional. The matchmaking is pure chaos — you either steamroll or get demolished. There is no skill balance, no fairness, no reason to even queue. It feels like Blizzard is actively trying to make the experience as miserable as possible.

Heroes? BROKEN. Every patch breaks something else. They don’t even pretend to test anymore. You can feel the laziness oozing through every update. It’s like they spin a wheel labeled “RANDOM BALANCE CHANGES” and call it a day.

And the monetization? It’s predatory garbage. They took every greedy corporate trick in the book and shoved it into this thing. Twenty. Dollars. For. ONE. Skin. You remember when we used to earn skins by playing? Yeah, Blizzard remembers too — and they decided fun was unprofitable.

Now it’s all about the Battle Pass of Misery™, where you grind for hours just to unlock a voice line you’ll never use. The shop is a clown fiesta of overpriced junk. It’s insulting, it’s shameless, it’s disgusting.

I am so angry I can’t even type straight. Overwatch 2 is the definition of corporate greed — a Frankenstein monster made of false promises, lazy design, and pure disrespect. Blizzard didn’t just ruin a game — they violated the trust of an entire community.

The worst part? They act like they did us a favor. Like we should be grateful for this disaster. No. Absolutely not. Overwatch 2 isn’t a sequel. It’s a soulless parasite sucking the life out of what once was great.

Overwatch 2,2357570,206081236,"This game is awful. RNG to get good teammates entirely determines matches. You constantly get terrible random teammates while playing against 4mans+. The projectile size buff was terrible making it where you dont even have to visually hit the character to get a hitmarker. Ranked mode is entirely based off of match wins so even if you carry your team to a win you get no extra ranking. There is also a constant ""predicted"" that shows up reducing your ranking progress. There r a few characters in the game that r just extremely annoying to play against bc they take pretty much no skill to use. The people that play them will play like rats to get a kill while not even helping their team on objective. 

If you want a game where you r entirely dependent on your team to be able to get a win to go up in rank (which with this metric you can pretty much be carried by a good team so rank effectively means nothing) then this game is for you.

The only thing good I can say about this game in terms of a cross-platform FPS is that it IS CROSS-PLATFORM anf that the air assist isnt INSANELY strong nor do you have aim assist at all on PC when on controller. So it is at least competitive when it comes to controller vs M&K.",False,0,3191

However, all of the skins are outrageously expensive. It's sickening to think a gun skin can cost $40. Or certain collab/universe mixes can easily be $120+.

Battle pass is more reasonable and fair. You'll also get enough in-game credit (prisms) to get one mythic skin, which some are really cool and change both VFX/SFX for your gameplay. 

Don't give into FOMO.
Don't enable overpriced, predatory MTX practices.
Don't ever let Blizzard get away with the OW2 history, lies, and fiasco.
Don't engage with player toxicity (as you see in every online game) because you can get banned for anything. Yes, anything. It's not worth engaging. The bar for a ban is very low. Turn off all text and voice chat. I'm not exaggerating and yes I've experienced multiple temp bans or account silences ranging from being tilted, being toxic, and neutrally criticizing someones attitude, gameplay, or suggesting something politely. 

However, at the end of the day, with Stadium and Perks implemented, the gameplay is fun, dynamic, and provides good challenge and fun. Most of the time.

But time has passed for both of you - you've both matured as individuals. You're both mostly the same people, but with small little variations. For example, you took on more responsibility at work, so you don't have quite as much free time to line up with their schedule. She's moved into a totally new neighborhood, and as much as it's easier to see them now, you're not sure you like how close they are to some of your friends... and somehow, eventually, those small differences start to sow doubt and mistrust between you two. Despite knowing each other for years, you start to feel like total strangers to each other. Finally, after far longer than you're willing to admit, you start to remember why you broke up. All the frustrations, the little things that used to drive you crazy, it's all still there. You break up (again), and swear you'll never go back (again).

Overwatch 2,2357570,205963012,"This is the second-oldest good Hero shooter; the first one is Team Fortress 2. The only problem this game has is that it’s created by Blizzard, the worst anti-consumer company you can imagine. After the Marval Rival launched, this game has suffered in comparison as Rival is a successor to what the OW2 was supposed to be for Overwatch. But Blizzard turns down their anti-consumer tricks a little less to get more playerbase, which I give them some credit for. I joined OW2 in the first session and saw their predatory monetization when there was no actual good competitor. I left after the first session, but loved the core gameplay. I have joined S18 to see why everyone is saying it's not that bad anymore. People and Stremer are right, it’s in a way better state, but not as good as the Marvel Rival Level in monetization, but going in a good direction. If you can ignore the monetization part or just want to play for free, it’s a good game, but I like to support games that I like, so it’s decent for me at the moment. 

[b] A few things they can do to fix the monetization - [/b]
[list]
 [*] Make the Battlepass not expire if you bought it, like Marvel Rival. 
 [*] Battlepass should give 100 Mythic coins in BP, as every mythic skin, if you want to unlock the full set, it costs around 100. 
 [*] Weapon inspect should be the default for every hero. for the mythic gun, it should add another inspect for the gun.

- Matchmaking is down right awful. I don't know why the matchmaking in this game feels like it needs to punish solo Q players. No I don't always blame my team for losses. I know it sometimes my fault that I could have played better, but why does Blizzard find it acceptable to match me against the same 3-6 stack every match? If you solo Q and there happens to be a stack in your region you're going to see them non-stop in competitive. The matchmaking does not stop for a second to think, ""Mhhh this guy has played against this same group for 3 matches in a row and we keep giving him the same random team, surely we should look for an alternative match? Nah 4th time is the charm."" Getting placed on the apposite side of a 3-6 stack team wouldn't be such a bad thing if people decided to use mics and communicate with each other. But this is Overwatch in 2025 were talking about, everyone who plays this game is anti-social and has social anxiety.  Just saying a simple ""Hello"" in VC is such a daunting task for anyone in this game that they'd rather get backshots from the enemy stack than communicating. But when things go bad everyone types 500 Words per minute and flame the tank and DPS. If 10% of this community applied themselves in any other aspect in their life I am convinced we would solve most modern problems like a cure for cancer, world hunger, and global conflict. But these degenerates rather be spending 12 hours a day bad mouthing other players for a singular mistake and never look in the mirror. Oh and Mercy players... you all ain't cute and think your the main character because you hold left click and occasionally fly around pressing shift. I hate you the most because you contribute nothing and blame everyone else for your failures.  

- Stadium caters to all the characters that sell skins and leave them broken for months on end until. They nerfed Freja in less than a week after being put in stadium but continue to let a character like D.va have the ability of having a broken dumb builds is beyond annoying. Which one do you think is selling more skins? 

- The dev team preaches about creating a safe-space for the community, but over the last 5-6 months in my ranked matches I see p*do jokes, racism, sexism, and even had a couple instances of hearing terms thrown at minority groups in VC. You'd think they get banned right? Nah I still see them in my diamond-low master lobbies. But they banned a guy for saying ""Noob."" There's the morale compass this team believes in, only after getting called out did they deem ""Noob"" was fine like all the other racist, sexism, and other stuff I hear and read in game. The report system barely works and has been known to wrongfully ban players with Blizzard support basically telling them ""Sorry you're out of luck."" Oh and its perfectly fine to brag about smurfing in this game, the devs and report system don't really care. Only way action gets taken against players is when mass-reporting happens to an account and the automated system does the job blizzard is to lazy to do. If a stack of players decide to report you than your account gets flagged and eventually can lead to an undeserved ban. 

- Balancing philosophy is stupid, I'm convinced there's not a single person on the dev team who is above silver 5. They hear about broken characters and just change very minor things like -/+ .5 seconds off an ability and never address why a character is broken or annoying to play against. Kiri hardly ever gets touched because you can't touch the golden children in this game...

- The skin economy is beyond stupid in this game. You can guarantee three characters are going to get skins every season. Kiri, Juno, and Mercy. Not just a ""Skin"" no I mean ""Skins."" You like a certain character that isn't gooner friendly? Well I hope you enjoy grinding loot boxes for some old OW1 cosmetics and OW2 season passes skins so that you can MAYBE get that characters skin. This dev team better be thankful for all the gooners this community has because allot of them would be homeless and out of a job. (Just look at Mercy's persona collab skin.) Oh and if your favorite character doesn't sell skins then they'll never buff them to make them as viable as other characters. Kiri never gets touched despite the community wanting changes to her Suzu, Damage, and TP. She sells so its fine to leave her in a unbalanced way. 

- If a person who enjoys Overwatch hears you say ""They didn't deliver on any of the promises they said about OW2"" they'll tell ya to move on. Honestly, you guys are whats wrong about live-service games. I spent money for the original release of the game in OW1 and it got taken away from people like me who actually misses the developers pouring their actual love into this franchise. Now you're just a wallet for them to keep scamming. Yeah Jeff could have made the transition easier, but you can't tell me OW2 isn't a downgrade from OW1 in its current state. 

- They introduced a ban and map voting system. While I think this is the one positive change this game has done, lets not kid ourselves and say this wasn't because of RIvals bringing competition to the market. They could've done this earlier and implemented features the community has been wanting for years, but all is forgiven because now it has a direct competitor? Nahhhhhh its scummy and insulting. This game was printing money because every game that tried to compete with them sucked and there wasn't a decent alternative. 

- Every new character they come out with has little to no soul attached to them. The last two characters they came out with that had any semblance of being cool and unique was Ramattra and Junker Queen. Actual characters that had some story and awesome design. Since then? 

[list]
    [*]Kiriko - A cliche anime shaped character with a back story that contradicts what little lore this game has. 
    [*]Lifeweaver - A hyper flirtatious guy with roses...
    [*]Illari - Such a fumbled character, an interesting premise and back story that they never expanded because she doesn't sell.
    [*]Mauga - Hey lets put Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in our game... oh he said no? Give him two miniguns and some hair so people wont notice.
    [*]Venture - They eat rocks, isn't that funny guys? Lets forget they ever existed and not throw her skins for a few seasons... takes away resources for our female characters.
    [*]Juno - Another generic anime figure who lacks any social awareness. Oh she's an astronaut? Lets make every new skin for her non space-themed and more gooner friendly. 
    [*]Hazard - Oh people really liked the concept artwork before this new dev team took over? Nah that's to original. Just make him generically buff with spikes. 
    [*]Freja - Another boring designed character. But this time lets give her a personality that matches her design. 
    [*]Wuyang - Honestly just feels like the dev team said ""Lets take Juno and Kiriko and just make them into a guy."" His kit is unique I'll give them that, but like majority of the new characters made its just another fucking boring anime inspired character. 
[/list] 

Yes this game is addicting, but its really hindered by a greedy dev team that doesn't really care about making it better. Only reason we saw changes the last year is because another game decided to copy its formula and do somethings better and a group of the community wanting to jump ship. If you want to play it then go for it, but just turn off voice/text chat because the community is worse than the actual people in charge of the game.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205910763,"Let me sit you down and tell you a story about love, pain, and pixelated betrayal. This ain't just about a video game, sugar—this is about a lifestyle. A spiritual journey. A battle between good and evil that plays out every night on my monitor with more drama than a Tennessee divorce court. It’s called Overwatch, and it has chewed me up, spit me out, and left me cryin’ on the kitchen floor with a cold cup of coffee and a disconnected headset.

Now, I’ve been playin’ this game since God was a child. From payloads to control points, from quick play to comp hell—I’ve seen it all. And the one thing that ain’t changed? My teammates still play like they’re tryin’ to sabotage me on purpose. I swear, every time I solo queue it’s like Blizzard spun a wheel labeled ""NPC Behavior"" and slapped five randos together who collectively couldn’t read a mini-map if it was tattooed on their foreheads.

I got tanks with zero brain activity, supports off on spiritual retreats in Narnia, and DPS players who think they’re on America’s Next Top Widowmaker—posin’ instead of shootin'. It’s a hot mess, and I’m the poor soul tryna duct tape it together with heals, callouts, and one single strand of hope I keep in my sock drawer.

Now let’s talk about the real scandal—Kiriko. Oh baby. Kiriko out here livin’ her best anime girl fantasy. She’s got a new skin every four business minutes. Battle pass skin? Kiriko. Mythic skin? Kiriko. Limited-time event? You guessed it—Kiriko in another flawlessly tailored outfit that makes her look like she just stepped off the set of a magical girl reboot and onto my kill feed.

Meanwhile, my girls Symmetra and Echo? They sittin’ over there like extras in a budget sci-fi movie, wearin’ the same dusty outfits since launch. No updates. No love. Just silence. And I say this with every ounce of respect—where the hell are my thigh-highs and latex body suits?

Yes, you heard me right.

I want Symmetra struttin’ into battle lookin’ like a futuristic dominatrix who builds sentry turrets by day and breaks hearts by night. I want Echo glidin’ through the air in a glossy, black latex bodysuit, high heels clickin’ in the kill cam like she’s about to drop an electro-pop album on her way to a 5K. Give her LED trim, high-fashion lines, and the audacity of a villainess in a cyberpunk novella. You gave Kiriko a streetwear collab and Cassidy a gun made of lava—don’t tell me this is too much to ask.

I’m talkin’ full glam. I’m talkin’ style that could kill before the ult even hits. I want Symmetra with a side slit and Echo with wings dipped in chrome and attitude. Put some lace on those thigh-highs. Put some vengeance in their eyes. Let these women slay on the battlefield and on the runway. Don’t be shy, Blizzard. We’ve seen what you’re capable of. Give the girls what they deserve.

And don’t try to feed me another recolor from 2018. I want the devs to feel slightly ashamed and also very proud when they hit “Publish” on these skins. I want a Twitter debate. I want fan art. I want my matches interrupted because the enemy team stopped to admire Echo’s latex-fitted wing plating.

Meanwhile, the game itself? Still a mess. Ranked is as busted as a gas station microwave. Balance? A fever dream. I’ve seen Moiras with 20k damage and 4k healing, Junkrats who think the floor is lava, and Hanzos who couldn’t hit a barn if it was sittin’ on their nose. Every other patch feels like someone at Blizzard is just tossin’ changes in a cauldron like it’s potion night at Hogwarts.

And still, despite the chaos, the heartbreak, and the emotional damage—I log in. I queue up. I pick my mains, pop my cooldowns, and carry teams like I’m draggin’ a pack of overcooked biscuits through the mud. Why? Because deep down, I still love this trainwreck of a game. I still believe.

But Blizzard… baby… give me latex. Give me thigh-highs. Give me divine justice for the girls you left behind.

Until then, I’ll be on the payload, wearin’ imaginary couture, mutin’ my teammates, and prayin’ that one day, Echo’s wings won’t just be functional—they’ll be fierce.

Amen. GG. And let Symmetra serve, not just shields—but looks.

-No player agency. The game is team reliant to a disgusting degree. You are nothing without your team, and thus you are completely at the mercy of randos in order to play the video game whatsoever.

-Worst matchmaking on the planet by design. If you are on a winning streak you are purposefully paired with braindead animals for the next 2-6 games.

-Horrible balancing, just as it was in OW1. The only difference is now the devs respond to *some* feedback *slightly* quicker. Even with that, some heroes with huge leads in ban/win/pick rates are completely ignored by devs-- some of which being ignored for upwards of 7 years with no major changes/reworks. Additionally the power-creep seen over the past few years and giving almost every character more movement abilities has been really sad to see.

-Horribly toxic and defensive community. Everyone is on edge at all times, even in quick play. Ranked is a complete nightmare full of entitled morons that are looking for any excuse to relay 10,000 slurs in chat after throwing the game for their team.

-No good answer to counterswapping. If any of the tanks in the game are your favorite characters in the game, enjoy getting counterswapped after getting one kill on an enemy. If you're playing D.va and the enemy goes Zarya, or if you're playing Winston and the enemy goes Reaper, or if you're playing Roadhog and literally anyone swaps at all-- well sorry I guess you just can't play that character anymore unless you're okay with throwing the entire match.

-Reduction of the core game to 5v5. This exacerbates the counterswapping issues mentioned above because half of the tanks were never designed to be the main characters in a match. You also lose out on a large amount of unique gameplay scenarios and combos that 6v6 provided. But because Blizzard didn't know how to balance it they just literally removed a player slot.

-Integral competitive features coming far too late. Only recently getting hero bans, the ability to see weapon/ability stats, and map voting after 9 years of Overwatch being released is a joke; even the state those features are in are unsatisfying and bare-bones.

-Only one badly priced, uninteresting PVE campaign with no talents/perk system as promised.

-Predatory monetization with a new 30 dollar Mercy skin bundle released every week. It was much worse on launch with new heroes being paywalled, but even in it's current state it's still a joke.

-Loot boxes. They reversed their decision to remove loot boxes as a way to appease players and give a more enticing reward for events; but the current iteration gives you complete garbage and no basically rewards for duplicates whatsoever.

-Godawful writing and ""lore."" I don't even need to expand on the ""lore"" bit since there basically is none, and for writing just listen to Venture speak once and you'll know what I mean.

-Optimization gets worse every single patch no matter what rig you're running, and every new patch introduces numerous bugs throughout all aspects of the game.


Recently there are two large gameplay additions that are supposed to renew player interest in the game; those being the perks system and the stadium mode. So let me talk about those a bit:

-Perks are this game's system of an item shop or talent system in the core game. You earn EXP by contributing to the match and can choose a couple talents to improve or modify your character's playstyle. This was made to disincentivize counter-swapping. Unfortunately realistically what it boils down to is that the team that starts with a lead (which most likely is the team the game calculated to be the winner during matchmaking) can more easily hold the lead and snowball easier, especially since if anyone on the losing team swaps their EXP resets to 0 for the new character. Some of the perks also re-introduce CC that was previously removed due to overwhelming negative player feedback such as Mei being able to freeze enemies again... ??? Who on earth thought this was a good idea???

-Stadium is a mode that literally does not allow players to swap, and instead can (in theory) build their characters in vastly differently ways each round in order to potentially play around the enemies or their own team. However the execution is pretty botched, the items you can buy almost have no noticeable effect on the game until the last couple rounds (you can buy 5% attack speed...Wow!!!). If the items were slightly more impactful I don't think I would have much of an issue-- the real problem is again the horrendous matchmaking that purposefully pairs you with braindead swines that don't know how to read or use a computer.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205893134,"So, I never played Overwatch 1. When I first started playing ow2, you had to unlock a vast majority of the characters, which kinda sucked. And then, at some point, they made you start with all of those characters, which was a very welcome change. Since then, I've seen the game continue to go mostly upwards, Sure, there's been a few changes that people hated (road rework, sombra rework), but they've been genuinely listening to their players now and reverting things or changing them to a point that people like. They released Stadium, which, while not totally my vibe, is welcome by many others. They also added 6v6 back, which (while I can't comment on how it compares to OW1 6v6), its fun. Fair, I'm not super high ranked, so I don't feel the pain of long queue times (average q time is about 1 or 2 minutes, max for both qp and ranked). I am almost never stuck as a solo tank in 6v6, and the community has been rather nice. I don't get yelled at (er, well, mostly not), and when I do, uh, its fair. No one wants a doomfist that falls off the map. Every minute. 

Moving on, though, the hero design always impresses me. Skins are good, but the actual gameplay feels smooth and I never feel like I reached the skill cap of that particular character, Doomfist always has more I can learn, both in terms of techs but also how to use his movement better. Unlike some other games, where the abilities are super 1 dimensional, this is nice. I can keep learning, instead of just getting better at aiming and being in the right position. 

8/10, good game. Theres room to improve, but its free and fun. I can't really explain.

Really sad to see. Also hilarious that we get sloppy ai images in overwatch before a Ramattra dance emote lol.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205568245,"I've played this game almost entirely - since release - as pharah, then genji a while after overwatch 2 came out. I always appreciated the custom controls and reticles after they were released. I have an issue using my preferred method of input now that I have yet to find a remedy to. 

I dont know why they changed things from how they were but I used to be able to play with controller in my left hand, for movement, and some buttons, and mouse in my right hand for aim, and a few buttons. 

A few patches ago I was suddenly unable to play pharah entirely because I couldnt ""hover"" with the thrusters any more. Now, I cant play any characters with my setup because the game doesnt allow a seamless switch between controller and mouse during play. It used to be able to be ""fixed"" by forcing the ui to display either keyboard or mouse only, which would get rid of the ui changing back and forth every movement/flick of the mouse, but now you just cannot use both at all. 

I dont understand the necessity of changing things that have never been an issue. there has been nothing introduced that I can tell that necessitates changing this function whatsoever. Overwatch has been on a steady decline since before ow2, since before jeff left, before goats meta etc - and this is just the final drop in the bucket for me. I quit for over a year when they went back on their promises for pve and made it clear they had no intention of developing that + started pushing out inane character designs with ai-generated ass identities and stories.

Here's another Negative review and from someone that has never played the game, and is actively restricted from playing it.
Some might be asking why? Here's the answer.
Blizzard doesn't accept my phone number and that's the only way you can play this game. 
You must have a post-paid phone number, which can be heavily impacted by phone plan providers. (Some will work some won't). The cause of this issue, may be where i reside as i'm from the EU.
There is a chance that you may never get to play this game because of this, i certaintly can't.
Some of the later patches have made this worse as i've understood where temporary phone numbers don't work
as Blizzard requires you to renew your SMS after 120h.

I would love to hear suggestions and solutions to my problem, thank you.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205492043,"Overwatch has been one of the few games that got me hooked into the PVP genre, and i've been playing it since 2017,  Switching over to this brand new type of game since playing Call of duty was fun and enjoyable, i made tons of friends and absolutely loved this game, but stopped right after the announcement of role-que and eventually quit.

Ever since then i have tried numerous games like Rocket League, Apex Legends and R6 Siege to capture what overwatch was once to me. However there never was the feeling in any other game of coming back home after a busy day and just playing Overwatch until you pass out and there never will be.

Since both the announcement of a sequel and the questionable turn it took at its launch, i tried it once again, this time ""Overwatch 2"" and although it had a huge change in monetisation and game mode changes, It was still harbouring the same ""Overwatch"" i enjoyed but since then a lot of promises have been broken, and a lot of bad decisions have been made no doubt, and i quit once again, At the time i never enjoyed it as much as i did and i felt like the game had taken too much time or changed way too much in certain ways for me to replicate that feeling again.

Then i took a long break and I finally came back very recently and found myself excited for every match i play, even if we won or lost i still had absolute fun the past few weeks playing this game again. Loot Boxes are back, Currency is easy to earn and there's tons of events at every corner to keep you busy. Overwatch 2 has never been more fun for me and i think that was the biggest realization I've come to is that the game at its core is still what i personally find the most enjoyable so far. even in the current sea of games and most importantly i didn't need to replicate that exact feeling i had i just need to keep having fun with newer ones.

To anyone who wants to try this game, absolutely do it. To anyone who was promised a lot of things and never got them, i completely understand you and i hate it too and don't blame you. To anyone who gets pissed off or slowly get uninterested, Take a break, no matter how long and come back again. and to all of you, just try to have a fun time no matter what. that's how i enjoy this game and I'm excited to keep playing more towards the future till the very end.

Honestly, all I care about is if the game is fun. As someone who played OG Overwatch back in 2017, lost interest after the hard pivot towards competitive-first balancing and continual dip in content around 2019, and rejoined the fray this year, I honestly think the game is in one of the best spots its been in terms of pure gameplay. The balancing is not perfect of course, but I rarely feel like the game is unfair to the point of being frustrated. I literally do not care that it's 5v5 now, the team dynamic is still enjoyable even in quick play. The influx of new content is exciting, even if it's a lot of cosmetic items. I'm glad that loot boxes are purely obtained via progression and aren't just straight up gambling, and that the option exists to buy skins directly, as they are still ultimately cosmetic and don't have any impact on gameplay.

Calling this a sequel is like putting a new sticker on an old toaster and charging triple the price — it’s insulting, lazy, and frankly embarrassing for Blizzard Entertainment.

The switch from 6v6 to 5v5 was supposed to “evolve” the gameplay. Instead, it nuked the balance and left matches feeling like chaotic messes where one bad tank can single-handedly ruin the game. Tanks are now glorified punching bags with identity crises, supports exist to be target practice, and DPS are still playing Call of Duty in the corner.

And the monetization? It’s a joke — a greedy, tone-deaf joke. Skins that used to be earned through actual gameplay now cost more than entire indie games. The “free-to-play” label is just a fancy way of saying “pay us to have fun.” It’s less a shooter and more a shopping mall with guns.

The biggest insult of all, though, is the gutted PvE mode. Blizzard dangled it in front of fans for years like a carrot, then ripped it away and handed us a sad, watered-down mission system that barely qualifies as content. It’s bait-and-switch at its finest.

Underneath all the corporate nonsense, the Overwatch 1 DNA is still there — and that’s the only reason this game is remotely playable. But everything new Overwatch 2 tries is either worse, broken, or painfully cash-grabby.

Final Verdict: This isn’t a sequel — it’s a glorified update wrapped in a cash shop and sprinkled with broken promises.

Balance is also all over the place. Some characters definitely feel favored in terms of how strong they are, while newer heroes often feel powercrept or just not as viable. It can make matches feel frustrating and uneven.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205354006,"Overwatch 2 Review: Worse Than a Walk in the Park

One day I went to the park, touched grass, saw kids playing tag, and realized it had better balance and teamwork than Overwatch 2. At least in tag nobody’s paying $20 to cosplay as Kiriko, a hero who’s already mid to begin with.

Blizzard deleted Overwatch 1 just to sell us a downgrade with overpriced skins and zero soul. I’d rather watch pigeons fight over breadcrumbs than queue another match.",False,2,20
Overwatch 2,2357570,205353219,"Well, here it is, my review for Overwatch 2 (OW2). Note that my playtime on Steam isn't accurate, as I play on the Battle . NET version a lot more (my Career Profile states I have 1,854 hours in-game, but that probably doesn't count menus and was probably reset from OW1 to OW2). I have been playing Overwatch since the first game, and before Season 1 of Competitive Play was even a thing, I'm from the old times.

Honestly, this game is what many people have always asked from Triple-A game developers. A Free to Play game where the only monetization is behind cosmetics, and NOT gameplay mechanics. Now, I will give a brief history that this wasn't always the case, and I'm glad that Blizzard / Activision has decided to step back with some of their earlier decisions when OW2 was released.

In this actual Free to Play game, you have a variety of heroes to choose from, Damage heroes, Tank heroes, and Support heroes. Each one of them feel very unique, and as how matches go, think of Team Fortress 2 (TF2) but with MOBA mechanics. You have abilities on cooldown, you got Ultimates, and so on. Unlike MOBAs, you can switch heroes at anytime, at the cost of a % of your Ultimate charge. Recently, they also added ""Perks"", that you unlock during gameplay per match, and you equip them on-the-fly. It's a great system that makes matches feel more different and more varied.

Netcode feels very good overall, and I don't have any issues with it. In the early days of OW2, and even on OW1, there used to be some disconnects here and there. I think most of the time, things have been a lot more stable. I'm not a Competitive Player, but playing Unranked always felt as it should be. At least where I live, South America, sometimes I can get to North American servers (something that would also happen on OW1, mind you). It seems this rarely happens nowadays, perhaps only when there's barely any people queueing for a specific gamemode on my country.

As for gamemodes, there's a couple to choose from. You have your standard game of Overwatch, where you can play Unranked, Competitive, or Versus CPU bots. Competitive also include a Role Queue and Open Queue modes. Role Queue is 5v5, with 2 Healers, 2 Damage Heroes and 1 Tank, while Open Queue lets anyone choose any role during the match, but tanks are limited to only 2 (you can have a match with 4 Healers and 2 Tanks, or 4 Damage heroes and 2 Tanks, etc etc.).

There's also Arcade, which are more of the ""party-game"" game modes that Overwatch brings. Sometimes you get some that are Event-exclusive, that changes each Hero moveset, or a completely different gamemode altogether (like Prophunt). I haven't mentioned it yet, but in a match, no one can pick the same hero more than once, from your team, but on Arcade, there's a mode for No Limits that lets you pick as many times the same hero. My favorite Arcade gamemode has to be Total Mayhem. It's basically what if Overwatch was Mario Kart, and it's a lot of fun. There's actual strategy behind this frenetic gamemode, and there's a couple Heroes I only play there. Lastly, sometimes there's ""Classic"" mode, where you can play as how OW1 was years ago. Honestly... the game was really jank before, you can really see the difference if you play that gamemode and what is currently on OW2.

Finally, there's Stadium, which is a pretty recent addition to Overwatch. It makes the MOBA elements on Overwatch even more apparent (no Hero switching, purchasing upgrades at the start of a match, and so on). I have played a few matches and it's a lot of fun, you can really feel the Hero you picked becoming stronger, and there's a lot of fun combinations you can go with. You have stat upgrades, as well more ""Major"" upgrades that changes your abilities more. Stat upgrades can be purchased at anytime and you can hold 6 at once, but Major upgrades can be purchased every few rounds (with a specific round set, depending if it's Unranked Stadium or Competitive). Though I wish I could disable the Announcer, he is a little too over-energetic.

I think I will now talk about Monetization and Cosmetics. So, as mentioned, this game is truly Free to Play (like 99%). Cosmetics are only for your customization needs, and, does not affect gameplay in any shape or form. With that said, cosmetics can be indeed quite ""pushy"", and whether you like that or not, it really goes from person to person. I suppose it's the ""price"" of Free to Play. This game have a lot of Collabs with other IPs. We have had Porsche, My Hero Academia, and even Persona. The skins are very well made, but I do believe some of them might hurt Hero Recognition (Junker Queen's Mob Boss skin is a great example). Most Heroes have very clear animation stances, posture, and particle effects, but still.

Even more surprisingly, is that the game includes Loot Boxes, but not paid ones. You can get Loot Boxes by either playing the game with Weekly Challenges, or get a couple from the Battle Pass. Yes, there is a Battle Pass, and for the Free tier, you can get a couple Loot Boxes, but there's a few more on the Premium tier. Loot Boxes can unlock items that was previously on the shop (!) as well the Battle Pass. I'm not sure if there's items that are unable to be obtained from Loot Boxes, but I have unlocked quite a few things just by playing.

Now, as any Free to Play game, this game is going to make you stick as long as possible playing. You get Daily and Weekly challenges, you get Event challenges, Hero challenges, Lifetime challenges, and so on. Each Hero has their own Progression system that, if you are one of those people who like to try 100% everything what is available for Free, well, goodluck, because it's a very long road ahead. 

I think one critic I have for the game is regards to most of the Support heroes. I feel like there's no good indicator of how much you've healed someone. Yes, there are sound effects, but I like to play while listening to music. Outside Mercy, Zenyatta and Wuyang, there's no real Heal Indicator than Health Bars on top of each one of your allies. Playing as Moira feel like I'm wasting my Heal resources without knowing for sure if an ally is fully healed. Spectator shows healthbars of both allies and enemies on top of the screen, and I feel like this could be added in-game, but only for allies. I also wish there was a small indicator if an ally's Ultimate ability is ready, as opposed in having to open the Scoreboard to check. Basically how it works with Sombra when she hacks enemies, and shows the Ultimate icon, but at all times on allies.

There's also another small critic in regards to performance once you launch the game. For some reason, the game struggles a lot on the first few minutes, so I always recommend going to Practice Range before heading to any match. Once you give it sometime, the game will run properly without any freezes or framedrops. This could be because I play windowed, but I have read online other people having the same problem. When you close the game, it can also take quite a while for the process to end completely, for some reason.

The only ""Paid"" gameplay thing is the PvE missions, which I have not played. When those missions were added to OW2, during the same day that it came to Steam, a lot of people thought PvE was gone for good, but it wasn't the case. What was removed was the Talent Tree system, where you could change the way your Hero played on PvE missions. Since then, however, it seems that we may never get any other PvE mission due to changes on the structure of the development (Microsoft acquisition) and layoffs. So I would just ignore those PvE missions, and Blizzard doesn't even try to push them anyway. It's on a very small corner on the Shop, and well, if it's fun or not, I dunno, but I heard it's kinda average and the inclusion of the Talent Tree wouldn't bring much.

All in all, I recommend this game. It has improved a lot since it was originally released: 9/10.",True,0,621

.... Now, ultimately this still smells terribly of the corpo greed that ruined what could have been the most beautiful video game of our generation.

1. Tons of characters with little world building or backstory.
2. The overarching premise appears to be missing?
3. Sound design hasn't evolved in almost a decade, including the music.
4. Old maps haven't changed much.

You may have noticed I didn't mention game mechanics or gameplay. Well, that's because it's as good as it was a DECADE ago. Which is great. But Overwatch was NEVER just about being a pure ""gameplay/mechanics"" driven game. It was about the setting, the presentation, and the characters. All of which feels shallow.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205301362,"Shocker #1: The games current state as of late 2025 is the best Overwatch has ever been in. Some people will read that and have a borderline stroke, but its the harsh truth many need to face. I've played the game since 2016, and while it may be somewhat hard to remember how it was so long ago, Team 4 have added in Overwatch Classic modes to experience what once was and while its fun taking a trip back to the past, my god has the game changed a lot for the better.

Shocker #2: Jeff Kaplan was great for his time, however the new leadership (Aaron Keller) is way better. Jeff is loved because of his very chill, down to Earth vibe. He's a great guy I'm sure, but lets not forget he was actively trying to turn Overwatch into an MMO... I'm sure that would've been super well received had we ever gotten to that point.

Shocker #3: 5v5 is the better format. I guess this comes down to personal preference, but it seems a lot of people have come around on 5v5, now that we have 6v6 in the game its fun to bounce between the two formats, fun to finally play the new tanks in a 2 tank setting, but 5v5 is still the format that is more consistent.

People are review bombing the game for many reasons, but I'd argue theres really only 2 valid reasons: PvE Cancelation and the Fortnite-ization of this game. As far as the other complaints, here are common misconceptions/reasons why the game is actually good and people are overreacting:
- 5v5 haters need to try it out again after Team 4 really refined it, it really wasn't super polished at the beginning, but after many overhauls and changes it plays so damn well. Plus if you still don't like it 6v6 is literally in the game in both Competitive and Quick Play. 
- Stadium is an actual amazing addition to the game, a new pillar to the core modes of QP and Comp. While I still personally prefer to play Comp, Stadium offers something really special
-Lootboxes are indeed back so... if you really don't want to spend a dime on this game, you can still get shop skins + old battlepass skins
-The game is surprisingly balanced, theres always going to be the people crying over how so-and-so is so OP, but what it usually comes down to is how the player uses that hero. Each hero has the potential to be ""OP""

This is still one of the best PvP shooters, and still is the best Hero Shooter by far. I would give this a solid 10/10, but theres still things I miss from OW1 that aren't present in OW2 such as portraits, end of match cards, more consistent way to earn lootboxes, Assault maps in Comp, but most of these are just cosmetic things anyway. Also I hate Fortnite.

Let me preface this by making it clear that I never played Overwatch 1.  On Steam I have 40 some odd hours, but in reality I've been playing since the launch of OW2 on Battle.NET and have logged nearly 1200 hours total.  

I get the hate at launch, the game was barebones and lacked real purpose.  I get the hate after the scrapped PVE.  After 18 seasons I've seen the game in some really horrible states, but right now?  It's actually so good.  Stadium offers variety, the perk system completely changed the flow of matches.  It's more polished and reactive than Marvel Rivals is, and that's not up for debate.  It's also incredibly well optimized.  

There's still a myriad of problems, but the core game is to a state where they seem trivial.  The monetization is kind of gross but the game is free-to-play, you don't have to engage with it if you don't want to.  In it's current state, I absolutely reccomend it.

I would like to sincerely apologize for violating the in-game code of conduct. The incident was due to a microphone malfunction on my ThinkPad laptop, which I was unaware was turned on during gameplay. My laptop is quite old and somewhat broken, and with a large family of 11 members at home, it often results in noisy audio during matches. I genuinely did not realize my microphone was active, and I deeply regret any disruption or negative impact caused.

I am a huge fan of this game, having enjoyed it since the disk version. I even purchased the Evasion Bundle and have dedicated my teenage years to playing your game since I first bought it. It truly means a lot to me, and I am very upset that my account has been banned.

I kindly ask for your understanding and a second chance to have my account reinstated.

Overwatch 2,2357570,205087508,"Three main notes:
- The game has extreme emphasis on paid, ""ultimate"" skins compared to before. You could argue it's justifiable due to the game being free, but it's not. Most of us were perfectly happy paying the base fee for the game & occasionally buying loot boxes for events. One single battle pass costs as much as many AAA-titles..
- Skins that were released in the past and gained rarity have since been re-released as a cash grab. Gross.
- Broken promises regarding story mode (see other reviews). 

I pre-ordered OW1, played for a while, and am returning now after some years. I immediately noticed the new currencies & change to the shop. I get skins from loot boxes that weren't even showing under the character before. Lots of content seems to be invisible or somehow behind paywalls. I don't understand - they reworked the old system and did it very poorly. But at least I still feel fine not pouring any further money into the game.

Regarding the lack of story content - yeah, it's shameful. Other people explain this better. I was SHOCKED to see they're charging for story DLC. Seriously? You want something like A$100 for a battle pass and some story quests? That's what I originally paid for the deluxe pre-order. Yikes.

One of these things are usually happening in at least every other match:
1) Team 1 or 2 is substantially stronger, and rolls the other. Neither is fun, or interesting because you already know the result. You're just stuck there either getting bullied or being the bully.
2) A lot of people are potato enough that they won't say hello, emote or anything, and instead grind the front door for half a minute before the match starts.
3) Someone loses their cool, and starts blaming/shaming someone else and therefore someone else gets angry and their teamwork gets derailed. 
4) Match ends and people taunt with some variation of ""ggez"", and/or someone who performed bad tries to put the blame on another.
5) You performed well, but get no endorsements because people are in a bad mood after defeat which is more often than not caused by how the matches are arranged.

Additionally you can't turn off the chat and play in peace, because then that could cause you to accidentally endorse people who are being assholes in chat. 

I reported probably 50+ people in the time I played. I could've reported more, but I gave a pass to a lot at the beginning. Anyway, I didn't get back a single message that some action was taken. Assholes and cheaters can apparently roam free for weeks without consequences, only then to probably make/use alternative accounts to play meanwhile. And what am I here anyway, unpaid and ignored QA in your storefront masquerading as a game? 

You don't have the money to fix matchmaking?
You don't have the money to fix toxicity?
Fuck off. 

I believe what they do is 100% intentional. First get you addicted, second make you feel bad so you buy some garbage skins from their store to feel good again.

And the store is on whole another level. You can use four different currencies in their store. Since Blizzard is excited for 2026, maybe they've figured out fifth so the milking can become exponentially higher. After going through all the different things and coming to a conclusion I decided to give 0€ to Blizzard.

The most irritating part is when I click on my second monitor for even a split second. The game goes black, and when it comes back, it’s usually switched back to fullscreen. This messes with my FPS, and I have to quit the game and reopen it to fix the issue. Even then, I can’t rejoin my match, which is a huge time-waster.

I’ve tried everything, changing the settings to windowed fullscreen via the Nvidia Control Panel, factory resetting my PC (I did this 2 times), and updating drivers, but nothing works.

Started on level 1, vs players that are using characters on level 40+ with hours of XP under their belt undoubtably, I just get murdered within seconds of leaving the spawn point. Some characters feel like your on one-hit-kill, but the other team needs an arsenal engaged upon them. But, it is free, so I'm glad I didn't buy it for $50. Character designs and skins are very fun, and unique. Lootboxes unlock through progression which is good, but to buy coins for the really good lookin' stuff... hope you have a second morgage. Pricing needs looking at, less is more comes to mind. $40+ to buy one skin in the Mystic store... I can buy a full game for that!

But as said, it is free, and despite the occasional drop out, and grinding to get into levels that mean you can last more than a few seconds starting out, it is a fun game. Easy to drop in/out, just very hard to 'main' a character, especially as newer ones aren't included in the League or special modes.",True,0,1274

It is a disgrace, a scam, and a betrayal rolled into one grotesque cash-hungry mess. Blizzard didn’t just drop the ball; they took the ball, spit on it, set it on fire, and lobbed it into a landfill filled with the hopes of millions of loyal fans. Every second spent in Overwatch 2 is a slap in the face — a reminder that this once-great franchise was gutted, desecrated, and taxidermied for microtransaction profit.

They promised evolution — we got degradation. They hyped a rich PvE experience — we got a soulless bait-and-switch. They took a vibrant, iconic hero shooter and stripped it of everything that made it special, replacing joy with grind, community with isolation, and purpose with profit. It's not a sequel; it's a parasite latched onto the corpse of Overwatch 1, feeding off the nostalgia of players too heartbroken to leave. The monetization is so shameless it borders on satire — $20 skins, paywalled progression, recycled events wrapped in shiny new lies. The game doesn’t even pretend to care anymore, and neither should you.

Overwatch 2 isn’t just bad — it’s the end-stage symptom of a once-great developer rotting from the inside out. It is pure, concentrated disappointment, and it deserves to be remembered not as a game, but as a warning sign: this is what happens when you let greed kill art",False,2,2121

Overwatch 2,2357570,204510384,"Well Blizzard, it has been a bumpy road. I purchased OW in 2018 because my friends were all over it and it was crossplay from Xbox to PS4 so I gave it a shot, and then unloaded my magazine. The whole dynamic changed once OW2 was released, some new friends started playing and the old ones left (6v6 should have never been removed). I remained. I remained through the lack of new content and the removal of old (battle ass), I remained through Marvel Rivals, and was beginning to think that the game was dead. I remained and even started to feel good once they added back old content like a political strategy to win players back. But the thing that took me from remaining to living was Stadium. Although it is rough around the edges and is super overstimulating when you try and bring new players into it, I love it. Or should I say loved it. One of the roughest edges is Genji, while most DPS can be out played, Genji's abilities are super frustrating to verse as a lower skill player, in a game mode where you can build around almost anyone, Genji stood out as someone who could always best you with his insane toolbox of weapons. This is due to Genji having so many movement abilities and deflecting 90% of the rosters projectiles. Moira could counter Genji in normal modes but for whatever reason in Stadium I always see Moira either trying to heal the tank or losing to the Genji. TLDR, Genji is a menace, and I (among many others) am suffering a skill issue. I could deal with this however, and still loved the game mode and it is also one hero. I also loved season 18 on launch, with numerous lootboxes and a lot more content to play towards (progression and events), I did not really care for Wuyang but he's alright (Till he got Joker's Skin, peeved about the characters they chose for that). But in the announcement trailer we got 3 new heros to Stadium, WInton (YAY), Pharah (I mean its alright), and Brig (She can be busted but just break her shield). But the last sentence sent chills down my spine ""Tracer will be added mid season"". I knew this was going to blow hard, but I could not imagine loathing a game mode that I once loved so hard, why would you not add bastion, Venture, Sym, Torb, or any other DPS. Why would you add the other stupidly annoying character and give them more to their already stupid annoying kit. It makes most matches with a Genji and Tracer unplayable, I have rarely experience negative emotions towards a game unless it deserves it (Rainbow or League) but this killed OW2 for me. 

That was a lot of background and complaining. However, complaining and not having a solution leaves you looking like a fool and while I am one for playing OW there can be a fix. My solution, add counter powers, give Sigma the ability to eat beams (not the lame does not work reduction) , give Cass the ability to shoot through shields, etc. Specifically I would like to see lore accurate powers, like Zen or Moira slowing or stunning Genji to make him easier to kill. Anything to bolster characters who have little movement abilities from getting rolled by characters that are as fast as the Flash on crack. This will make the game mode more accessible and the cancer characters less cancerous. PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS AND REMOVE POWERS IN LIEU OF THEM, JUST ADD BLIZZARD, NO DELETING.

TLDR; OW2 got it's act together (finally), Stadium is fun, Genji and Tracer are a cancer to Stadium that needs to be nerfed.  Add counter powers to specific heroes or play styles so it is more easy to master a character and not get rolled.

What changed from Overwatch 1 to 2? One less tank, MUCH bigger hitboxes from the already crazy large hitboxes in the first game, free to play, aggressive monetization, and a cancelled pve mode they promised.

The game is an unbalanced mess. Low skill ceiling heroes are rewarded more than the few high skill ceiling heroes...an interesting philosophy. You are censored from communicating with anyone in a match until Blizzard arbitrarily deems you worthy enough to communicate with your team (endorsement votes from players).

The skins are pretty good, the emotes are fun, etc. Unlike other games like Battlefront II 2017 with the crates and stuff, loot boxes in this game are pretty easy to get and pretty generous with the stuff you can get. I have a collection of skins, and I've only played this game for roughly 40 hours. Even if they're for characters you don't play, that's still a big win in my opinion. Of course, if you want specific skins, they're pretty well priced depending on which ones you want to get. Sure, some skins are like $20.00 USD, but you can also earn credits by playing the game and doing all of the battle pass stuff they give you.

seriously, this community is burning hell.
ok, so let me ""cry"" as mean players would call it.


as of now, yes, this community is incredibly toxic, so much so that recently, i've found myself being frustrated more and more as i engage with the game & turn my chat on more to call out someone kindly or agressively. depends on how irritating the match and the players behavior is. situations where enemies are hunting me down or especially if teammates throw games on purpose, derank.. or the enemies have booster players, heck even outright smurf accounts at action.

i'll probably get chat banned at least in near future. which will be another reason for me to hate, because i keep reporting users with obscene language: no response message pop-up after logging in if my report was acted upon. 
i report them for throwing games and maybe them even admitting doing such things: no response message.. you get the point. i'm terribly disgusted how people get away and i just... feel like i will not! 
see, i do have short-temper on my own, but this one heck of a game has pushed it further.

anyway, i just can't take people going for each other's throat on this game & the constant push of me to feel the same way.
if i would proceed to another game, hoping that'll be any better but people are still griefing, throwing and being toxic, i can't hold myself back. i have tried sending friend invites to mean people (or when i was being mean/rude too to ask them about their problem, or say why i did this and that, don't just blame me for something at least). most of them rejected obviously. some came asking what do i want to cry about. some were pretty much ok, or just brushed it all off.

on the other hand, the game mechanics are fun and the some of the cosmetics are quite nice. that is, they're not scamming people with weird discounts and prices for skins that don't even have anything extra for them, like a voiceline, while other skins for the same price legendary skin have unique voicelines.

i might not make sense here, so let's just take widowmaker's medusa and dokiwatch/hollow heart skin. medusa's got voicelines and i think sometimes she says ""thanksss"", so hissing. while dokiwatch is just.. there it is. quite pretty i guess... isn't she?! that's it.


oh and i changed my girly name joke to a more unisex one, just to avoid weird people or bullies more.

if you were kind enough to suffer through this, first of all, thank you and let me tell you not to believe i literally have 1.2k hours playing matches! it's actually around 550 hours playtime and i've been on it for a year and a few months plus.

i am not double-checking what i wrote, sorry for any grammar..hiccups? mistakes.

Overwatch 2,2357570,204264371,"Since the update adding stadium to overwatch 2, it has become a mess. I have a 13th gen intel I7 processor and it was running overwatch perfectly fine and I quite liked this game. Came back to it after a couple of months away, tried to play it, tried the new stadium mode, my PC crashed after 2 mins, updated GPU and BIOS drivers to the latest versions, restarted, and tried again, it crashed after 11 minutes.

I've seen a bunch of very intricate ""fixes"" for this online that have yielded very mixed results, so the takeaway from this is - don't play this game if you have a 13th or 14th gen intel processor, it will freeze and crash repeatedly. Blizzard are doing absolutely nothing to remedy this, so to save my system (which is barely 1 year old BTW) I am deleting overwatch 2 and I recommend others running the same processor do the same until blizzard gets their fingers out of their behind, and actually fix this.

Overwatch 2,2357570,204255229,"Overwatch 2 will likely never recover from it's botched release, the failed attempt at a campaign, and rather meh first couple of years, but, for the past 10 months the game has been pumping out new, high quality content every new season. The devs have regularly shifted around who is and is not strong at any given time, and the overall game is incredibly balanced (even if metal rank players might disagree, citing moira and junkrat of all characters as busted).

The main complaint people seem to have nowadays is the pricing and distribution of cosmetics, which while valid, honestly is pretty minor, and just shows how far the game has come.

Yeah yeah, the community could be nicer but if you don't want to, you can opt out of seeing or hearing any of their messages. And sure all have a couple of handful of heroes whom we do not like, and in NA and Europe you can get chatbanned for saying gl hf and gg too much (happened to me), but the game, frankly, is in the best state it has ever been. Most of my rounds are exciting and fun, people are actually quite decent on average, and there's a million different ways to approach the 40 or so characters which keeps things fresh even if you like me decide to only play two or three of them.

If you like slightly silly but extremely compettiive hero shooters, this is your game, there is no better alternative. If you liked the game back when everyone played it, you should give it a shot, relearn it, and have some fun with your friends.",True,4,45256
