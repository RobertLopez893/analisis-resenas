The overall flow of the matches feels clean and well‑structured, and the maps so far feel better designed than most of what I had in BO6. I’m still early on so I can’t judge long‑term balance, but for now the pacing, movement and gunplay are all satisfying enough to keep me queuing for ‘one more game’.

On PC, the technical performance is clearly better than BO6 by a good margin for me: framerate is more stable, the game feels more responsive, and I haven’t run into any serious technical issues yet.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209900908,"This franchise has already been going downhill for many years at this point, but what I didn’t expect was for them to reach a new level of low. An unreachable level of low that I thought wouldn’t be attainable by any game developers. I’ve honestly never seen a piece of media this bad. I’ve seen 42cent hentai games with more value and better gameplay than the recent Call of Duty titles. I don’t know what happened to COD. It looks like they saw the success of Fortnite and tried to copy it, but failed miserably. And if you still think COD is good… that’s a sign of denial.
First, the COD launcher is miserable in every way. It takes a PhD to navigate the menus every time I want to play. The game restarts three times before putting me in a lobby. There are useless game modes. It “installs shaders” for 10 minutes every time I launch it. The optimization is terrible. It’s always online with no offline mode. There’s an 80 GB update every two weeks. Worst graphic every new release. Fake promises, 93 CAD$ for DLCs… and much more. I didn’t even know a new COD was released until I saw a video titled “Black Ops 7 is Embarrassing”, which it is. Actually, BO7 is more than embarrassing. Like I said, it’s the most utter piece of garbage I’ve seen. Let’s start with this: the game was made with AI. Let’s not sugarcoat it. We know for a fact that the entire art used in the game, especially in multiplayer, was made with AI. Pretty shameful for a game that supposedly took years to develop and had thousands of employees on the project. And I don’t think it’s just the art, it feels like the entire game. This includes multiplayer and definitely the campaign. And they want me to pay 93 CAD$ for that? Lmfao.

Concerning the multiplayer: the franchise hasn’t had actual new content since Modern Warfare 2019 (the reboot), which was more than six years ago. In 2019 they added new movements, graphics, maps, mechanics, new modes, rebooted the MW series, and more. After 2019, they haven’t added a single new thing. They just take the same formula from 2019 and copy-paste it each year, changing absolutely nothing except reskinning old maps and weapons. Then they slap a new number on the box to pump out quick cash. Let’s not forget they promised the original MW2 maps in the 2022 reboot and didn’t deliver. If you want to play them, you have to pay 93 CAD$ for a DLC. Call of Duty was supposed to be a military arcade shooter. Nowadays you see Nicki Minaj slide cancelling across the map. Like what is this? Fortnite? By the way, I bought the Snoop Dogg bundle back in Warzone 1, and when they switched to Warzone 2 they deleted all the skins. Thanks, Infinity Scam! And that brings me to the elephant in the room: Warzone. Why does everything have to be tied to your trash battle royale? The campaign is related, the multiplayer is related, even zombies is related. Why? Oh, right. Money...

As for the campaign, it used to be about military operations, like Black Ops, which focused on missions with high levels of secrecy. Now we have Call of Dookie: Skibidi Toilet 7, where the protagonist is on the world’s biggest acid trip. How much acid did yall take? In the past we had black-ops missions; now we have openly taking acid, zombies fighting on your side, and giant hallucinations straight out of Skibidi Toilet. Jesus. Black Ops 7 is making COD Vanguard look like a saint. BO7 aside, MW2019, MW2022, and Black Ops Cold War were all solid campaigns.

Main Problems with Warzone on Steam (2025)

Poor Performance / Low FPS

Many Steam users say their frame rates are significantly worse than on other launchers (Battle.net or Xbox app). 
VideoGamer
+1

Some players report stuttering or framedrops, especially since more recent season updates. 
Reddit
+2
Reddit
+2

Example: one user says even with all graphics settings on lowest, they can't get more than ~60 FPS. 
Reddit

Crashing / Launch Failures

Several reports of Warzone not launching on Steam: game freezes or crashes immediately. 
Reddit
+2
Reddit
+2

Specific error mentioned: 0x00001338 when trying to start the game. 
Reddit

Activision’s support suggests verifying game files via Steam can help. 
Activision Support
+1

Some Redditors say disabling Xbox Game Bar / overlay helps: one user fixed launch issues by disabling recording via Xbox Game Bar. 
Reddit

Input / Stutter / “Gun Stuttering”

There are reports of input stuttering during gunfights: the weapon fires a few bullets, pauses, fires again, etc. 
Reddit

This kind of stutter is especially harmful in a fast-paced shooter like Warzone, where burst shots or automatic fire are common.

Server / Network Issues

Activision has publicly acknowledged “server stability, packet loss, and lobby crashing” as ongoing issues. 
Call of Duty

Connection problems can lead to lag, jitter, or disconnections. Some of this might be mitigated by optimizing your network (wired connection, checking router settings). 
netduma.com

Known Hardware / OS Crashes

According to Activision’s known issues page, there’s a bug causing crashes on PC for players using certain AMD Radeon RX 400 / 500 GPUs on newer Windows versions (Windows 11 24H2 / 25H2). 
Activision Support

This means some crashes aren’t just random — they’re linked to specific hardware + OS combos.

Large & Confusing Download Size

Some players report that the Steam version is confusing in terms of how much has been installed. One user said they downloaded ~19GB first, then a second ~60GB download started. 
Reddit

This suggests either poor installer design or unclear requirements, which can lead to wasted time or install errors.

Use of AI in Game Content

There’s a more subtle, non-technical issue also being raised: Activision has disclosed on its Steam pages that some in-game assets were made (or helped) using generative AI. 
Business Insider

For some players, this raises concerns about quality, “rushed” content, or a lack of polish.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209868829,"After spending days reading countless reviews on YouTube, Twitter, Reddit and everywhere else, I still decided to give the game a fair shot, knowing a lot of people purposely drop negative takes just for clicks.

You’re forced to log in with your useless Activision Account whenm you start the game for the first time and you always get dumped into that Netflix-Style menu where you have to pick which CoD or Warzone you want to launch and of course there are already tons of operator skins and weapon bundles for real money. Since I can't stand those animated, neon-bright skins or goofy tracer bullets, the shop has been irrelevant to me for years anyway.

Multiplayer;
The maps are mostly solid, especially the BO2 remakes and the guns feel great with really nice feedback and hitmarkers… at least on the rare occasions where the lag-compensation, netcode, and random delays actually let them register. The killstreaks are actually nice.
SBMM is slightly less aggressive than before, but let’s not lie… it’s still a sweat-fest. The netcode feels wrong half the time. Shots don’t register, random delays and you get you killed in fights you should’ve won...
There’s also this weird ADS bug where your aim jumps or shifts during auto-fire. No clue if it’s intended or just another bug.
The prestige system is awful imo. You just slide through levels with constant pop-ups and zero sense of reward. I miss the MW2 / BO1 / BO2 prestige days so badly.
On top of that, the whole game looks like a bright plastic dollhouse again. Why Treyarch keeps forcing this rainbow BO-Style visual theme is beyond me. It gives me eye cancer every single time.
I guess it’s okay, definitely better than Black Ops 6, but nowhere near the OG CoDs.

Campaign;
Co-op campaign and the ''endgame'' are a joke. Absolute trash!
The only good part? The slight nostalgia hits from Woods, Mason, Menendez, and the little Vorkuta Mission. Real Black Ops OGs will know exactly which mission I mean. ;p 
But overall… yeah, trash.

Zombies;
Zombies gives a bit of BO2 Tranzit Vibe, especially with the little jeep you can drive around. But the map is way too open and way too big. You just drive from one tiny village to the next, each with like one or two perk machines, do a couple of tasks, and that’s it. Most of the time it just feels empty because the area is so huge.
Zombie hits have a noticeable delay too. You can slide away, be 5 meters out, but the game still decides the hit should count. Classic Activision trash servers.
Perks are fine, new power-ups are actually kinda cool, Pack-a-Punch is the same as the last few Years, nothing groundbreaking. The perk-upgrade system is idk .. bad, imo. Cold War did it so much better.

If you're here for that classic Black Ops magic, a good campaign, and a satisfying multiplayer, you won’t find it. If you're here for Zombies, you’ll have a good time, mostly. Everything else? Most of it is pretty bad. No Love, No Soul. Just a fast Cash-Cow imo.",False,26,491

Sure there is bits and pieces of memories from the previous game, but i feel we were all looking forward to a better played out story with the return of Menendez, not the guild bs with all the hallucinations and a continuation of the black ops 6 story which should not be as relevant as it is in the BO7 campaign (BO6 WAS CIA AND FOLLOWED BO1, NOT MILITARY BASED!!). And don't even get me started on the Warzone based Co-Op campaign, this idea was trash and hated by so many people so why would they bring it back and think its a great idea, BECAUSE ITS NOT!!! Also for the fact of i didn't know if it was more campaign or zombies as i played through it. If i wanted to play zombies (which i usually do) ILL GO PLAY THE GAMEMODE FOR IT!!! I feel like i can speak for everyone and say this was a waste of 70-100 dollars, and they could have done a much better job on the game than what they did. And i've said it before and ill say it again, IF YOUR CHARGING 100 PER GAME, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS FIX THE BUGS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM SINCE MODERN WARFARE 2!!!!! Ill also be honest and say i have not played the multiplayer mode yet, but i have seen the new maps and I'm excited for those, and i have no complaints about the new weapons or operators, but come onnnnnn the base game could have been way better than what it is now, and that's what every player will focus on.",False,0,20964

- No. I didn't break the rules. I guess spending time with your partner grinding CoD zombies is reason to get a shadow. Good job, Activision.
My review below has not changed. We shall see how Call of Duty handles this BS.
So, here it is:
 * I like the zombies. I'm basically going from bo3 to this and its fun, I like the maps, etc. It feels good and i'm hopeful they continue that. I never really played CoD for anything except Zombies and if thats you, then buy the game find out if its worth the money for your enjoyment & time, and if not refund it within the period for Steam. In my case, I feel its worthwhile.

* Campaign was fun to do with my partner. To be clear, fun =/= good campaign. For those who can't read, =/= means ""does not equal."" (:

* Multiplayer: I don't care I'll try it eventually. I'm a zombies player I really do not care about that very much.

No, it's not because of the campaign. Or the obvious use of AI. Its a bit more internal than that. 

Simple fact is, if you're a good player, not even a great or even above average, just good player? You're bound to get shadow banned due to the necking of SBMM. Being put in a lobby with players who don't play as much as you do, you end up doing well?

Guess what, Tommy didn't like that, he's gonna spam report you and you're unable to play for a whole week if you're lucky. It's utter bull-crap, and the fact they rely so heavily on AI to detect these false flags, means more often than not you're nerfing yourself so you don't get booted off the game for a small period of time.

Seriously, Campaign: Likely Chat GPT, cause any human who wrote that should be embarrassed and black listed. the weapon camo's the calling cards, the store blue prints, all AI slop with minimal human review and editing.  even the level color palette changes are so frequent they induce headaches was obviously directed by AI with no human review worthwhile from the QA team. 

this campaign, at least in the first ""chapter"", has Mason as a dollar tree Bruce Wayne/ Batman  with daddy issues  in a penny store scarecrow story line.  it's not mind bending by any stretch of the word, it's mind NUMBING slop. 

releasing competition to Skibidi Toilet in game form should never be acceptable.


Multiplayer:  Same shit as always, infested with participation trophies losers who think buying cheats is a skill ( google searching for cheats isn't a skill FYI) and who think the monetary transaction means they ""bought skill"" so now they think THEY have skill when they don't they have software, and paid 70 USD for a game plus  10-70 USD a month, so their PC can play the game for them with little assistance outside of ""ADS"" and ""Shoot"", making it more like an interactive storyline game with no story rather then a competitive shooter for them.   The rest of the legit community hates you and wishes all the bad things happen to you. 

as for activision, TPM 2.0 and secure boot obviously didn't do shit. congrats, you made installing and playing a game a pain in the ass for anyone non-PC literate a massive hassle for no reason.

I bought BO7 specifically because they promised open matchmaking with minimal SBMM. And for the first week, it actually felt that way — fun, relaxed, mixed-skill lobbies.

But as of 21/11, something clearly changed. Matchmaking is now completely different:

I constantly join matches already in progress and usually already lost.

Every lobby is full of prestige 4–8 stacks on the enemy team.

My team goes 10–30 while the other side farms streaks.

If you’re a good player, the game silently punishes you with sweatier and sweatier lobbies.

This is NOT what was advertised. It feels like stealth SBMM was turned back on, and it ruins the experience. I've been playing Call of Duty since CoD4 and I’ve never seen the series ignore its players like this.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209751556,"Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is probably the most disappointed I've been in a COD game. I'm going to split this review into sections so that it's easier to read.

Campaign

Let me keep this short. This is the worst campaign since BO3. The story focuses to much on the Cradle to create psychedelic experiences. This is the majority of the campaign. 

SPOLIER WARNING HERE! 

It disrespects BOII, and de-canonizes parts of it. For those who may not remember, either Harper or Karma has to die. If you save Harper in BOII, Farid is killed, thus Karma is killed by Salazar. If you kill Harper, Karma is saved because Farid takes the hit for her. So what I want to know is, how are they both alive. There's missions referencing BOII, and there are constant call backs to it, but this plot hole is not ok. The only way I can make sense of it, is that the bullet that hits Karma didn't actually kill her, and she survived, that's all I got, and I feel like I'm grasping at straws.

SPOLIER OVER!

Another issue with campaign is that it's co-op only, and if you try to play alone, your character will be there, but your squad mates will not. Your squad mates will still talk to you, but they're nowhere to be seen if you play alone. This goes for co-op too, if you don't have four people in a lobby, a character will be missing, but will appear in cutscenes, and speak as if they are actually there. This is extremely jarring to say the least. The only good thing to come out of the campaign this year is the cross weapon progression, that's really it. I didn't care for Endgame as it's just not for me. Overall, Campaign is a complete waste of time.

Multiplayer

Multiplayer is fun for the most part, but I can't help feeling some of the changes made negatively impact the experience. Auto Aim has been so nerfed it can be hard to line up shots a lot of the time (This is getting buffed in the season 1 update). Right now though I feel like controller is at a major disadvantage. I do agree that Aim Assist is the weakest it's been in the franchise, which means that as always, keyboard and mouse have a major advantage. Did it need a nerf last year, sure I can't argue that, but this was way to much. Another issue is the matchmaking. I get people are excited that it's open now, but for me this has really hurt my experience. As a person with low vision and CP, my reaction and reflexes are slower, SBMM helped in this area because I could play with those who were of similar skill level, allowing me to contribute to my team. Before anyone says it in the comments, yes there is a standard matchmaking option, but it's clear it's going to be secondary to open matchmaking. More specifically they just added the Nuketown playlist to open, but standard is still just core moshpit. This is an issue because while Nuketown will appear in the map rotation, it isn't a playlist we can select in standard matchmaking. This means that anyone who wants SBMM for a more even playing field won't get it. For me personally, that means I won't be able to help my team and that just hurts. I'm glad both playlists are there, but standard needs love too. Why can't Nuketown 24/7 be in both playlists? It just doesn't make sense to me. I also am not really enjoying the weapon camo grind. Getting to prestige master for me hasn't been the best experience, partly because of what I mentioned above. I know this could change with some updates, but right now I can't say I've enjoyed the multiplayer to it's fullest, physically because I can't.

Zombies

I'm not much of a zombies player anymore, but I'm glad survival is back. I fell in love with zombies because it was about getting to as high of a round as you could. I don't enjoy the standard, or even directed mode. I miss the days where it was just kill zombies. What I will say though is the power situation in solo play is not great. If you play solo you have to shoot the skulls to destroy them, then you can turn on the power. I find this to not be very fun, and I feel it just adds needless filler to what your trying to do. It's fine in a group, but for solo it really has got to go. I do enjoy the map however as it does remind me of farm from BOII. That's all I really have to say on zombies. Like i said not much of a zombies player anymore.

Conclusion

BO7 has a lot of fun ideas. It's great to see BO2 characters again like David and Harper. The campaign is completely not worth anything, I believe it shouldn't even be cannon, it makes no sense, and the forced co-op takes away from what a campaign is. It could be remedied by allowing us to play with bots, but who knows if that will happen. Not to mention needing to always be online is just not ok.

Multiplayer is fun, but them not updating the standard playlist saddens me. I'm glad it's open for those who want it open, but I feel like people like me are going to struggle this year because of factors out of our control. I don't write about my disabilities for pity, but I want to stress the point that SBMM helped me play too. I know standard exists, but it's clear it won't be getting the new playlists like open will. (Hope I'm wrong on this in the future).

Zombies is fun, but I feel some changes need to be made for it to be more enjoyable across the board. (Zombies is also getting some changes in the season 1 update).

There's my thoughts on the game as a whole.

I WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW IF THINGS CHANGE!

It is surprisingly really well done and for the first time in a long time, I am having fun in a Call of Duty title. It is definitely not BO2, but it does have the BO2 aesthetic and I honestly love that. 

The omni-movement is cool with being able to sprint in any direction. I still think the tactical slide is too fast and do not like how fast people are able to zip around the map, but I personally am able to overlook it. The wall bounce isn't too crazy. Nothing bad to really say about it. 

With SBMM being removed, I don't feel like I have to put a sweat band on and gear up for the COD Olympics every time I press ""Find Match"". I am actually dropping kills and having a great time. Some games I fry, some games I get fried. 

TTK feels good. I feel comfortable taking 1vX fights and winning them. With that being said, gunplay also feels good and feels smooth. 

Again, I was very against purchasing another Call of Duty and had already planned on playing Battlefield 6 to get my fill of a competitive shooter, but I am actually glad I bought this game. Overall I give the multiplayer a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I just hope the game will stay level and not go crazy with skins, tracers, and operators. Keep bringing COD back to a level ground and stay away from the Fortnite BS.

The multiplayer gameplay in isolation is actually not bad at all, the guns are good to use and they made the killstreaks meaningful again. What I am utterly appalled by is the claim they made about SBMM being off, turning it off in the beta, using it as a selling point to get people to buy the game, and then simply bringing it back. First few games were amazing, I was so relieved and had so much fun, I was holding a 2-2.5 elim/death ratio, and then it happened. Sweat lobby after sweat lobby, I would leave games and continuously be put back in the same sweaty games I just left, I'm starting to see familiar names, SBMM is literally the same as the last 5. Every player is prestige 2+ in my games, I join midway into games where other team is in a party of 4-6 streaking against solo players. The only difference I observe is that in every game there is at least one player on the team who is hard negative, so it seems the kept SBMM for the most part, but introduce one bad player to make you feel less shit about the game. SBMM is a plague on COD and destroys the experience of open matchmaking. Make regular matchmaking ping based matchmaking like it used to be and make ranked skill based, its simple?

Literally can't even leave spawn without getting killed by the same garbage player that has no pride or integrity and the morons who made this game just allow it and build maps that cater to it.  

Summary:
The poor map design promotes and rewards spawn killing, hit detection is terrible, random disconnects, lag is too noticeable, not enough options for multiplayer, and campaign is dumb.  And if that isn't enough the game has DirectX issues that have existed since MW3 that haven't been fixed.  So a Microsoft owned game utilizing Microsoft DirectX running on a Microsoft OS locks up the game and since it's all online you lose your progress (just happened to me on the last boss of the campaign).

Leveling weapons feels rewarding because all weapons are balanced at the moment. Havent tried Zombies yet, pretty sure ive read alot of positive comments.

To be honest, I bought this for the nostalgia, I played Cod since Call of Duty 3, this might not be the best game of all but only playing it takes me back several years.

Even from that fresh perspective, the balance in this game is just terrible.

Enemies constantly spawn behind you, sometimes literally 5 meters away. It doesn’t feel fair or skill-based, it just feels cheap.

Matchmaking is a disaster. You either stomp or get stomped, with very little in between. It often feels like the game throws you into completely random lobbies instead of anything based on skill.

Hit detection / netcode is irritating. In some replays you can clearly see bullets going straight through enemies without doing any damage. I even had a rocket launcher shot pass through someone without taking any damage. That kind of thing completely kills the fun.

To be fair, performance is good, and Zombies is actually pretty fun. Those parts show that there is a good game hiding in here somewhere.

But my big question is: how can Call of Duty, after so many games, still release something with balancing this bad? It feels like they haven’t learned anything from previous titles.

I’ll keep playing for now because some of my friends are on it, but at this moment I wouldn’t recommend Black Ops 7 at all. You’re better off buying Black Ops 6 or even Battlefield instead.

Campaign: Call of duty can't make a story without the premise being about a missile, or a mind numbing schizophrenia chemical agent... The ONLY GOOD MISSION was that one mission on hijacked. Activision can only make the most generic military story, or the most bat shi crazy story in this modern era of gaming. The only good thing that made this campaign playable was the CO-OP mechanic. 3/10 

ZOMBIES: I actually love Zombies. Ashes of the Damned is the best zombies map we have had in this modern formula of COD Zombies. The Easter Egg is so thoughtfully written out and everything feels cohesive. The map is beautiful with the skybox and lighting. The OG characters bring back so much Charm that was missing in BO6. Zombies seems to be getting a lot of content with Cursed Mode. Survival. and Dead Ops Arcade. Dead Ops Arcade has always been fun and I am glad that they kept up the good work with Dead Ops Arcade 4. 8/10! :)

Multiplayer: Welp, I really don't like multiplayer. Bland guns, bland maps, everything feels the exact same but with a futuristic skin on. I just don't find myself enjoying the multiplayer. Everything feels the exact same from BO6. The movement has gotten arguably worse with the addition of wall hopping. It's another lazy attempt to bring some variety in a franchise that needs it desperately. 4/10

Overall: This Call of Duty is yet another one hit wonder where the only thing that feels handcrafted and not soulless is the zombies. With the additional use of AI art, this game feels lacking of any emotion. I have had tons of fun with the zombies but literally everything else about this game is terrible.

Zombies: It's COD Zombies, it is ok, I had my fun.

Multiplayer: It is the same COD Multiplayer from a decade ago with a fresh paint. If you know what to expect and want more of the same, by all means go ahead and play.

Campaign: Atrocious, commits the WORST sin a COD campaign could make; to be fucking boring. No reason for it to be co-op. It feels less like a campaign and more like a glorified Special Ops game mode. In fact it IS a Special Ops trying to deceive us all. Boring, unimpactful, mediocre, uncaring, LACKING BASIC FEATURES.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209525692,"In this Review, all I'm going to do is copy/paste my successful Refund Request with an estimated 10-14h gametime with Black Ops 7. 

""Starting this off, surely looking off my library you can see I'm a CoD Fan. Been playing basically every year for many many years by now, but I think I need to take a step back and maybe leave CoD alone for a while.

Learning of the heavily AI-generated content I'm being sold alongside the entirety of the Campaign (Honestly half the reason I ever buy a CoD, the other half is Multiplayer) had me saying words I've never uttered aloud while holding my head. ""What the fuck is this writing? What?"" The entire campaign is just, awful, and the Endgame game mode is stuck behind completing it. Cool in WAW more than a decade ago for something genuinely new, not nowadays with it being Black Ops DMZ; especially with such a shit campaign. I do not say that lightly; I know everyone's been dogging on it. It's warranted.

The Zombies? I'm not playing it; it's just BO6 Zombies and I didn't even play that. Of course I won't touch that shit. 

I know I dumped at least like 17 hours into BO7 by now alongside getting two guns to Shattered Gold, but I'm really just, regretting my purchase with it. Maybe if it went on an extreme sale, but it is far under my expectations for a at-the-end-of-the-day multi-trillion dollar company. I'm sure I'll get that itch for this game specifically after playing it here and there, but not an itch worth $70. I didn't think I'd spend $70 on a game in which I would play only 1 of the 3 whole experiences they give when I've played everything every year. I didn't wanna be a Battlefield man, but the fates call my name. 

If I can't get a refund, I kinda understand, but at least you'd know I regret my purchase; oh and I'll likely be vocal and summarize what I said here in a review in it. Thank you Steam Reviewer #8008135.""",False,1,75000

I'm tired of Activision just butt diddling everyone with a new game and calling it ""REVOLUTIONAZING!"", while selling us the same slop

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209522777,"Call of Duty Black Ops 7....  

The campaign is a absolute dumpster Fire. 

The BO7 campaign is so bad it feels like it was written during a power outage using crayons. The story makes no sense. Every mission feels like a random TikTok edit glued together. Characters talk like they’re reading scripts they saw for the first time that same morning.

The bosses? Bullet sponges from hell. You could empty 12 magazines into one guy and he’s still alive giving speeches like he’s running for president. And the plot… bro. The plot is so confusing I needed a therapist after Mission 3. It’s not bad in a funny way. It’s bad in a “did I just waste hours of my life?” way.

Multiplayer is straight up unplayable comedy.

Multiplayer feels like the devs had a bet to see who could make the worst experience. The guns are either kill in one accidental hipfire, or take 30 bullets and a blood sacrifice. The spawns are so awful you’ll respawn directly inside somebody’s crosshair, like the game wants you to suffer. The maps look like someone typed “generic FPS level” into an AI and pressed enter.

The time to kill? Horrible. The footsteps? oh boi. The UI? Looks like a mobile game from 2014. Every match feels like you’re fighting the game more than the players.


Zombies is… okay.

Not amazing, not special, its zombies. It’s like a decent microwave meal you don’t love it, but you’ll eat it. The farm map. Too small but fun. Other maps... Hope we get some DLC maps to save it. The guns are usable. Got the ray gun!

The mode doesn’t actively try to ruin your life. It’s the only mode where the game feels like it remembered it’s supposed to be fun. Not great, not iconic just barely keeping BO7 from being a crime.

What really stings is I was actually hyped. A BO2 sequel? I thought we were finally getting a real comeback. Instead BO7 slid in. Stabbed me in the leg. Then the shoulder. Then grabbed a gun and shot me. (If you get the reference. You a real one.)",True,2,517

Far and away better than Battlefield 6 - your bullets actually hit your target and do damage. No hit registration issues.

The downside for new players and casual players is there is no SBMM. Removing it was a huge mistake. This will be reflected a HUGE plummet in player numbers as the majority market stops logging in.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209450788,"1/10 - Absolute Trash, AI Slop Disgrace, Zombies is a Total Joke
I've been a COD fan since the original Black Ops, but Black Ops 7 is hands-down the WORST Call of Duty game ever made. They cheaped out HARD by stuffing the game with obvious AI-generated garbage – calling cards, prestige icons, posters, you name it. It's all that soulless, blurry Studio Ghibli rip-off slop that screams ""we couldn't be bothered to hire real artists."" Activision even admits on the Steam page they used ""generative AI tools"" for assets, and it shows – lazy, low-effort crap in a $70 AAA title that rakes in billions. This isn't innovation; it's cutting corners to fund more battle passes.
Multiplayer? Recycled BO6 slop with worse TTK, laggy servers, and aim assist on steroids. Campaign? An unpausable, always-online co-op mess that's basically DMZ/Zombies fever dream – giant machetes from the sky, skibidi toilet bosses, zero checkpoints. It's like AI wrote the script too.
And Zombies? What a JOKE. Feels like BO6.5 with frustrating randoms, health-bar zombies jumping from nowhere, pointless vehicles, and Pack-a-Punch that's always there but guns still feel like wet noodles past round 30. No soul, no thrill – just a points grind that punishes solo play.
Boycott this AI-fueled dumpster fire. Treyarch and Activision killed the franchise. Refunding and moving to Battlefield.
(I let Grok AI make this review since there game is made with AI. No I did not mention anything about Battlefield to it but I agree.)

I can say without a doubt I didn't like the first mission of the campaign. Then I kept playing and realized that it was 11 copy pastes of the same thing. Why was there zombies in the campaign? I love zombies and I usually love Call of Duty Campaigns but this game feels like if you took all the good parts of a Call of Duty and shoved them into a blender until all the parts are so mixed up that none are definitively recognizable. The campaign is online only, and there's zombies. 
Pros for BO7
- You can level in all three big modes and you unlock stuff for each.
- Looks pretty solid
- Movement is nice with the omni directional stuff.
- Cool to see all the Black Ops Stories come to tie in a little

Cons for BO7
- Awful writing for the campaign, I know it's a shooter game so i should just shoot stuff and be happy, but why did we even do all that? The bad people are bad? Ok...? but what did they do other than tell everyone governments are bad?
- Super repetitive gameplay, all the missions have a boss fight that is basically gimic... shoot... wait... repeat. It didn't do anything new or inventive. 
- You couldn't change the difficulty. Me and my brother played the campaign together which was so fun to be able to do... but it was painfully, annoyingly, mind-numbingly easy. There was ammo and sheilds everywhere, you didn't at any point need to be smart. We literally stopped using guns unless for the bosses because to make it an actual challenge we decided to do knives only. If i can basically non-stop tac sprint around directly from one enemy to the next using only a knife, something is wrong. As someone who loved grinding out the WW2 Veteran difficulty and dying over and over and having to use strategy and think of how to use and not use my ammo, it was super frustrating that I didn't need to do that here, but more so that it wasn't even an option. Also when you kill someone they don't drop their gun which is sooooooooo dumb.

In conclusion I was so excited to be a Black Ops operator again and do shady stuff that's morally questionable to ""make the world a better place"" but it just wasn't there. It was flat characters shooting at npc's that give a clear reason why most where traded out for robots by the time you get to BO3. I love Call of Duty and that's why I felt sick knowing how excited I was for this and then seeing it in action.

The multiplayer was pretty cool and I'm excited for zombies but as someone who doesn't just love Call of Duty for the guns and explosions this game is garbage. I prolly won't get the next one when it comes out.

I haven't played Battle field but when I saw the videos of people playing that I thought dang, Activision has a lot to try to amout to with this one, I guess I should have just taken a hint back when those rapper skins first dropped in MW because since then I think Activision has been actively in the game only for the money and it shows.",False,0,23499

Movement itself is fine, but the speed and excessive head-bobbing make gunfights feel chaotic. Good luck winning engagements unless you’re using an SMG; once again, they’re laser-accurate bullet hoses with absurd stopping power.

Zombies is passable, basically on the same level as Black Ops 6. The campaign, however, feels like an afterthought. It barely seems worth having, unless you enjoy shooting oversized enemies that vomit on you and react like someone playing peekaboo with a toddler.

The art work looks like AI slop.

In Multiplayer, the game suffers from the same problem Black Ops 4 had, where everyone hates pretty much all of the new maps so the game relies heavily on old maps from the original Black Ops.

Look up any video online about the campaign, boss fights look like something out of Borderlands, giant monster humans that attack you, I mean like 50 feet tall, completely absurd.

1 zombies map, cause god knows they put so much effort into that ONE map.


When the high point of a Call of Duty game is Dead Ops Arcade you know there's a problem.  EVEN with that you have to manually change the setting for your aim mode from mouse to controller for you to be able to aim in Dead Ops Arcade.  So you have to manually switch input aim settings when you rotate from a controller to keyboard and mouse, which as everyone knows FPS is better on keyboard and mouse, and Dead Ops Arcade is a damn twin stick shooter.

The SBMM feels less punishing, and the current content volume, weapon quality, and map quality all feel solid overall. Compared to BO6, BO7 is a significant improvement, and it feels like the developers have changed. But looking around, it's constantly being compared to BF6, and the internet is flooded with negative reviews and critical comments. Reading this is surprising. Times change, and while the past might have been better, I don't think it's good to cling too tightly to it.

Refunded it and decided to try BO7, even though almost everyone had a negative attitude toward it. Reviews, Youtubers, and such.

Fortunately, It turned out to be a great game. It runs well, plays great, and I genuinely enjoyed the campaign. Despite all the hate, the story kept me engaged. It’s a game, so it gets silly sometimes, and that’s perfectly fine. The boss fights were a bold move and surprisingly well executed. They reminded me of classic single player shooters from the 2010s.
Multiplayer is the main reason people buy Call of Duty, and this one delivers. Matchmaking is fast, lobbies are active, and the maps are a big improvement over BO6. Zombies also brings back that nostalgic fun. I had a great time with it.

So, If you're like me and was struggling to enjoy a call of duty game in the past years, then I recommend you give this one a real shot. It's one of the good ones.

Campaign: WTF/10 
-Some Awesome Moments
-Some Platforming Required (not so bad, augements are there for you)
-Some Throwback moments (To Black Ops 2 and 1 THE GOATS)
-Some Good Augments (not game breaking)
-Some BS plot and WTF continuity issues here and there (WONT SPOIL)
-Spongy Enemies (Annoying as HELL)
-Upgrade Rate SLOW AS HELL (Also Annoying)
-For a second COD game with a Cooperative Campaign, Solo or with idiots Makes no Difference story is the same shit.
-Final mission turns into a DMZ/MW3 Zombies wannabe 
-Only Campaign that levels you and guns Up no need for MP or Zombies or Warzone

MULTIPLAYER (Shield your christian eyes... if you have any) FUCKSHITSTICK/10
-SSDG (SAME SHIT DIFFERENT GAME)
-Attachment Hell as per usual (innovation is not Activision's Forte)
-Latin American servers as per usual are SHIT (thank you activision you racist asswipes) 100+Latency no matter the gamemode
-Same Gamemodes as BO6 (as i said innovation is not Activision's Forte)
-New Game Mode Disruption or whatever the fuck its called... gridiron but with EMP devices and more tryhardism
-Going back to latency issues Motherfuckers see me lightyears before i can see them and everyone is using the Maverick 9... annoying 3 burst bullshit, once again youtubers are taking everyones chance to be Creative with guns and attachments.
-Played 3 games and got bored and uninstalled it... cause its just not worth it BATTLEFIELD 6 is TEARING YOU APART COD WAKE THE FUCK UP AND DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209329199,"After playing another extraction shooter that just came out and then coming to this game, BO7 feels stale and bland in comparison.

I got it for the multiplayer lobby experience, and it fell severely short. It doesn't feel epic and modern, but rather a time machine back to 2010. The graphics are extremely plain, the gun play feels simple, and it feels extremely twitchy.

I see what they were trying to do when it came to what ""fun"" in a game means: move faster, move more. This is what Doom Eternal did, and it worked. But BO7 missed the mark by not providing a punchy, fun, and suspenseful feeling to go along with the quick movement. Everything feels ... limp. I'm not sure how else to put it.

Plus the sound design of this game is leagues behind the recent extraction shooter that just came out.

Everything about this game just feels very one-dimensional.

Even the voice acting lacks emotion and feeling. I'm unsure if they used AI to do the narration, but if they didn't, they need to fire their VA's and replace them lol. If they used AI, they need to do a better job at prompting. I'm not against the use of AI to design a game, but if the game isn't a fun experience, then it doesn't matter if they use AI or not.

I'm not even going to bother with the campaign. I've heard and read enough about that experience to know it's going to be a joke on a stick.

In the very first mission I was kicked for inactivity while moving in prone, trying to stay undetected. The always online requirement makes things even worse, and the default setting that forces squad fill completely ruins the feel of a true solo campaign. Overall, it’s a thoroughly disappointing single player experience.

The graphics are a mixed bag. Cut scenes look fantastic, but in actual game play, objects and item outlines visibly pop in and out while standing still. It breaks immersion and feels unpolished.

Multiplayer, on the other hand, is genuinely great for COD fans and new players. They finally got that part right. Reused maps aren’t a problem, but some of the new ones feel too open on the left and right lanes, which leads to constant cross-fire from multiple angles. Still, aside from a few map issues, multiplayer is solid.

The game is really only worth it for multiplayer. With so many reused assets and a weak single-player mode, it’s hard to justify the $70 price tag. You’re better off waiting for a sale.",False,1,935

What an absolute fucking joke. It feels like they slapped a new number on the box, sprinkled some recycled features on top, and said “yeah fuck it, ship it.” This game plays like the same old crap they’ve been milking for a decade, just somehow worse.

I was hoping for even a tiny bit of that BO2 magic just a spark but nope. This thing has zero soul, zero passion, zero effort. It’s like the devs copy-pasted the game while half-asleep.

The campaign? Absolute bullshit. You can’t even play it solo. Who the fuck decided that was a good idea? The zombies mode is so mind-numbingly boring that I almost fell asleep mid round. I’ve had more fun watching paint dry. BO3 Zombies from 2015 is somehow a thousand times more fun how the hell is that even possible?

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209263696,"This is my review about Call of Duty - Black Ops 7 

Call of Duty is listed in my review as (Got for free) this is not true, this is only cause CALL OF DUTY has combined all their titles in one home game, this *HOME* is free for everyone.

I bought the Vault Edition on Playstation 5, 
because this is Steam, I will keep my review only about the aspects regarding the game itself. 



Multiplayer - MP
Zombies - ZW

MP = Maps - Alot of 'comebacks' of old maps from previous C.O.D titles, for 'veterans' is it a nice nostalgic map experience, it are small but providing areas with a fresh '2025' texture look. 

ZW = Maps - For now only one is live, more are coming if I heard it right. So far is the 'Ashes of the Damned' a large wide open map with alot of Easter Eggs, secrets and possibilities. They added some extra's but further then that, the rest is like most people are known with.

Gameplay - Same as every shooter, controls. (custom controls are possible - Playstation, Xbox, Keyboard). Only diffrence is the (re)added wall jump movements and 'wall double jumping'.

Skill Matching - MP - I Played every game mode, on average I am very skilled, but most random team and enemies are pretty balanced in playing. (1 out of 10 is like a 'please no').

Connection - so far hadn't got problems, server is stable I think

Campaign= I did not fully completed campaign, can't say too much about it yet, what I do know is that if you expect campaign mode to be played offline or like you expect it to be (from previous titles), I wont recommend buying the game for Campaign, if that is mainly your purpose. Besides that or If you don't care, the graphics, the cutscenes and music, the weapons and character/skill progress are very good.


*Score = All aspects per category = average = score*
 Conclusion: 

+ M.P 8/10
+ Z.W 7/10
- Campaign 5/10

! 
About the price on every platform is (expensive) for what they offer *RIGHT NOW* altough alot of things and content expect to be added in the near future, so probaly around then it would fit the price.

Call of Duty - Black Ops 7 

My average score total: 6.5 of 10

There’s a wall-hack sniper rifle (“The Gravemaker”) that lets you see through walls, and a lot of players are calling it broken.

GamesRadar+

No Pause in Campaign

Several players are furious that you can’t pause the campaign mode. > “you’re telling me i can’t even pause my game?” 
Reddit
+1

That’s a pretty big deal for people who like to play solo or in short bursts.

Always-Online Requirements

It seems like the campaign and other modes require a constant online connection, which annoys players who want a more traditional offline experience. 
Reddit
+1

This ties in with the pause issue: because it's always online, they may not have built in a pause feature.

Scope Creep / Series Fatigue

Some long-time CoD fans feel like the franchise is becoming repetitive: same movement mechanics, similar UI, and too many “pay-for” cosmetics. > “every game now feeling the same again and again.” 
Reddit

There’s frustration with the business model — yearly releases, microtransactions, and battle passes.

Narrative Might Be Overly Complex / Fragmented

While some praise the campaign for being “hallucinogenic” and ambitious, others point out that the story leans heavily on past games, which could alienate newcomers. 
Diario AS

The Endgame mode (co-op, open-world-ish) is cool to some, but others say it overlaps too much with the main story.

There’s a report that Activision used AI to generate some in-game assets, which has raised eyebrows about quality and effort.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209259320,"★☆☆☆☆ Black Ops 7 Campaign Review: A Confusing Fever Dream With Guns

Playing the Black Ops 7 campaign feels like eating a bowl of cereal only to realize halfway through that it’s actually drywall crumbs and no one knows who poured it. The game insists it has a deep, emotional, world-shattering narrative, but honestly? I’ve seen clearer storytelling in IKEA instruction manuals — at least those come with little pictures so you know what's happening.

The plot jumps around so much that by Mission 3 I thought my console was skipping. One minute you're infiltrating a secret base, the next you're in a flashback, inside a dream, inside someone else's flashback, narrated by a guy who feels like he’s making it up as he goes. By Mission 6 I was expecting the game to suddenly ask me about my car’s extended warranty.

The characters? Imagine trying to bond with cardboard cutouts, except the cutouts occasionally yell military clichés like “We don’t leave people behind!” before immediately leaving someone behind. The villain shows up roughly twice, says something sinister, and then apparently goes on vacation for the rest of the campaign.

Gameplay-wise, the missions swing between “walk forward and shoot things” and “walk forward slightly slower and shoot things while the NPC next to you delivers emotional monologues that sound AI-generated.” The game pretends to offer choices, but the only real decision you get is whether to roll your eyes now or later.

And the ending… oh boy. It feels like the writers had a meeting, collectively forgot what the story was about, shrugged, and slapped on a twist so confusing it may actually violate several storytelling laws.

In short: If you want a campaign that makes you question reality, coherence, and your own life choices, Black Ops 7 has you covered. If you want a good campaign? Try literally anything else — maybe even those IKEA instructions.",False,0,5

Let me just preface this by saying that I bought the game specifically for zombies, and I did not get the chance to try MP or the Campaign. I didn't really get to try zombies either though, because out of about 6 good games attempted, the game crashed 3 times. Maybe that is tolerable in MP, but when you are investing more than an hour into a great game of zombies, knowing that odds are good that you are not going to get to finish is the worst.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209236470,"I tried going into this with low expectations because of videos I saw saying it was gonna be trash, but unironically this game is so fucking fun. Multiplayer is so far 7/10, i wish it had gun game but i guess it makes sense since non of us have all the weapons unlocked and it might be too early for it. The non-sbmm matchmaking is truly living up to what the COD community wanted, the standard moshpit is kind of hidden enough that I feel like nobody is going to actually use it and will instead use the open moshpit. The non-disbanding lobbies are another positive, however it does suck that nobody is on the mic.

Now zombies, I did not expect to have this much fucking fun on zombies, i'm a multiplayer player only usually but i tried the survival zombies mode and god damn was it fun, made it until round 25 but my team decided they wanted to exif or whatever even though I was down to go another 20 rounds. I would say zombies is 8/10, i just don't really like the armour system because it just becomes a game of remembering to put my armour on. 

If you are reading this just be aware that most reviews here right now are bf6 players mass-negative reviewing this game, i personally don't care that much, any competition is good competition, but just be aware of this if you are using reviews to dictate if you want to get this or not. I do think BO7 actually has a chance at becoming one of the best COD's, and i'm saying this as someone who's favourite COD game is BO3 and BO2 (the nostalgia bait worked, highjacked plays really well, and the wall jumping this is close enough to bo3's wallride that it makes me happy). 

Now about the small bits of negatives i have for this game: 1.) some of the menu text is messed up as in sometimes it overlaps. 2.) Who even came of with the COD launcher thing, it's clunky and annoying. 3.) The game takes far too long to load up, as in GTA5 levels of loading time. 4.) for launch day I was expecting a bit more challenges to level up fast, im surprised to only be doing 5.) the game chat is a bit too hidden, I would prefer if all we had to do type was click y instead of going on a whole other menu. 6.)

Even if you have 70$ Burning a hole in your pocket it is not worth it. I have never in my life played a game that sucks this bad. Even the last 5 games sucked but had enjoyable gun-play mechanics - not this game. The guns are terrible, the maps are terrible, the movement is somehow more sluggish even with wall-running, and everyone you fight is guaranteed to be using a cronus. 

If you're wanting to play the campaign - don't bother, it's slop

If you're wanting to play Zombies - don't bother, it's slop. And to add to that, why are there vehicles in Zombies? This is such a terrible idea and it feels awful to play. 

If you're wanting to play Multiplayer - DO NOT BOTHER- IT IS SLOP - Even BO4 and 6 felt better to play than this. ALSO there is somehow major lag sutters from packetloss that freeze your game at least 3 times a match. I have 1BG/s internet speeds and felt like I was playing with 10Mb/s speeds on BO2. This is pathetic and a waste of time and money. 

My score? 1/10, as a longtime COD fan since COD 3, this is a complete slap in the face. I refunded after 4 awful MP matches which all played on the same 2 maps (not a big map pool) and 1 round of zombies that was extremely depressing to play considering how good Bo1, Bo2, Bo3, and even Bo4 zombies is. Heck, I would even put IW and AW zombies over this abomination of a so-called zombies mode.

1. If you want to have fun then go play BF6, it’s cheaper and better than BO7

2. As an OG cod player, it hurts seeing this franchise fall this low. It’s a cash grab every year now

3. I sacrificed my wallet to save you from this travesty (it has more bugs and microtransactions than fresh content)

4. Anyone celebrating just for the removal of SBMM is on high COPE, it would have stayed if BF6 hadn’t released this year and it can come back anytime if they feel like it. they removed it out of desperation. Also, Infinity Ward is coming next year so good luck with that. 

5. (To devs) Remove the TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements as cheaters walk past them very easily and it's becoming a headache for new players. Stop ignoring the player feedbacks and fix the frequent crashes if you want a comeback for real next time.

Personal thought:  I think Activision is probably too scared to try anything new at this point. Just keeping it alive by milking the game with massive AI content and crossover events now and somehow COD players are still lining up for it.

Funny thing is, I’ve never heard CoD players go after Battlefield the same way.

I own both games and, objectively, CoD is the one I keep coming back to. It’s polished, runs smoothly, and I haven’t hit a single bug or cheater so far. The gameplay is quick and satisfying, and every gun I’ve tried is actually fun instead of a painful grind. BF6 makes early weapons feel like a punishment and unlocking anything takes forever. Here, progression is fast and enjoyable. New guns, attachments, toys to play with, all without dumping 500 hours into the grind.

The maps are great and the walljump surprised me in the best way. I thought I’d hate it, but it feels fantastic. Overall, the game is just pure joy to play.

Call of Duty used to be a franchise built on innovation, iconic gameplay and unforgettable moments. Today, it feels like a factory product—rushed, uninspired, and stuck in a loop of repeating the same mistakes year after year.

Multiplayer:
The multiplayer is a mess. The time-to-kill is absurdly low, movement feels stiff yet chaotic at the same time, and the map design ranges from painfully linear corridors to empty, oversized spaces with no real flow. Skill-Based Matchmaking turns every match into a sweaty tournament instead of something fun.

Warzone:
Warzone is drowning in bugs, lag spikes, broken hit detection and questionable balance decisions. Looting feels inconsistent, gunfights feel random, and cheaters still ruin entire matches despite years of promises.

Content & Monetization:
Instead of meaningful content, we get overpriced skins, crossover bundles that don’t fit the game at all, and recycled ideas disguised as “new seasons.” Features get removed, reintroduced, changed again, or simply forgotten. Nothing feels stable or coherent.

Technical Issues:
Crashes, server instability, poor optimization—these problems appear every single year. For a AAA franchise, it’s unacceptable.

And Black Ops 7? Just as bad.

Black Ops 7 was hyped as a “return to form,” but it delivers the same recycled gameplay, shallow design, and technical problems as the rest. It adds nothing new, fixes next to nothing, and feels like a copy-paste of previous titles with a fresh coat of paint.
It’s disappointing, predictable, and absolutely not worth the price tag.

Final Verdict:

Call of Duty is no longer a passionate shooter experience—it’s a yearly product pumped out with minimal effort. If you’re looking for fun, creativity or quality, Black Ops 7 and the entire current CoD lineup will only leave you frustrated.",False,0,15254

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209170702,"Many of these games are plagued with issues stemming from their over-reliance upon SBMM to retain playercount and the constant release of unbalanced bundles. The campaign is consistently and unapologetically propaganda with poor narrative structuring and no sense of stakes every year for the last six years, and recently they've just tried to make every campaign a lazily slapped together warzone map with the same characters as games from 2010. The bundles I mentioned before get more and more stupid looking every month or so over the course of the year incrementally to the point where at the end, I expect a literal downs syndrome operator being pushed out (would still be more bearable than chucky). The ranked play has a hidden axis of SBMM so you have fake platinums running around not playing the objective if you're unfortunate enough to have not done well on the previous match. The maps often have poor spawn mechanics, sometimes spawning you right next to groups of enemies. We thought this was going to be fixed after the beta every year, but it never was. The zombies feels like an empty husk of all those nachts we left behind, with warzone mechanics and repetitive, easy gameplay. All of this, as bad as it somehow is, doesn't outweigh the positives of this game however. I genuinely love the feeling of playing a hardpoint match on skyline in ranked play when the teams are balanced and the spawns function properly. Gunfight is endearing as hell, as you and a buddy can menace the other team more personally when you win and then intensify that behavior more when you lose immediately after. There's hardly a source of dopamine in the world that outweighs queuing with your friends in resurgence warzone and then barely rubbing out a victory when you're heavily outnumbered. The camos on the guns being able to be combined with the blueprints is a genius system and results in some stunning outcomes. The process of leveling is neither too slow or too fast, and gives me the sensation of always having a direct goal put in front of me, whether it's a camo or an unlockable item. There are a LOT of things to do in this game. Once a zombies match hits level 30, it suddenly becomes one of the most enjoyable things about this purchase, with hectic squeezes requiring precise coordination with your team, and bosses actually fulfilling their design philosophy. I both hated and loved this game, and it was a rollercoaster for the entire year. Black Ops 7 releases in 30 minutes, and you can bet your ass I preordered it and maxed out the beta.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209170088,"I have been a huge fan of the COD games from the very first one. The game itself can be a lot of fun, has good graphics, and the multiplayer part playing with friends can be a blast. With that said, these games seem to have more issues as each new one is released. Activision and their parent company Microsoft have made it very apparent that they do not value their decade or more loyal fans. It is becoming more and more about just what skins and other stuff they can sell in the game or charge $30 for one season of the Blackcell pass for example. Like zombies? Lot of fun in this game....when you can use fun things like the gum especially. But once you hit a high enough level you stop earning any of the good ones by playing and they want you to buy them in the store. The days of paying for a game you enjoy and then unlock everything from gameplay and skill while the developers focus first and foremost on functionality and treating their loyal customers like they aren't something to just blatantly take advantage of. As they focus on these things as well as the chat ban vs. caring about cheating issue (will explain next) the quality of the game, functionality, cheating, mentality of the true problem people, lag, crashes, etc. are all affected by this.

Last thing, the chat ban using AI part they began using in BO6. I have heard people say the most obscene things you can say and they are reported and nothing happens. Some even brag that they have paid somehow to not get banned. Yet if you say certain select words in a MA rated game about shooting people you are banned for a couple of weeks on average with no way to appeal it. Now if someone is clearly hacking and you report them, nothing is done 99% of the time. 

The point is this and many other COD games are overall a lot of fun. But this focus on being most concerned about single words being said in a non-threatening purely opinion expressing way one time and you can be banned 15 seconds later as well as focus on profit to a far too extreme degree given the cost to the players in quality of the game experience is ruining these games. I never write reviews but I am far from the only person who feels this way. 

If they simply used people to determine bans and had an actual appeal process available a certain amount of times to determine which people truly are a problem and listened to the input of their long-time fans and accepted a small profit reduction to fix these things they probably would make more once some of the people they have lost for these reasons came back and played the new COD games again when released. Maybe they will realize a lot more people than they think aren't stupid and are aware of this scheme to keep people playing as long as possible to sell things and once you no longer have incentive of a level to go any higher you all of a sudden have to purchase things you easily would earn before that.",False,1,129216

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,209156042,"PLayed the BO7 campaign, finished all missions and unlocked endgame. Gotta say it's the most fun I've ever played since MW2019. Every Mission is atmospheric and frenetic af. Ain't no way someone getting bored here. I tip my hat to activision, cuz OMG! visual fidelity wise crisp and so stunning. The details in cutscenes are INSANE! I flipping love it!!! The game also offers ray traced reflections (OFC OPTIONAL). If your PC is beefy enough, go for it. I have a RTX 5080, played on 4k with RT on high (is the max) and DLSS - not a single performance issue.  Overall the campaign is sick and I would recommend to play at least once the campaign. If you don't like CoD, listen that's totally fine, just get a PC gamepass and enjoy the story once. 

Multiplayer is amazing and Activision made a mistake here, which is missleading. So there are 2 playlists for MP. The Open playlist as we know with ""no sbmm"" and there is a second playlist called Standard, which has the known SBMM since MW2019. I don't know why, but the ""Standard"" isn't the Standard. That's so confusing I know. While Open Playlist offers full range of game modes, the standard one has only single game mode called moshpit. 

Because of this people think SBMM is back as default, but that isn't true. Open is still the default, at least for now and I don't think this will change in future. Activision should rework the terminology of the playlist to avoid further confusion.  As for the gameplay, come on XD It's CoD! creme de la creme frenetic fun gunplay. Either you like it or not - it is how it is. And if yall think open playlist is less sweaty PHAHAHAHAHA keep belivin that I guess x'D Me personally, I love it!

First off, the game is extremely demanding if you come from a game like Rainbow 6 Siege, Valorant or Fortnite (CS2 players are too invested to dare to switch games) if you play WZ on lowest settings it still looks pretty good though, I personally would add a color filter to it through the NVIDIA App or AMD Software.

Warzone is well-known to be riddled with cheaters, but now it seems to be way better than it used to. I have only rarely encountered any cheaters. 

In WZ there are casual modes, which at the core are the same as the normal one, but have bots. If you play the casuals and drop 30 bombs, you will still not hold up by yourself in the normal modes, but if you grind enough and get your game-sense right you can surely integrate to the normal modes.

    If you want a solid FPS experience go play Battle Field 6, if you want an actually playable and enjoyable zombies experience go buy BO1, BO2, or BO3, (which is 1/10th the disc space and 1000x higher quality of gameplay and map design).

    It is sad to see that call of duty has gone down the rabbit hole of greed. After the removal of David Vauhndihar and Jason Blundell it has been clear through the reuse of assets and game mechanics that Treyarch and all other COD titles no longer care in innovate and grow the game in a positive way. 

    If you look at BO1-BO4 they pushed these games to their limits, With story line, Gameplay, and Map design. You will never see passion like those games again from this title unless they completely gut all their major devisions and create a quality game. 

    My simple solution, show ads during loading screens. Make the shop a 3 click access, DO NOT FORCE THE PLAYER INTO THE SHOP ON GAME START UP. FUCK COMSETICS. and bring back PAID DLCs. Take pride in your work and try and make a game that players will enjoy. Not for the middle schoolers. but for adults. the people who grew up on this game. 

    Take Vanoss Gamings COD video. He doesnt play anymore because its too competitive. Its not fun. COD is not a fucking fun game anymore, Its a waste of hard drive space and a waste of money. I will not be purchasing a COD game until it meets my expectations which im entirely confident that it never will. I highly suggest if you are reading this to up vote it and help this studio realize what their priorities need to be. Fuck you Treyarch. You used to give me shivers now all you give me is disgust and resentment.",False,0,12073

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,208972285,"BO6 is an enjoyable game when it hits its stride. I was, at first, able to put aside the aggressive commercialisation of the game due to its excellent game feel. But then...

With the imminent release of BO7, a 70GB update has been released. It downloads BO7 content, even if you have not bought it. The launcher has been updated; a one-time, unskippable video plays out after the download, and it asks you to do the first time setup again. BO6 is now a separate executable, but still must be launched via the COD app. BO6 has been significantly cut down, with all playlists except 3 moshpits removed.

To reiterate, all players are required to get a 70GB download for BO7, even if you do not want it, and the matchmaking of BO6 has been gutted. Truthfully, I was beginning to get tired of BO6's maps by this stage anyway - they are too clearly drawn to fit a three-lane template - but with the heavy-handed push to attempt to force users to move to BO7, Activision are poised to turn many players sour.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,208911331,"Honestly, I don’t like a few things about this game. For one, it makes no sense that when you jump out of the plane with a parachute, you don’t actually have your own weapons with you. Instead, you have to run around opening crates to find guns and armor, which just feels completely unrealistic. On top of that, I think it’s unfair that more experienced players—at least it seems this way—get better default gear or advantages. As a new player, you’re at a disadvantage from the start, which just doesn’t feel fair. A game should be balanced so that everyone has an equal footing, whether they’re new or veterans.

Also, the whole idea of this gas closing in on the map at a ridiculous speed is just stupid. Instead of focusing on combat, you end up running from this gas cloud that moves almost as fast as you do. It’s totally ridiculous, and they should make it more realistic. And another thing, when you jump out of the plane, a parachute is a one-time thing. You shouldn’t be able to use it every single time you jump off a building. You should have to use stairs or ropes or something realistic. And the soldier movements are just nonsense—like a soldier jumping around in a way that would never happen.

In short, they need to fix the game to be more realistic: you jump out of the plane with your weapons, everyone should have equal conditions, and get rid of the gas concept if you just want to rush the match. If people want fast matches, have a separate mode for that. But if it’s a war game, let it be a real war game.",False,0,10383

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,208908961,"i got back into this because of 2019 MW and it was awesome...until the hacking...well MW2, MW3, Coldwar, Black ops 6 EVERYTHING since 2019 has been ruled by hackers, it doesn't matter if you play warzone or black ops, hell i even found a hacker in zombies. The game fell apart mid MW and when MW2 hit the game mechanics and bugs were a massive issue, took almost until MW3 to fix, i didn't get it, there were positive reviews but still had issues and hackers, We've been promised since 2019 that hackers will be dealt with and every new game theres promises of better anti cheats that activistion created instead of getting some actual good anti cheats and hackers fly through this supposid anti cheat because it's just gotten worse. Now a lot of hackers ""closet hack"" so try not to show they're hacking with at least having walls cause that's all you need. I keep taking brakes months at a time and just got back into it for the halloween event and no joke from game 1 there were problems and about 2 weeks or less of play i've heard from others that a lot of these problems happened months prior but no fixes which means when i was done for awhile more BS just happened. Theres now an exploit in hardcore S&D that allows your AMP to hear footsteps usable the entire game instead of just being a field upgrade you can occasionally use depending on how well you do. The games a joke and i still hear people are gonna buy BO7 which releases in a week and thats the problem, all the skins and other in app purchases is what runs this and makes the company not give a f**k about their product, it's a game that feels like the creators don't play. Sad thing is i kept this short, i have spent 1000+ hours i practically lived in this game Regardless warzone or multiplayer i rocked at this game, love it more than others but all these problems just make it not fun then you add the hackers and you get more pissed off that this isn't being dealt with that it's like...why do i even play and keep dropping the game for months at a time just to come back and find new problems and some massive issues still not fixed. Oh another new issue is you can start in the game but the game keeps random people from actually starting for 5 seconds or more so when you do by the time you move the enemies are coming around the corner of your spawn or depending on the map killed you the second you could move. again i mainly play HC S&D so not respawning until next round really impacts you. If you enjoy zombies though, it's nice for that, i only ran into a hacker 3 times out of the time i've played which was most of my game time until i hopped into multiplayer. I have been considering buying a copy for my brother JUST for zombies  cause he doesn't like COD in general but zombies he had fun with previous titles and i think zombies was the biggest improvement and had some good devs working on it. Just irritated about the Anti Cheat portion of the company.",False,0,68694

Back then, I was playing daily and genuinely enjoying the game.

Unfortunately, everything changed with the release of Black Ops 6. Movement became unnecessarily complicated, making gameplay feel less fluid and enjoyable. Skins and cosmetic items have started to feel more like jokes than rewards, and the overall quality  that used to define the series seems to be missing. Cheaters are still a problem, and while there is an anti-cheat system in place, it hardly feels effective.

The game feels overcomplicated and overly focused on flashy, high-tech gadgets rather than solid gunplay and map design. Everything moves so fast now that strategy and tactical play often take a backseat to chaotic sprinting and futuristic abilities. The maps feel cluttered, the killstreaks and tech can be overwhelming, and it’s hard to feel the same satisfaction from a clean gunfight as you did in the older titles. For longtime fans, it’s frustrating to see the series trade the simplicity and balance that made it fun for a spectacle-heavy, hyper-technical shooter that often feels more stressful than enjoyable.",False,0,13

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,208714765,"Review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II

Honestly, this was the worst 110 minutes I’ve ever spent on a game. Modern Warfare II feels like a recycled mess that the developers clearly only care about milking for cash. The same dumb glitches that have been around for over a year are still there — broken hit detection, random crashes, and bugs that make you wonder if they even test their updates.

Instead of fixing the problems or improving gameplay, they just keep pumping out overpriced skins and “new” bundles like that’s what anyone actually asked for. It’s all about the microtransactions now, not the players.

I gave it another shot hoping it might’ve improved since launch — big mistake. Nothing has changed except my patience. This game isn’t worth your time or money.

The new MW reboot series is ok, not as over the top as the classic ones. However, MW3 dropped the ball and became a war zone clone with no effort taken into it. Storyline is half interesting and characters are half developed and killed off insignificantly. However, this game is for the multiplayer. It's the only fast-paced twitch shooter you're gonna get. Gun play is smooth like a typical COD game but it certainly gets boring after a while even BO. There's nothing interesting about COD anymore.

Activision does not listen, the zombies they come out with is crap, and they charge full price for a 10 year old game. Thank you DICE for rising to the occasion and putting a big fat boot on CoD's neck. I hope someone else picks up making round based zombies so this franchise can die.",False,1,5278

They just collab it with any new game launching ,
This makes warzone sick , they didnt even thinking abt optimisation as a priority

Grind battle pass for epic flatline blueprint. Activision: ""Two passes/season, $20 each!"" Steam goes Mostly Negative—""$70 DLC scam!"" I uninstall... reinstall for Warzone integration. Cheaters? Banned 65k, but new ones spawn like zombies. Ricochet: ""99% cheater-free!"" Me: ""In what universe?""
Day 3500: Cheater Chronicles Reloaded
Pred? Nah, Iridescent full of spinbots. Console ""safe""? Cronus/XIM mag-dumps. PC? Wallhacks every 2/3 games. Watch death cam: Enemy snaps 180° through walls. Anti-cheat waves? Cheaters laugh, buy new accounts. I report 50, get ""false positive"" shadowban. Playing with bots now—literal ones.
Day 5000: Operator Overload
Main Ghost—OP! Nerf. Switch Soap—slide cancel queen! Nerf. Every gun: Buff week 1, trash week 2. Perks? Spam the meta 3. Spawns? Behind you, always. ""Open Beta no SBMM"" lied—full release is sweat factory. Every legend balanced like my K/D: 0.8 forever.
Sound & Graphics: Boom... Then Crash (Until Packet Loss)
Gunshots? Crisp pew-pew. Explosions? Hollywood BOOM. Then smoke—white void hell. Footsteps? Hear from orbit, yours? Muted. Controller vibrates mid-clutch... disconnects. ""FUUUUUUUUCK MY LOADOUT!"" Neighbors: ""SWAT or COD?""
Community: Toxic Family Reunion

Russian: ""CYKA SLIDE BLYAT"" (dies first).
Solo savior: ""Ping rez"" (ghosts).
Me: ""Group?"" → Mute + ""FEEDER NOOB.""
Streamers: Hacked, DDOS'd. Pros: ""Cheaters ruined ranked.""

Optimization: Activision's Prank DLC
FPS: 300 firing range → 40 in TDM. Ping: 20 solo → 180 crossplay. Crashes: Mid-1v3 ace. Hitreg: Bullets teleport. ""Server issues!"" Every patch: 100GB download for ""bug fixes"" that add more bugs.
Conclusion: Why I Haven't Quit (Send Help)
MW3 isn't a game—it's a masochist simulator. Every loss: ""Skill issue/SBMM/cheater?"" Every win: God mode (rare). Spent $500 on bundles invisible in shadowban. Cheaters banned? Respawn tomorrow. But that one 20-kill game... pure crack.
Recommend if:

You love screaming at Cronus kids.
Training patience for 200ms peeks.
Broke but flex $1000 tracer packs.

Silver 4 Pro Tip:
""Teammate calls bot? 'At least I don't Cronus—your aim's Ricochet-free!' Roasted.""

the last CoD i played was BO2, and loved every bit of it till the hacks, and cheats got to a point where i couldnt stand it anymore. 

i returned to to CoD with MW3, and heavily enjoyed it, and thought they improved their anti cheat.

then came BO6, which i preordered with high hopes, only to be let down. 

people dont even attempt to try to hide they are cheating. 

as a OG from xbox, xbox 360, to PC, the developers let us down. 

its sad to see CoD, and CS:GO be rewarded to the same group of people.

The game used to be fun, I used to buy every title. I will never ever ever give any cod title my money ever again. I played COUNTLESS hours of warzone, mw,  mwII, mwIII, and the newer black ops. Nothing new is ever added into the game. It always feels like they use nostalgia in order to sell new titles NOT new features or better gameplay. I tried to come back to warzone and BO6 one last time before I leave the franchise forever but I simply cannot bring myself to play these games anymore. The original MW2 made me fall in love with video games, the state of cod right now makes me ashamed to know ive ever spent anytime playing these titles. Save your money, save your time. At this point ever since redsec dropped for battlefield I uninstalled warzone quick as heck. Every conversion kit and ""meta"" weapon build is cringe i hate everything about this game. It will never be warzone during early covid and ill remember that time fondly.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207906697,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 oferuje naprawdę solidną kampanię fabularną, którą można uznać za jeden z mocniejszych punktów serii w ostatnich latach. Recenzenci chwalą zarówno różnorodność misji, jak i tematykę – mamy tu szpiegowskie intrygi, globalne konflikty, oraz spiski sięgające głęboko w historię lat 90. Poza tym gra wygląda imponująco – grafika, dźwięk i wykonanie cieniowania czy animacji stoją na wysokim poziomie, co pomaga w zanurzeniu się w świecie gry. 
GameOnly.pl

Nie mniej ważny jest aspekt wieloosobowy – tryby sieciowe oraz pojawienie się systemu „Omnimovement” (ruch wielokierunkowy) wprowadzają świeżość w rozgrywce. Dzięki temu mechanika strzelania, tempo starć i dynamika map znacznie zyskały na jakości. Recenzje wskazują, że multiplayer działa bardzo przyjemnie i dostarcza satysfakcji zarówno dla nowych, jak i powracających graczy. 

Podsumowanie
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 to mocny powrót formy serii – posiada angażującą kampanię, świetny silnik wieloosobowy oraz dopracowaną oprawę techniczną. Dla fanów strzelanek liniowych, którzy oczekują dobrej jakości i dobrego „gunplayu”, zdecydowanie warto rozważyć tę produkcję.

I remember when a new Call of Duty felt like a separate game... something new and breathtaking. It wasn't always innovative, and sometimes formulaic. Why wouldn't it be? It worked, it was fun, and continued to take our attention away every fall season. Nowadays, a sense of ""new"" seems like a massive second thought. Activision is content on selling consumers a $70 dollar expansion pack every year, with minimal changes, and still have the audacity to charge every single season for Battle Passes and cosmetics. The last time I enjoyed a Call of Duty year round, and still play it often, was Modern Warfare (2019). That was the final time in my memory that I sat down with a Call of Duty, taken aback by the improvements. I could feel the love put into the game from the developers. That game felt like a love letter, not only to the fans, but to Call of Duty itself. Since then, they have done nothing but destroy the core values, and what made Call of Duty special. Do not buy Black Ops 7. It will only do irreparable damage to what you loved about Call of Duty and it's previous sub-franchises.

[b] Quick note that I have only played Warzone and the modes that come with it so this review is based solely on that experience [/b]
Call of Duty Warzone is a very clean shooter experience with a couple glaring issues making it hard to enjoy. Movement is not very responsive and feels awkward to control. Shooting feels amazing and is probably the best part about the experience, it's clean, precise and gunfights are fast and satisfying. There are two modes I played extensively enough to review and that is Battle Royale and Resurgence. I would give BR a 5/10 because the map design is not very good and the map in general is way too big for the kind of game this is. I said before that gunfights are quick and because of that the huge map feels empty very quickly, when you do find someone, the outcome of the fight is decided usually under 10 seconds so it feels like a lot of walking and looting for what ends up being a mediocre end. Resurgence on the other hand I would give a 7/10 and is a much better experience overall. Where BR falls short because of the fast gunfights, resurgence embraces it as the main gameplay mechanic, where you respawn over and over until your team is wiped. This suits the tight, precise shooting style of the game and is actually a really fun experience I would recommend.
Aesthetically the game is extremely dark and gray, while this suits the setting of the game it does end up being exceptionally boring. Collabs attempt to spice things up, but weird choices like American Dad and Chucky feel so out of place and ugly in the otherwise tactical art direction.
Overall Call of Duty isn't bad but based on my experience it can be very unsatisfying. Movement is limited and there is a lack of anything unique to make games stand out from each other, there aren't any moments where something particularly surprising or new happens because it is just the most bare shooter possible. Although it feels really clean and Resurgence is admittedly addicting, you can get that experience in a different Free-to-play game and the file size being over 100gb even at the minimum makes it extremely hard to justify keeping this in your library.",False,0,565

That was when I decided I'd had enough COD in my life and uninstalled the game permanently.

I'm 35 years old and have played COD since the original COD set in WW2 was released in 2003. I've played every single one of their games since and for a spell in my 20s streamed it regularly through Twitch.
I am one of the original players who helped make COD into the global RTS juggernaut it is today, and my verdict has changed from one of the greatest games of all time. Now my verdict is this:

The game is sloppy, messy, awkward and catering to zoomers with ADHD medication on hold at their local pharmacy. The game has turned itself from an amazing, immersive game, into a pathetic, self-deprecating joke, taking whatever obnoxious collabs they can manage to secure no matter how invasive or fundamentally idiotic it is. It decided to live by the saying 'If you can't beat them? Join them!' and leaned fully into its most destructive playerbase since the original CODMW2 multiplayer in 2009: The memers, the trolls and the obnoxious children with chronic keyboardwarrioritis. You'll know the people I'm talking about. You can recognize them when they write in the comments below, accusing me of writing this with AI. Lol. Those same children playing at 8-11 years old in 2009 are now older, and have their own credit cards to influence the game's direction with; and it showed the moment Roger from Family Guy called an airstrike on me.

The game is visually beautiful, but that's where the quality ends and the self-destructive indifference begins. No developer is as unapologetically signed out of giving a flying ****, as Activision is.
They have huge cash cows like Blizzard Entertainment under their belt. They have grown so large and so wealthy that they honestly don't care if the game's dogwater anymore. They release games in piss-poor states, with offensively bad progression strategies, and directionless, immersion destroying half-a**ed indifference to the games' quality.
They release hot garbage, cause they KNOW people will play their hot garbage, and look what that has caused. It has destroyed COD as a game, and now it can't even take itself seriously enough to reinvent itself in an admirable, relatable direction; No, instead they give you confetti deaths, guns with waifu skins on them, bright pastel colored clown outfits and awkward, cartoon-visualized jarring skins that have absolutely zero place in the game as a whole.

The games were getting bad before, but they're downright disgusting now.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207462858,"This is completely biased toward Sony fanboys and ultimately they lose mass appeal. This write up is my personal opinion and is in no way endorsed or used to promote certain brands. There is a certain satisfaction in having a competitive edge that lead to eminent victories but the legend of Bagger Vance would persuade you otherwise that on the 18th hole you hit a birdie and not an eagle because the ball moved. It appears that today that is almost always going to be the truth if you own a DualShock 4 or later controller because of open source software like DS4Windows. My gripe in tolerating developer errors and the occasional game crash is imperative to winning and I mean winning a lot, like every exhibition if the opportunity presents itself.

Today this is possible thanks to what gamers call ""soft aim assist"" or aimbot. Now as far as I can remember creating rapid-fire was product of bypassing the circuit that led to your RT or RB with a switch or jumping the wires together. Today we have programs like the aforementioned that make the use of a controller with paddles obsolete. Specifically in games that have the ability to jump, the use of a paddle could make it so that you could control the joystick and the jump button without having to move your thumb and instead press one of the reprogrammed paddle buttons on a pricy aftermarket controller.

I've never purchased a DualShock controller because I've always played on Xbox and if you know those controllers you wouldn't want to buy a Sony. But today you have to because of programs that allow you to enhance the already buffed aim assist and if you are able to afford the one with more buttons hypothetically you are no longer playing a game that requires precision and skill but rather a contest and with any contest the loser is almost always the one that is not enhancing their performance. Personally you could defeat an unskilled opponent that relies on your lack of awareness.

What are your thoughts on defaulting to Sony engineered controllers, even in competitive settings? Whilst the other options are not readily detected in interfaces like DualShock windows. Sometimes its just fun to play the game but what happens when you become good, do you have the ability to just turn off the assists or are you just going to be mediocre and not nearly as amazing when you do use the DualShock functionality either way.",False,0,7044

* SBMM kills your vibe to play the game after a few good matches,
* Internet connectivity was AWFUL most of the time (In this day and age?????),
* Only game modes for weapon camo grind were half decent + Nuketown and even they just make you brain rot after a few matches,
* Unlocking stuff from armory requires you to literally give up your life to play with the guns you like but weren't there to get it at first(each gun requires 250,000 xp to unlock!),
* there were black cell, premium and normal battle passes in addition to event passes that cost even more extra money (of course there are bundles as well, each of them costing you about 20 USD and the game it self is 70 USD MINIMUM),
* There was always this obligation to  play with every meta instead of actually playing the game for fun & creativity with your own costume load out otherwise you wouldn't have fun,
* Don't even expect to have a military shooter vibe set in 90's when you play this game,
* story was MID and ending was WEAK, it was just gassed by the same people who have brought COD to this point,
* Devs will probably certainly forget about this game a couple of months after release of BO7, (and this is just a side note from me , BO7 LOOKS and even SOUNDS EXACTLY THE SAAAAAAME! Just with a coat of futuristic paint on it).

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207398470,"After playing Call of Duty: Warzone for about 40 hours, I can honestly say I’m hooked. The game is fast, intense, and super satisfying once you get into the rhythm. The gunplay feels really smooth, and every match has that adrenaline rush — especially in those last few circles when it’s down to just a few squads.

I’ve really come to appreciate how the loadout system works. Being able to customize my weapons to fit my playstyle makes a big difference, and getting my loadout mid-match always feels like a power-up moment. The map is huge and full of action, with tons of different places to drop depending on how aggressive or strategic I want to play.

Even after 40 hours, the game still feels fresh. No two matches ever play out the same way — sometimes it’s chaos right from the start, other times it’s a slow build-up to an epic final fight. Playing with friends makes it even better; coordinating attacks and trying to pull off a clutch win is just pure fun.

Overall, Warzone has been a great experience for me so far. It’s got that perfect mix of skill, teamwork, and luck that keeps me saying, “Just one more match.”",True,2,4390

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207351606,"使命召唤bo6需要tpm2.0纯属商业欺诈 Call of Duty BO6 requires TPM2.0, which is purely a commercial fraud

After the release of BO7, it is equivalent to saying that BO6 also needs TPM2.0 secure boot to play. This is not a case of bullying consumers, and BO6 did not require TPM2.0 when it was launched. After purchasing the game, I now request to open tpm2.0. It is equivalent to saying that players who cannot open the game are those who have bought the game but cannot play it. This practice of adding terms after consumers purchase the product, which leads to consumers being unable to use the purchased product, is from any perspective considered as overbearing commercial fraud

等bo7推出后等于说bo6也需要tpm2.0安全启动才能玩，那这不是霸王条款欺诈消费者，bo6推出时也没要求tpm2.0。结果买了游戏后现在要求开tpm2.0。等于说开不了的玩家就是游戏买了却玩不了，这种让消费者购买商品后增加条款导致消费者购买商品不能使用的做法从任何角度讲都是霸王条款商业欺诈吧

按照bo6做法，那比如手机厂商推出个手机，等消费者购买后，提出新条款，必须在购买其他硬件才能使用，不购买就不能使用，和bo6一样，都是购买后推出新条款，一个是需要购买新硬件，而tpm2.0老式电脑要更换也需要购买新电脑配置，都是消费者要额外花费金钱才能使用，完全剥夺了消费者知情权和选择权，购买商品之前不告知，突然改变条款导致消费者不能使用商品也不允许消费者选择是否退款，这从任何角度讲都是在践踏消费者权益欺诈消费者

According to the Bo6 approach, for example, if a mobile phone manufacturer launches a phone and consumers propose new terms after purchasing it, they must purchase other hardware before they can use it. If they do not purchase it, they cannot use it. Like Bo6, new terms are introduced after purchase. One is that new hardware needs to be purchased, and if an old TPM2.0 computer needs to be replaced, a new computer configuration also needs to be purchased. Both require consumers to spend extra money to use it, completely depriving consumers of their right to know and choose. Without informing consumers before purchasing the product, suddenly changing the terms results in consumers being unable to use the product and not allowing them to choose whether to refund. From any perspective, this is trampling on consumer rights and deceiving consumers",False,2,24124

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207284047,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is exactly what longtime fans of the franchise have been waiting for. From the moment you jump in, it's clear Treyarch and Raven Software listened to community feedback and pushed the envelope in all the right ways.

The campaign is back in full force and absolutely nails the tone — gritty, cinematic, and full of twists. It feels like classic Black Ops storytelling, but sharper and more refined. The voice acting and set pieces are top-tier, and the pacing keeps you hooked from start to finish.

Multiplayer is where BO6 really shines. The maps are tight and well-designed, striking a perfect balance between fast-paced action and strategic depth. Gunplay feels smooth and satisfying, and the new movement system strikes a perfect middle ground between realism and fun. Weapon balancing is on point (so far), and progression feels rewarding without being grindy.

Zombies mode is a standout this time around — atmospheric, challenging, and packed with lore. Whether you're a solo player or teaming up with friends, there's a ton of replayability here.

BO6 doesn't try to reinvent the wheel — it just perfects it. With its polished gameplay, engaging content, and strong post-launch roadmap, this might just be the best Black Ops entry since BO2. If you're a CoD veteran or even just a casual FPS fan, Black Ops 6 is a must-play.",True,0,13575

This is not a game. It is a meticulously engineered cash machine dressed up as entertainment. Every year, the same recycled maps, the same weapons, and the same “new” modes get repackaged like it is some kind of innovation. It is obvious the developers could not be bothered to make anything truly fresh because why risk creativity when they can just squeeze the fanbase dry?

Microtransactions are shoved in your face everywhere. Want the full experience? That will cost extra. Cosmetics, battle passes, loot boxes, basically everything that could have been fun is locked behind a paywall or a grind designed to frustrate. The multiplayer is a chaotic mess that rewards pay-to-win behavior more than skill, and the matchmaking is broken, unbalanced, and seems designed to frustrate you into spending money on XP boosts.

Campaigns are equally insulting. They are hollow, cinematic fluff with all the depth of a puddle. The stories are recycled nonsense, the characters forgettable, and the gameplay feels like an afterthought. It is obvious these were designed to look good in trailers rather than provide a meaningful experience.

Graphically, it is a soup of mediocrity disguised with filters. Every feature screams “safe,” every mechanic screams “lazy.” There is no love, no care, just the cold, calculated greed of a corporation that knows its audience will open their wallets regardless of quality.

Call of Duty is not a game anymore. It is a product designed to make money, and anyone looking for actual fun is being actively exploited. Avoid it unless you enjoy being insulted while handing over your cash.",False,1,1765

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207210662,"[h1] A complete waste of time, money and storage space. [/h1]

My original review for this game, back when it was only Modern Warfare II, was going to be quite lengthy and in-depth. When Modern Warfare III released my review became egregiously long, even if my points were summarized concisely. Since then, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty Black Ops 7 have been released. This entry in the Steam store, this ""game"", is actually where you can purchase all of the aforementioned games and download Warzone for free. I have not actually played Black Ops 6 or 7 as I gave up on Call of Duty before those games launched. That makes this review somewhat pointless as now Modern Warfare II and III now have their own Steam store entries where one could purchase and review them individually, however I cannot do so because despite purchasing both games from this Steam entry, I did not purchase them after they were made available individually from the Steam store. Fantastic.

Even if I had played all 4 games, a thorough review of them would still be pointless in my opinion. No matter how thorough, it would ultimately be repeating points that have already been made to death and recounted in countless videos, articles, and other reviews. Furthermore, this isn't a case where there is some decency left that warrants at least some consideration over purchasing one of these games. Even if you justify some positive aspect, it is buried by numerous negative ones. I don't even know if the gameplay is good or feels good anymore. [b] In short, there is no point to any of these games. Both individually and collectively, they are all a waste of time. [/b] MWII was heavily flawed but had its moments, everything after is just terrible and replete with issues like awful UI, virtually no player socialization, original map design that is average at best, constant updates and shader compilations, to name a few. The ingame store is clearly the highest priority, and the game is constantly pushing the player to spend real money on CoD points to purchase items on top of marketing a seasonal battlepass. Said items are almost all gaudy cosmetics that completely ruin the game's identity. Are you purchasing a game? Or are you purchasing a store that has a half-assed game attached to it? Server issues and bugs are abound and there have been instances where players (including myself) have lost much of their earned progress, if not all of it. The singleplayer story isn't particularly good, the multiplayer is bland, zombies is silly in a very not-fun way and everything else in between is just pointless. Remember DMZ? What is the point of complimenting the graphical and audio fidelity of these games if its behind countless amounts of shaders that take a sometimes egregious amount of time to compile even on an excellent PC. Some of the ingame assests are AI generated, including some of the items available for purchase for real money in the ingame store! What do all of these devs actually work on? If they're willing to incorporate AI even to this ""smaller"" degree what's stopping them from using it for more content in the future or even future titles? Why should anyone ""support the devs"" by paying real money for any of it? The Warzone map is awful and with the new mechanics it is a bore to play at best and downright miserable at worst. It is nowhere close to the fun and intense experience of Warzone 1 on Verdansk. There are even more issues and even some missing features from previous titles, I am just scratching the surface. [b] I haven't even mentioned that all of the games combined are somewhere in the ballpark of 500gb [/b] last I checked. [b] The Warzone launcher alone is 160gb. [/b]

[b] If you loved Modern Warfare 2019 and/or Warzone 1 on Verdansk like I did, these games are not worth your time, money or storage space. There is nothing for you, for us, here. [/b] There is more, but I think I've made my point and presented the same conclusion that many have already arrived at. Call of Duty isn't dead, but it's husk, lacking in identity and real substance is a shameful amalgamation of the worst trends in AAA gaming implemented in the worst ways. Death, dignified or otherwise, would be a release for Call of Duty.",False,0,29247

Warzone is a good example of this and is why I no longer have a love for Warzone BECAUSE of the excessive number of HACKERS! I do want to give credit to CoD for trying to make the game fun and with recent news of possibly getting an actually functional anti-cheat in the game it does give me a slight bit of hope for the upcoming updates. I can not say if you should pay the money to play Black Ops 6 but if you are a fan and aren't looking to BE THE BEST or take the game play too seriously then this wouldnt be a bad game to put some time into. I do however have to agree that Black Ops 7 is definitely not worth picking up, from watching a lot of streams and videos on the game it doesnt look like something Id recommend playing BECAUSE there is literally no game and literally nothing actually fun looking even from the launch trailer. ALSO WE DONT NEED A NEW COD WHEN BLACK OPS 6 HAS BARELY BEEN OUT THAT LONG!!!!

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,207126534,"I’ve played almost every CoD since MW2, and honestly, Black Ops 6 is the first one in years that actually feels fresh. The campaign hooked me right away — it’s got that classic Treyarch intensity but with way more freedom. You can sneak, go loud, or mix both, and it never feels repetitive. The story’s tight, the pacing’s good, and it keeps you guessing all the way through.

Multiplayer’s where the game really shines. The new omnidirectional movement system changes everything — you can dive, strafe, and fight with way more control than before. Gunplay feels crisp, the maps are well-designed, and for once, time-to-kill feels balanced. It rewards skill but still lets casuals have fun.

Zombies is a huge win too. It feels like old-school survival but bigger — more to explore, more to do, and the atmosphere is top-tier. You can tell Treyarch put love back into it.

There are still minor gripes — a few skins are too flashy, and some missions drag — but overall, Black Ops 6 nails that mix of nostalgia and innovation. It’s fast, fun, and finally gives CoD fans something to get excited about again.",True,0,11194

I liked the single player campaign story , nice puzzles and the zombies actually fit the plot.
In multiplayer the game was similar to BO2 , the smg is king only rat snipers can get you :) In my opinion is very easy to get hip fire kills and grenade kills. The game has crossplay so it`s effortless to get a high kd ratio. Prone players are difficult to detect but after a kill the enemy model disappears so you can`t mistake them with a dead enemy.
The game has a lot of graphics options, and you can cap your FPS for menus and  gameplay individually and can display fps and gpu info. 
The steam version of the game had a problem after an update, the signle player wasn`t working ,someone shared a workaround to roll back to a previous build for the SP and it worked :) The bug got fixed on the last free day because Activision doesn`t care about the PC players.
80 euro is just too much. I vote with my wallet , i won’t pay more than €60 for any game, and for CoD my limit is $15.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206855442," Call of Duty (2025) — Same Game, Different Year

I’ve played Call of Duty for years, but at this point… it’s honestly a 1/10 experience. The series feels completely lifeless now.

1. Same Old Formula:
Every new release feels like a copy-paste of the last one. Same maps, same guns, same recycled animations — just with a new name and $70 price tag.

2. Terrible Optimization:
Even high-end PCs struggle with performance. Constant crashes, texture bugs, frame drops — it’s like the devs forgot to test it before release.

3. Pay-to-Win & Microtransactions:
You pay full price, then get bombarded with overpriced skins, bundles, and battle passes. Half the game feels locked behind a paywall.

4. Boring Campaign:
The single-player mode is short, predictable, and feels like an afterthought. It’s more like an extended tutorial for multiplayer than a real story.

5. Multiplayer Disaster:
Unbalanced weapons, hackers everywhere, skill-based matchmaking that makes every game sweaty — it’s not fun anymore.

6. Massive File Size:
Why does the game take 200+ GB for a recycled experience? At this point, downloading Call of Duty feels like installing Windows twice.


---

Call of Duty used to be the king of shooters — now it’s just a cash-grab zombie franchise. No innovation, no care, no soul.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206842188,"Black Ops 6 is the pinnacle of disappointment and a masterclass in wasting your time. This ""game"" is quite frankly a storefront disguised as an FPS shooter to suck you in and make you spend your hard earned cash. Unless you have a couple close friends to play with routinely, and you don't mind getting melted by the sweatiest of sweats and cheaters, then avoid at all costs.

Let's start with zombies mode. It is a joyless treadmill where every gun has the same mind-melting grind. Want gold? Grind 2000 headshots. Want opal? Grind 30 special zombie kills. Want the final camo? Pray to the RNG gods while repeating the same waves over and over because apparently originality is now a crime. Want the camos on a different gun? Cool, do the exact same thing, over, and over, and over again. Solo play is a nightmare. Maps are either tiny, claustrophobic corridors or “open” areas that still manage to feel like a giant hamster cage. Every second is a repeat of the last. Sound effects? Same. Enemies? Same. Narration? Same. Goals? Same. Map? Same. Your brain doesn’t even get a chance to have an original thought.

Warzone isn’t any better. Verdansk is supposedly “massive” but is as dead as a boardroom meeting. No weather, no night cycle, no environmental variety, nothing to break up the monotony. You drop in, you shoot a few sweaty players, you die, and then you do it again. And again. Don’t even get me started on the cosmetics. Hundreds of overpriced skins and AI generated slop shoved down your throat while the game itself barely delivers. With thousands of developers working on this, you’d think they could churn out at least five maps that aren’t eye wateringly dull. Instead, we get a single ugly map over and over in a sea of yellow. Genius. Imagine if we had 5 maps for instance, downtown New York city, the streets of Paris, the Amazon rain forest, African desert, and the side streets of Japan, with weather, day and night cycles to match? You would think that a company with enough money to buy a small country and enough employees to fill a city they could accomplish something, anything at all. But no.

Graphics on a high end PC? Ha. Flat, bland, texture-less, lighting that looks like it came straight from 2013, all capped for last-gen consoles. Oh you spent $2000 building a gaming PC? Sorry, you get the same graphical quality as a $300 Xbox One, aside from a few extra frames that don't even matter because lag and latency is your biggest op. Menus are glacial. Want to check an operator? Prepare to stare at a loading icon for 20 seconds like a full grown adult playing solitaire in a cave while the game attempts to load in this insanely detailed, totally not computer generated AI skin. Every interaction outside of a match is painful, and insulting.

Black Ops 6 is repetitive, uninspired, and technically sloppy. It feels like the entire game was designed as a time-sinking storefront disguised as a shooter. With its only goal being to suck as much money out of you as possible, while cosplaying as an FPS shooter so you play at least 2 hours worth and can't return. This once highly coveted franchise has simply turned into a slightly more realistic Fortnite. Progression is meaningless, maps are boring, menus are slow and broken, and zombies is an endurance test that punishes anyone with a functioning brain. Play it if you want to watch hours of your life vanish while grinding cosmetic rewards nobody asked for. Otherwise, steer clear. This is not a game. This is a punishment.",False,0,7166

Might as well go whole hog and add in some loot boxes too at this point

Right now, you have to launch the cod launcher, then launch the game, then see a LOGIN REWARD SCREEN, crash and restart, repeat, then when u enter menu you see pop up ads.
Launch campaign, crash and restart during cutscene, repeat, play the first mission, game quits to menu because server disconnect. For a SOLO session.

[h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]
* Year 2024: Game released 
* Year 2025: Started playtest on free weekend 
* 2 hours later: Great gunplay, but too similar to Cold War style
* 5 hours later: Get bore while doing stealth, glad it was just short
* 13 hours later: The ending is cinematic, but not impressive gameplay
* 15 hours later: Better version of COD Cold War

[h1]  🔊         TESTER MUST KNOW:[/h1]
* Game world timeline: 1991, sequel of Black Ops Cold War
* Allow to carry more than two type of throwing equipment
* Allow to save & quit in Solo Zombie mode

[h1] ⭐️         COMPARE TO BLACK OPS COLD WAR:[/h1]
* Added long open world scenario
* Added variety of vehicle scenario
* Added reusable Air Strike & Mortar in open world
* Added Grappling Hook
* Added Zombies in campaign
* Added upgrade system
* Added new attack tactic from the enemies
* Explosive cause more damage
* Enemies now use remote car with bomb
* Smart enemies in combat
* Longer hours campaign
* Coded door now need identify finger print on numpad to unlock
* Allow drive hummer with NPC in open world combat

[h1]  ⚠️        RUMOR CHECKING:[/h1]
* Most of the negative feedback are Multiplayer issues ➜ It seem like it

* Many players have reported that kills, rounds completed, and other statistics from solo Zombies matches are not being added to the leaderboards. ➜ True

* Game crashes across all modes (multiplayer, campaign, zombies). Disconnections / server instability. ➜ True, for now.

* Campaign being underwhelming compare to Black Ops 1 & 2 ➜ Agree

* A lot of cosmetic ads intro no matter just play for single player campaign ➜ Agree

At first, the plot seemed kind of silly, formulaic and caricatured. That's what he is. BUT! After playing for a while, I realized that this story doesn't need to be evaluated as some kind of AAA titles. She's here just to give you silly, but still fun.

I didn't play MP. That's why people buy BF.

Zombie. I haven't played, but I suspect it should be pretty good in co-op. (There are moments with zombies in the plot and it's quite playable there).

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206747415,"Call of Duty HQ is not just user-hostile annoyance, the way it is implemented in Steam environment turns it into a complete abomination.  The most recent CoD game is in your library displayed just as ""Call of Duty®"" (same for the shortcut on your desktop etc.) instead of its actual full name. Once they release next game, ""Call of Duty®"" entity migrates to it. My playtime on this thing currently is a combination of playtime of BO6 and one of the older CoDs etc. - the confusion is breaking all the neat Steam stuff that works fine for every game other than CoD.

I completely avoid CoD MP - while I understand the appeal of a MP shooter with (some) of the silly skins, I believe it is a terrible idea to combine it into one MP game with what is meant to be maybe unrealistic but definitely realistic-looking military shooter.

I guess I should thank Activision for making BO6 campaign available for free in an attempt to compete with Battlefield 6 - and I would (thank them) if they did not ruin it in the middle of the free period with a needless patch that made the campaign almost impossible to launch and highly unstable.

A good chunk of BO6 campaign is actually more fun then I expected - despite the stunning, diverse, brave and inclusive bunch of characters and some cringe character-building, it mostly works as a decent sequel to Black Ops Cold War. There is one [spoiler]hallucination/zombie[/spoiler] level that some players might find out of place but other than that it works - except the last mission, crappy Ubisoft-style [spoiler]drug trip[/spoiler].

If the BO6 campaign was playable without CoDHQ and all the online hassle and bugs, it would be well worth 10-15 bucks depending on how much of a CoD fan a player is.  As I actually experienced it, it was so-so worth the time invested at 0 bucks cost.",False,0,1433

Ожидал большего, благо играл на бесплатной неделе (но после 3-4 дней выпустили патч, так что для  доступа к сюжетке пришлось костылись, спасибо челу из обсуждений за решение). А так много стелса (кривого), всё так же пластиковый мир за рамками фокуса постановки, и ещё плитки брони добрались до сингла (!). Растянули миссией в опен ворлде, брожением в лабе аля Контрол с зомби, оборвали концовку и про героя интригу не раскрыли (модная тенденция интриговать и оставлять на сиквел). Хз как тут тот  же Гоер сюжет писал и как это делали 4 года. (хотя за сюжетку отвечали Рейвены, но чёт они не вывозят сами кампанию для Блопса, увы, хотя ребята талантливые). Виню во всём Активижн и их выдаивание не только актёров озвучки, но и разрабов и замена их ИИ.

Зомби-режим превратился в рейд на Губку Босса бездонная полоска HP, в то время как сам процесс напоминает прокачай ствол 8 раз чтобы смочь мочь против зомби, дизайн карт как в мультиплее (не очень). Но эта тенденция уже из Cold War, так что был готов кушать за обе щеки (но даже с таким настроем удивлён насколько все 6 карт идентичны, а не как раньше: когда и сеттинг уникальный, и перки только на этой карте новые, и другие уникальные для конкретной карты фишки. Ну и да, грёбаные плиты брони (!) достало.

Мультиплеер с таким ТТК превратили в аттракцион ""либо играешь с скоростельным от бедра, либо умираешь"" (отчего весь арсенал нафиг не используешь). Про скины персонажей аля киборг, Сплинтер, Сет ""несмешной комик"" Роген я молчу. Ну и танцы на победном экране, спасибо Фортнайту, стримерам и всем кому по кайфу треш в изначально серьёзном милитари шутере.

Батлрояль я вообще не трогаю, пробовал и как-то не моё. Но по сути это основная цель выхода новой колды (обновы для королевской битвы, а какие-то все ещё верящие игроки покупают сюжетку и зомбей, сделанные на сдачу от даната на Черепашек Ниндзя).

I tried so many things: reinstalling drivers, cleaning shaders cashe, reinstalling the game from steam, reducing video quality settings in Nvidia App, trying to load shaders in multiplayers map, etc. After day 2 of so unpleasant expirience I am giving up.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206692804,"I grew up with Call of Duty. I still remember playing CoD 2 on PS2, it was raw, fun, and unforgettable. Then came Modern Warfare (2007), and it blew the world away. MW2, MW3… those games defined an era. They were about gameplay, story, and respect for the player.

Fast forward to today with Black Ops 6, and what do I get? A wall of BIOS errors, TPM checks, Secure Boot demands, forced online logins, and third‑party accounts, just to play the campaign. I don’t want to be a computer scientist to enjoy a single‑player story. I don’t want to risk BIOS updates or troubleshoot firmware just to launch a game I paid for.

And it’s not just me. Another player summed it up perfectly:

Download the game

Download an update

Launch the game, it forces another update

Close, update, restart( sometimes repeat multiple times)

Try to play campaign, game closes and reopens

Campaign won’t start because of server issues

Game freezes, you relaunch, repeat… nothing works and It’s the worst gaming experience I’ve had in years.

This is not gaming. This is punishment for being a paying customer. 

Meanwhile, Activision is busy selling childish skins, battle passes, and flashy cosmetics. The franchise that once set the standard for shooters is now just a storefront with a game attached. The soul is gone.

Thank God I only tried the demo, it showed me everything I needed to know. I’d rather put my money where companies still value gamers. Honestly, even EA seems to have learned from their mistakes, Battlefield 6 looks like it actually respects players. Meanwhile, COD is a hollow shell.

I miss the days when games were made for gamers, not shareholders. I miss when you could just click on a game, play with your friends, laugh, and have fun, not fight BIOS settings, TPM firmware, endless updates, and server errors.

Well it's quite complicated, this game was so insanely addicting for the first few months, I got better, watched tips and tricks videos. I was addicted, waiting to get home so I can play COD Warzone, playing 3-10 hours a day with my friend. I couldn't stop, trying to find the weapons with the fastest time to kill, watching clickbait videos on TTK and broken weapons. I truely couldn't stop playing or thinking about it, flexing on friends, getting too happy when I get a clutch, just having a great time. Seams like I loved it, but why is it not recommended? Well, it sort of ruined my taste, making me not want to play games, but saying I will and just watching videos instead of gaming. Whenever my friends asked to play it, I said no, just not having any fun for almost 4 months, just watching videos or playing games I don't enjoy. I have now found games that I actually enjoy, having fun every time I get on my computer.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206674023,"Downloaded this because I wanted to try out Black Ops 6's campaign during the free trial period. I quite enjoyed the older Black Ops campaigns so I had hoped this would be a fun way to spend an afternoon at least. After a lengthy download, an annoying launcher to jump through and a long shader processing step I was finally ready to play. For my efforts I was greeted by constant game feel ruining stutters and weird graphical issues for the first couple missions before the game finally crashed on the third. I thought I'd restart my computer and come back to it the next day. Maybe things would be better.
The next day comes, I get to the BOps 6 campaign menu and I press the button to resume the mission I was on. Game starts loading... and never stops. Fifteen minutes later: still nothing but the black screen with the rotating orange icon in the bottom right corner. Try verifying game files and relaunching, it does nothing. See a suggestion that the game shaders might have broken themselves somehow. I look for the option to clear shaders, the menu search says its in there, but clicking on the setting from the search page brings no such setting. Another relaunch fixed this and made the option reappear. That part isn't the worst issue, just some poor interface design. I wouldn't even bring it up if it weren't for the fact that every launch requires dealing with the awful launcher which adds a couple minutes to every single launch attempt. After restarting the shader processing step again I leave the game for about an hour: 0% done. Thinking a restart might fix the issue I restart and let it run again. This time 2+ hours and still 0%. Its at this point that I decide that I'm done with this.
The only positive in this miserable excuse for a video game is that at least I didn't put any money into it. At least it served as a free lesson: teaching me never to put a single dime into this garbage.

1 Download the game,

3 Open the game, it forces you to download another update, 
4 Close the game,  download update, restart the game
4.1. Maybe redo step 4 multiple times
5. Open the game
6. If you want to play campaign for example, game will be closed and then reopened again
7. You can't play single player campaign because of some server issue
8. Game stuck, needed to close it manually and relaunch. 
9. Repeat previous step, nothing still works.


Tested multiplayer. 
Level 1, first game, literally nothing unlocked. Couple more new players in my team. All enemies are prestige level, 3 of them 500+.

Didn't like it, gameplay is completly braindead dashing around corner with SMG. Lobby full of sweats with completed loadouts, fully kitted weapons and 50+ level above me from the FIRST match (I played like 2 or 3 days after open beta started).

UPD: Zombies is OK, but nothing special really.
Still couldn't launch the campaign

UPD2: Halfway through the free period devs pushed the update which ""accidentaly"" rendered campaign unplayable which lasted until the end of the free period. Yeah there were some workaround but I see no reason to bother with that kind of attitude from Activision.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206656437,"The Call of Duty franchise has cemented itself as a true pioneer of the first-person shooter genre. From its early World War II roots to its futuristic twists and gritty modern warfare reboots, it has consistently delivered unforgettable campaigns, cinematic storytelling, and genre-defining mechanics. Whether you love it or love to complain about it, there’s no denying that Call of Duty has pushed the FPS space forward more than almost any other franchise.

One of the brightest jewels in its modern crown is Warzone Resurgence — a masterclass in fast-paced, high-adrenaline gameplay. The fluidity of combat, constant re-engagement, and that addicting loop of ""just one more drop"" makes it one of the most replayable modes in battle royale history. It’s chaotic, it’s exhilarating, and it’s pure dopamine in digital form.

That said, no franchise is perfect — and Skill-Based Matchmaking (SBMM) remains the series' most baffling decision. In public lobbies, SBMM simply doesn’t belong. If it's not ranked, then it shouldn’t play like ranked. Random matchmaking based solely on ping and connection quality should be the default. The idea of manipulating lobbies — and even worse, skill-based hit registration — is downright absurd in any mode. It punishes good players, suffocates casual players, and ultimately hurts the experience for everyone.

But here’s the thing: for the first time in a long time, I’m feeling genuine excitement for what’s next.

Black Ops 7 looks like the return to form we’ve been begging for. The promise of SBMM changes, fresh movement mechanics, and — most importantly — a continuation of the legendary Black Ops 2 storyline has me all in. In fact, I’ve already purchased the Vault Edition for the first time ever, which should tell you everything about my expectations.

Call of Duty isn’t just surviving — it’s evolving. And if Black Ops 7 delivers on its promises, we might be entering a new golden era.",True,0,80814

Okay, this game was amazing. First off all, this is the only Black Ops game I played after finishing the first 2 and this game had one of the best gameplay features from the previous games. The story was good, the twists in this game hit just like the ones in Black Ops 1 and 2. Of course, a game cannot simply just be perfection and in this game it’s the same with its flaws. Some missions were really good and meanwhile some were absolutely trash. In my opinion, High Rollers was the best mission in this game and Emergence was one of the worst in this game. The characters had so much detail and backstory presented in this game through interaction and dialogue choices. I really liked the gameplay in this game and its been really improved from Black Ops 1 and 2. The variety of weapons in this game also deserves a mention as they are really great. The ending is kinda mysterious because I have no idea of the person showed in the end of the cut-scene. That’s all honestly and I wish that Call of Duty will still bring out good, great and masterpiece story campaigns over the other games they make in the future, because this one was amazing. I really liked this game,

1. Got 130hrs just because of warzone. But then I realized how big of a problem aim assist is. Every game that I've played since I found out about aim assist seemed unfair. I did my best to track the enemy, but I ended up dying anyway, even though it took less effort from him than it took me.
2. Some of the skins are really good. However they don't fit CoD at all. Skins wouldn't be a problem if I was talking about fortnite but since its CoD skins are more than a problem here. Playing this game makes me feel like I'm about to throw up or as if I'm high.
3. FOR PEOPLE WHO CONSIDER BUYING BO 7:
I played bo7 open beta and the game feels the same as bo6. Play free access while you still can and then decide whether you wanna buy bo7 or not. But personally I'd recommend bf6.",False,1,7854
Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206602148,"I played during the free week because I love the CoD Zombies from WaW to BO4, I played every single one including infinite warfare zombies and Ghost Aliens. I liked BO3 so much that I learned the mod tools and made the Courage the Cowardly Dog map for it.

I figured I may as well try out the zombies mode on BO6 while its free. I did not like it. I played the first 3 maps, I did not get very far but it's nothing like the game I enjoyed. The UI is atrocious, the ads and the loading screens and getting the game to run in the first place took over an hour before I was able to even play. It does not look like zombies and it does not play like zombies. WaW through BO4 actually felt like Zombies. This is something else. I don't know how to describe it other than bad. Killing zombies and progressing rounds did not feel engaging, I was not enjoying any of it. The guns were bad, the zombies fell and shambled all over the place, the spider scorpion wannabe dogs were dumb. The wannabe parasites that are annoying to shoot. The weird health bars over all the zombies heads. None of it feels engaging, its a weird shell or skinwalker in zombies image. 

The maps are also uninspired and bad. It all looks the same and it all plays the same and none of it was memorable. Liberty falls was the worst one, just a random city with a random church in it. How is it that the remake of nuketown (BO4) has more character than liberty falls? The other map I played that I can't even remember the name of looked like a confusing mix of Call of the Dead + Mob of the dead + Five without anything redeeming either. I got on a boat for some reason and drove around but the zombies don't swim so you can just sit on the boat seemingly forever as long as you don't get out. I got out of the boat to shoot some of them just standing on the edge of the beach and then took damage and died. Very cool, what an interesting mechanic.

I'm glad I didn't buy this and I appreciate them giving it out for free to show the remaining few hundred people like me that they made the right choice in not purchasing it. My suggestion is to just never buy a new CoD game and play the old ones in local, they will hold up until the end of time. BO1 to BO3 will never not be fun to play once in a while.",False,0,114

In 7 to 8 out of every 10 matches, you'll encounter hackers (like wallhackers and aimbot users) or Cronus Zen users all of whom have a clear advantage over legitimate players. These players openly use cheats, and even after reporting them, Activision’s anti-cheat system takes no visible action.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206534504,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 became free temporarily this week because Battlefield 6 just launched as a desperate attempt of increasing its players. This did not work at all.

This is not a review about plot or gameplay. 

It seems that, in their frantic move of making the game free, the developers forgot the various abysmal issues of COD HQ. Or, perhaps they ignored them. My multiple attempts to start the game all appeared futile, due to the laughable anticheat service preventing the instance from starting. This, though, has not discourage me from trying yet again to play the campaign. I thus uninstalled and reinstalled the gigantic 180 gigabytes of resources (itself a result of the refusal of the developers to optimize or compress the unreasonably large texture packs). 

After reinstall I was finally able to launch the game, but yet again, I was not able to play the campaign. On startup, a window popped up and informed me the app required an update. I ignored the fact that I've just reinstalled, and clicked proceed. The page started to shift between two prompts: ""accessing relay"" and ""downloading update"". Then, unfortunately, an error popped up indicating failure. Clicking ""restart update"" was fruitless, so I terminated the process. My various struggles in vain had finally convinced me that I would never be able to solve the issue on my own, thus I consulted various videos on Youtube. The exorbitant amount of different tweaks to internet, bluetooth, drivers, settings and compatibility all proved ineffectual. Desperate, I decided to make one final try, and if the game still refuses to launch, I would uninstall.

To my surprise, the next time I launched, the issue miraculously solved itself. I am suddenly overwhelmed with excitement: perhaps I'll be able to play the campaign after all! 

Little did I suspect of the obstacles I would face next. 

After a compulsory account creation process, I was prompted to ""connect phone number to Steam."" Despite my unwillingness to do so I proceeded. Finally, the login process finished. Upon reaching main page, I am forced to click through 2 advertisements of their extremely dull-witted Battle Pass and skip through a video showcasing the multitude of gormless-but-colorful weapon skins. In the end, I reached the actual launch button.

I clicked, full of hope. 

""Accessing relay"" appears yet again, with process stuck at 0%, shattering my final attempt.

In my rage, I uninstalled the game, and decided that, indeed, this was it.

As you can see, fellow new and old players who happen to stumble upon this review, the developers have truly abandoned this dreadful, unoptimized product. You can also see that my whole ""35 minutes"" of playtime registered on account is entirely dedicated to trying to get this calamity to start. It is impossible to imagine this as the developers' attempt to affect BF6 sales, yet here it is. To me, even a game with bad plot is acceptable sometimes. A game that refuses to launch, forces me to babysit it to even reach start page, then gets stuck again miserably is never acceptable.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206531706,"Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Review

“The nature of our enemy is unclear now.”

Black Ops 6 is the game that has everything but delivers nothing. It has incredible gun play, smooth FPS movement, jaw dropping graphics, and talented voice actors and game developers. And yet, it has no soul, no humanity, and no worthwhile message to impart to the world. Call of Duty cannot help but indulge in its insecurities about America, telling its audience that “there are always enemies” to defeat, murder, kill, and pillage. In this entry, American guns go inward toward an internal spy conspiracy that feels generic and unsubstantial while washing its hands off any political context despite being set during the Gulf War. 

Let’s start with the positives. Black Ops 6 has truly refined gunplay that evokes an addictive quality. It’s no mystery that CoD has survived in the gaming landscape despite its consistent mediocrity. The gameplay is just that good and the people always want more. The new omnidirectional movement is a reinvigorating addition to the franchise, giving Black Ops 6’s character movement both weight and smoothness that’s satisfying to any gamer. The guns hit hard with the recoil animations, reload animations, and gunfire sounds. Call of Duty has perfected War as Entertainment and the reason why people will keep coming back for more. 

But all the shiny veneer is immediately revealed as the epitome of mediocrity with Black Op 6’s campaign. Despite some incredible missions with top notch game design, Black Op 6’s narrative fails to deliver on nearly every level. The opening mission, set in Kuwait during the Gulf War, boasts beautiful visuals but a poor player experience. It’s a boring mission, employing all the usual CoD cliches to apathetic effect. But the next mission, set in the fictional city state of Avalon, is a very good mission with game design that allows for player freedom to approach the level with combat or stealth. This is the status quo for the campaign. For every high quality mission, it will be followed by mediocrity and desperation and this continues until the very end. 

The game’s best mission, High Rollers, shows us what this game could have been if they committed to a singular vision. It’s almost innovative, highly entertaining, and develops character rapport for its cast. It’s Ocean’s Eleven but with CIA agents, a great combination.

The mission, Emergence, is a particular highlight of this game’s poor quality, employing outlandish plot elements and poorly designed gameplay to throw off the player from the typical CoD routine. It reads as a rip-off of better games such as Control and it hurts the experience. Perhaps YOU ARE better off playing Control. You only have one life after all.

The campaign is also, somehow, allergic to tackling political themes despite being a game about the Gulf War, internal CIA politics, and espionage. It is not interested in analyzing America’s role in armed conflict or the consequences of American Interventionism through agencies like the CIA. Instead, you get a run of the mill spy story about an evil organization and reinforce America’s position as the top dog of the world. It’s America, World Police nonsense that should have been thrown out years ago.
Let this be my indictment against the entire franchise after 2012. Black Ops 6 is everything Call of Duty has become. American Imperialist propaganda designed to reinforce America’s “integrity” in mainstream culture while indulging in its insecurities as Earth’s leading nation. It will say that “there is always an enemy” in an attempt to justify the endless perpetuation of War and State Violence by America. The real horror of Call of Duty is how it normalizes this rhetoric. War, killing, torture, and the destruction of human rights is “okay” as long as its for Mother America. Call of Duty Black Ops 6 feels like its written by unquestioning ghouls, resulting in no human qualities in the narrative whatsoever. What remains is the husk of War masquerading as addictive entertainment. In a fair world, $400 million dollars would not be spent on these games.

Remember, there are better and more fulfilling games to play.

Stop playing Call of Duty.

I have played CoD since World at War. This isn't even a game anymore, this is a storefront with a shell of a game attached to it. There is too much wrong with this franchise and Activision I can even write in 1 review.

Call of Duty is unrecognizable compared to last year, and next year it will be unrecognizable from how it is now. This game will turn into a shallow AI Fortnite and the studios we once loved are only still the same in name, nothing else. If you think this game is AI slop now, just wait.

So, why would you still play? Why would you support this?
Even if you still play this game and disagree with me, can't you agree it could be so much better? If you have FOMO for Call of Duty, why? It's like checking a dead body for a pulse. Let it go.

Vote for a better game with your wallet and your time. Sadly it really is the only way.

It's... bad...
Haven't played any CoD in a while. Multiplayer was great in CoD MW2 and even though they let cheaters back in the game after the release of MW3, but it was still fun. Oh... right... I'm talking about old MW2 from 2009 of course. Don't play Multiplayer nowadays, but the campaign was quite good back then too and I like a good shooter campaign. Battlefield 4, the old Modern Warfare trilogy or Titanfall 2? Great campaigns. And now BO6 is even free to play for a few days, so I can finally play a few hours worth of campaign without paying at least 20 bucks, which still is the usual 50% off ""deal"" even for older CoD games.

Well... as you can see, I've played the CoD:BO6 campaign for a little over an hour. I expected nothing much. Just some over the top epic action mixed with a basic story. Similar plain old fun, like the old Modern Warfare Trilogy did it.

Why didn't I play more? Well.. I expected over the top action and got woke bullsh!t. I usually don't care about the characters of a game, but I still hate ""inclusion overload"", where it's obvious that they cared more for the number of ""inclusive characters"" than anything else. Boss-Lady, wheel-chair dude, guy with huge-a** nerd glasses right at the beginning and then another boss-lady with short hair in the second mission. But of course, she's actually really cool, since there's playing loud cool music in the van when we meet her...

In moderation it would be ok. Heck, if the story would be extremely engaging from the get-go and therefore kinda distract from them, then I probably wouldn't even mind those characters. But the slow and non-engaging beginning pretty much directs your attention on the characters. Pair this with a statistically very unlikely combination of characters, which reach pretty much ""in your face"" levels of ""inclusion for inclusions sake"" and the only thing I'm saying is: ""Thanks, I hate it!""",False,0,73

Played for just a couple of days — and boom, temporary ban.
Didn’t cheat, didn’t exploit, didn’t do anything weird. Just played.

Thank God I didn’t spend money on this mess. Imagine paying full price only to get banned while cheaters still run around untouched.

I’ve been gaming since the ‘90s. But I haven’t seen this kind of sh.it from a game in a long time — battle passes, microtransactions, and buggy bans.

Now it’s a paradise for cheaters and a punishment zone for honest players, even those who paid for the game — no refunds, no explanations.

To every cheater out there: without your hacks you’re nothing.
And to Activision — congrats on turning a legendary franchise into a greedy, soulless machine.
Keep banning real players, and soon there’ll be no one left but bots and exploiters.

🎯 Battlefield — please, finish what’s left of them.

Verdict: 0/10
Would I recommend this game? Only to cheaters — they’re clearly the only ones having fun.


Предупреждение от ветерана — Call of Duty потеряла душу

Поиграл всего пару дней — и получил временный бан.
Не читал, не эксплуатировал, ничего странного не делал. Просто играл.

Слава Богу, что я не успел купить эту ерунду. Представьте — платите полную цену, а банят именно вас, пока читеры спокойно играют дальше.

Я играю с 90-х. Но такого дерь…ма от игры, как здесь, давно не видел — баттлпассы, донат и глючные баны.

Теперь это рай для читеров и зона наказаний для честных игроков, даже тех, кто купил игру — без возврата, без объяснений.

Читеры без своих хаков — ничто.
А Activision — поздравляю, вы превратили легендарную серию в бездушную машину жадности.

Despite making MWII and MWIII as separated games to download, you still need to re-download them, from which MWII takes up 25GB without DLCs, MW2019 takes up 80GB without DLCs.

Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206400745,"🎮 Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – A Review by a Totally Not-Addicted Gamer 🎮

If you’ve ever wanted to feel like a 90s action movie star, a Cold War spy, and a zombie-slaying maniac—all while yelling at 12-year-olds who somehow have better aim than you—then Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is your new digital home.

🕵️‍♂️ Campaign: Mission: Implausible The campaign is a glorious mashup of Mission: Impossible, Jason Bourne, and Scooby-Doo if Scooby carried an M4 and had a vendetta against bioweapons. You’ll sneak into political galas, rob casinos, and even rub shoulders with Bill Clinton (yes, really). It’s like someone let a Red Bull-fueled screenwriter loose in a history museum and said, “Make it explode”.

🎯 Multiplayer: John Woo Meets Gym Class Multiplayer is where this game flexes its muscles—literally. The new “omni-movement” system lets you slide, dive, wall-hop, and probably do your taxes mid-air if you’re skilled enough. Every match feels like a deleted scene from Hard-Boiled, minus the doves (but give it time).

🧟‍♂️ Zombies: The Undead Are Back, Baby Zombies mode is back and cheesier than a 90s pizza commercial. You’ll fight off waves of the undead while solving puzzles, unlocking safehouses, and wondering why the guy in the hazmat suit is doing Dark Souls dodge rolls while throwing Joker gas. It’s absurd, it’s campy, and it’s glorious.

💥 Final Verdict: Black Ops 6 is like a triple-shot espresso with a side of C4. It’s not perfect—some campaign moments feel like they were written by a committee of confused time travelers—but it’s the most fun I’ve had yelling “Tango down!” since I accidentally scared my cat with a Nerf gun.

⭐ 8.5/10 – Would definitely recommend, especially if you enjoy high-octane chaos, nostalgic espionage, and the sweet, sweet sound of a perfectly timed headshot.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go back to arguing with a 13-year-old about who really carried the last match. Spoiler: it was me. Probably.",True,0,7522

",True,0,65794
Call of Duty HQ,1938090,206399061,"Gameplay Fatigue
Omnimovement 2.0 promised fluidity, but wall-jumping and multi-directional slides feel gimmicky rather than game-changing. The movement perks system adds complexity without meaningful payoff.

Overclocking gear sounds cool on paper, but in practice, it creates imbalance. Players who master the system dominate, while casuals get steamrolled.

Storyline Confusion
Set in 2035, the campaign tries to be cerebral, with psychological warfare and fear-based manipulation. But the narrative is bloated and hard to follow, especially for those not steeped in Black Ops lore.

David Mason returns, but his arc feels recycled. The emotional stakes are low, and the villain’s “weaponized fear” concept is underdeveloped.

Zombies Mode: Stale Brains
The new “Ashes of the Damned” map introduces a Wonder Vehicle, but it’s more novelty than necessity. The round-based format feels dated, and the undead AI lacks challenge.

Despite returning characters, the mode doesn’t evolve meaningfully. It’s nostalgic, but not fresh.

Multiplayer Misfires
Treyarch removed skill-based matchmaking (SBMM), which sounds great for veterans—but it’s chaos for newcomers. Lobbies are now wildly unbalanced.

Persistent lobbies are back, but they often devolve into spawn-trap nightmares. The new maps are visually striking but suffer from poor pacing and choke points.

Monetization & Cosmetics
Vault Edition skins and in-game purchases are everywhere. While Treyarch promised fewer “stupid character skins,” the cosmetic overload still feels like a cash grab.

Verdict: A Missed Opportunity
Black Ops 7 tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing few. It’s a Frankenstein of past mechanics, experimental ideas, and corporate polish—but it lacks soul. If you’re nostalgic for the glory days of Black Ops 2, this won’t scratch the itch. If you’re new to the franchise, it’s a rough onboarding.",False,0,1841

Because activision only scrapes the bare minimum together, has the balls to charge 70 dollars for less than a quarter of the content we would have gotten 10 years ago, and then tricks and brainwashes people into believing that their not chasing a carrot on a stick.

Its incredible that this company can only deliver less and less to players every year, but still manages to make a profit every year, and pad the pockets of men and women who only want to squeeze the last dollar out of you for nothing in return if they could.
